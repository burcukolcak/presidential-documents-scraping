# Scraping Presidential Documents from the Web & Data for Presidential Speeches 

This repo contains a code sample for scraping presidential documents from the website ["American Presidency Project" (APP)](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/). 

The code enables researchers to scrape and parse presidential speeches for all US Presidents over their entire presidency periods. Researchers can easily tweak the code to modify the document category, the presidents, and the time period.

You can also find the data for the presidential speeches of all presidents (including Biden's first year) in this repo. Each president's speeches are stored under separate folders as txt files.
