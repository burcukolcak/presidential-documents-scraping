Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate:
I lay before you a letter from His Most Christian Majesty, addressed to the President and Members of Congress of the United States of America.
GO. WASHINGTON.
To our very dear friends and allies, the President and Members of the General Congress of the United States of North America.
VERY DEAR GREAT FRIENDS AND ALLIES: We have received the letter by which you inform us of the new mark of confidence that you have shown to Mr. Jefferson, and which puts a period to his appointment of minister plenipotentiary at our Court.
The manner in which he conducted during his residence with us has merited our esteem and entire approbation, and it is with pleasure that we now give him this testimony of it.
It is with the most sincere pleasure that we embrace this opportunity of renewing these assurances of regard and friendship which we feel for the United States in general and for each of them in particular. Under their influence we pray God that He will keep you, very dear friends and allies, under His holy and beneficent protection.
Done at Paris this 11th September, 1790.
Your good friend and ally,
LOUIS. MONTMORIN.
THE UNITED STATES OF NORTH AMERICA.
