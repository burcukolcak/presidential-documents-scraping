George Washington
May 26, 1794

Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
The commissioners of His Catholic Majesty having communicated to the Secretary of State the form of a certificate without which the vessels of the United States can not be admitted into the ports of Spain, I think it proper to lay it before Congress.
GO. WASHINGTON.
