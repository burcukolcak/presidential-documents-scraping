Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
I received yesterday from the judge of the district of South Carolina a letter, inclosing the presentments of the grand jury to him, and stating the causes which have prevented the return of the census from that district, copies of which are now laid before you.
GO. WASHINGTON.
