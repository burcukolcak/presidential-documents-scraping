George Washington
November 25, 1794

Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
I lay before you a statement of the troops in the service of the United States, which has been submitted to me by the Secretary of War. It will rest with Congress to consider and determine whether further inducements shall be held out for entering into the military service of the United States in order to complete the establishment authorized by law.
GO. WASHINGTON.
