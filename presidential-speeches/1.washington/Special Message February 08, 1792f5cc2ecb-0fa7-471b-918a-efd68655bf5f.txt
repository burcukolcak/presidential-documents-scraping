Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
An article of expense having occurred in the Department of Foreign Affairs for which no provision has been made by law, I lay before you a letter from the Secretary of State explaining the same, in order that you may do thereon what you shall find to be right.
GO. WASHINGTON.
