Special Message
To the House of Representatives of the United States:
I transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury, bearing date this day, with the accompanying papers, in answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 16th ultimo, relative to removals from office, etc.
These statements should have accompanied those from the other Departments on the same subject transmitted in my message to the House on the 7th ultimo,* but which have been delayed for reasons stated in the letter of the Secretary of the Treasury above referred to.
JOHN TYLER.
