John Tyler
March 30, 1842

Special Message
To the House of Representatives of the United States:
I transmit to the House of Representatives two extracts from a note of the charge' d'affaires of the Republic of Texas accredited to this Government to the Department of State, one suggesting in behalf of his Government such modifications of the existing laws of the United States as will impart greater facility to the trade between the two countries, particularly to that which passes across their frontier, and the other expressing a desire for some regulation on the part of this Government by means of which the communication by post between the United States and Texas may be improved.
As the wishes of the Texan Government in relation to those subjects can only be gratified by means of laws to be passed by Congress, they are accordingly referred to the consideration of the two Houses.
JOHN TYLER.
(The same message was sent to the Senate.)
