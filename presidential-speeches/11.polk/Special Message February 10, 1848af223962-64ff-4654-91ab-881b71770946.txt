Special Message
To the House of Representatives of the United States:
In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 7th instant, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State.
No communication has been received from Mexico "containing propositions from the Mexican authorities or commissioners for a treaty of peace," except the "counter projet" presented by the Mexican commissioners to the commissioners of the United States on the 6th of September last, a copy of which, with the documents accompanying it, I communicated to the Senate of the United States on the 2d instant. A copy of my communication to the Senate embracing this "projet" is herewith communicated.
