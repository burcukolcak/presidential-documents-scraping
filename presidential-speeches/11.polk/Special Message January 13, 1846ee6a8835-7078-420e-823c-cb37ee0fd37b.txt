James K. Polk
January 13, 1846

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit to the Senate a report of the Secretary of War, with accompanying papers, showing the measures which have been adopted in relation to the transfer of certain stocks between the Chickasaw and Choctaw Indians under the treaty between those tribes of the 24th March, 1837. The claim presented by the Choctaw General Council, if deemed to be rounded in equity, can not be adjusted without the previous advice and consent of the Senate.
JAMES K. POLK.
