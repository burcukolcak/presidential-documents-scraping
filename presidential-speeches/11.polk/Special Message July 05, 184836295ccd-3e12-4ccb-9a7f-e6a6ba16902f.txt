Special Message
To the Senate of the United States.
I submit herewith, for such action as the Senate shall deem proper, a report of the Secretary of War, suggesting a discrepancy between the resolutions of the Senate of the 15th and the 27th ultimo, advising and consenting to certain appointments and promotions in the Army of the United States.
JAMES K. POLK.
WAR DEPARTMENT,
Washington,July 1, 1848.
The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
SIR: I have the honor to submit herewith a report from the Adjutant-General of the Army, inviting attention to a difficulty arising from the terms of certain confirmations made by the resolutions of the Senate of the 15th and 27th ultimo, the former advising and consenting to the reappointment of Captain Edward Deas, Fourth Artillery, who had been dismissed the service, and the latter advising and consenting to the promotion of First Lieutenant Joseph Roberts to be captain,viceDeas, dismissed, and Second Lieutenant John A. Brown to be first lieutenant,viceRoberts, promoted.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. L. MARCY,
Secretary of War.
ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,
Washington,June 29, 1848.
Hon. W. L. Marcy,
Secretary of War.
SIR: In a list of confirmations of regular promotions just received from the Senate, dated the 27th instant, it is observed, under the heading "Fourth Regiment of Artillery," that First Lieutenant Joseph Roberts is confirmed as a captain,vice Deas,dismissed, and Second Lieutenant John A. Brown as first lieutenant,viceRoberts, promoted.
The President, having decided to reinstate Captain Deas, nominated him for restoration to the Senate the 12th instant, withdrawing, as the records show, at the same time the names of Lieutenants Roberts and Brown. This nomination of Captain Deas was confirmed the 15th of June, and he has been commissioned accordingly. I respectfully bring this matter to your notice under the impression that as the resolutions of June 15 and June 27 conflict with each other it may be the wish of the Senate to reconcile them by rescinding that portion of the latter which advises and consents to the promotions of Lieutenants Roberts and Brown.
Respectfully submitted.
R. JONES,Adjutant-General.
