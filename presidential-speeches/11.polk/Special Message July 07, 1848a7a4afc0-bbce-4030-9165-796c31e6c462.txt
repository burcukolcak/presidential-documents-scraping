Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
For the reasons mentioned in the accompanying letter of the Secretary of War, I ask that the date in the promotion of Captain W. J. Hardee, Second Dragoons, to be major by brevet for gallant and meritorious conduct in the affair at Madellin, Mexico, be changed to the 25th of March, 1847, the day on which the action occurred.
JAMES K. POLK.
WAR DEPARTMENT,
Washington,July 7, 1848.
The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
SIR: Captain W. J. Hardee, Second Dragoons, has been promoted to be major by brevet for gallant and meritorious conduct in the affair at Madellin, Mexico, to date from the 26th of March, 1847. As this affair took place on the 25th of that month, I respectfully recommend that the Senate be asked to change the date of Captain Hardee's brevet rank so as to correspond with the date of the action, to wit, the 25th of March, 1847. Brevets which have been conferred upon other officers in the same affair take the latter date.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. L. MARCY,
Secretary of War.
