Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I communicate herewith a report of the Secretary of War, with the accompanying documents, in answer to the resolution of the Senate the 28th February, 1848, requesting the President to communicate "any information he may at any time have received of the desire of any considerable portion of the people of any of the States of Mexico to be incorporated within the limits of any territory to be acquired from the Republic of Mexico, and particularly that he communicate any late proposition which has been made to that effect through General Wool or any other military officer in Mexico."
JAMES K. POLK.
