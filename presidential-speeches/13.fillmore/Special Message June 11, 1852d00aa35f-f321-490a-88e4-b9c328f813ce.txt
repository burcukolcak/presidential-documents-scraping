Millard Fillmore
June 11, 1852

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit to Congress a report from the Secretary of State, on the subject of the disorders on the Rio Grande frontier, and recommend the legislation which it suggests, in order that the duties and obligations of this Government occasioned thereby may be more effectually discharged and the peace and security of the inhabitants of the United States in that quarter more efficiently maintained.
MILLARD FILLMORE.
