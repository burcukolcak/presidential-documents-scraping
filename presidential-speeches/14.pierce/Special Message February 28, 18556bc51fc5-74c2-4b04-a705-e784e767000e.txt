Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
For eminent services in the late war with Mexico, I nominate Major General Winfield Scott, of the Army of the United States, to be lieutenant-general by brevet in the same, to take rank as such from March 29, 1847, the day on which the United States forces under his command captured Vera Cruz and the castle of San Juan de Ulna.
FRANKLIN PIERCE.
