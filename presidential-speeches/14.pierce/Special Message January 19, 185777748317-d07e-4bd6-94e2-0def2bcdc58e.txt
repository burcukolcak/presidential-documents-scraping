Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
Soon after the close of the last session of Congress I directed steps to be taken to carry into effect the joint resolution of August 28, 1856, relative to the restoration of the shipResoluteto Her Britannic Majesty's Service. The ship was purchased of the salvors at the sum appropriated for the purchase, and "after being fully repaired and equipped" was sent to England under control of the Secretary of the Navy. The letter from Her Majesty's minister for foreign affairs, now communicated to Congress in conformity with his request, and copies of correspondence from the files of the Departments of State and of the Navy, also transmitted herewith, will apprise you of the manner in which the joint resolution has been fully executed and show how agreeable the proceeding has been to Her Majesty's Government.
FRANKLIN PIERCE.
