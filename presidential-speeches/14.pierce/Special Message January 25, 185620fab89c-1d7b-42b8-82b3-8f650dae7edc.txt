Franklin Pierce
January 25, 1856

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
By the inclosed letter of the Secretary of the Treasury it appears that $24,233 belonging to the Chickasaw Indians should be invested in stocks of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. I therefore recommend that the necessary authority be given for that purpose.
FRANKLIN PIERCE.
