Franklin Pierce
July 26, 1854

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit a report from the Secretary of State, in answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 23d of May last, relative to the slave trade in the island of Cuba.
The information contained in the papers accompanying the report will, it is believed, be considered important, and perhaps necessary to enable the Senate to form an opinion upon the subjects to which they relate; but doubts may be entertained in regard to the expediency of publishing some of the documents at this juncture.
This communication is accordingly addressed to the Senate in executive session, in order that a discretion may be exercised in regard to its publication.
FRANKLIN PIERCE.
