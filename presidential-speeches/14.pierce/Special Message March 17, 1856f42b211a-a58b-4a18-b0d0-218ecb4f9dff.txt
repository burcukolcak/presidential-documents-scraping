Franklin Pierce
March 17, 1856

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit to Congress the copy of a correspondence which has recently taken place between Her Britannic Majesty's minister accredited to this Government and the Secretary of State, in order that the expediency of sanctioning the acceptance by the officers of the United States who were in the American expedition in search of Sir John Franklin of such token of thankfulness as may be offered to them on the part of Her Majesty's Government for their services on the occasion referred to maybe taken into consideration.
FRANKLIN PIERCE.
