Franklin Pierce
May 02, 1854

Special Message
To the House of Representatives:
I transmit the report * of the Secretary of State in compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 5th ultimo.
It is presumed that the omission from the resolution of the usual clause giving the Executive a discretion in its answer was accidental, and as there does not appear to be anything in the accompanying papers which upon public considerations should require them to be withheld, they are communicated accordingly.
FRANKLIN PIERCE.
*Relating to the application of Rev. James Cook Richmond for redress of wrongs alleged to have been committed by Austrian authorities in pest, and to the refusal to grant an exequatur upon the commission of the United States consul appointed for Trieste.
