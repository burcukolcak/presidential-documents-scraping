James Buchanan
January 13, 1859

Special Message
To the House of Representatives:
I herewith transmit a report from the Comptroller, with a copy of the letter of Messrs. Johnson and Williams, in relation to the decision upon the Carmick & Ramsey claim.
This should have accompanied the papers which have already been transmitted to the House, but was omitted by mistake.
JAMES BUCHANAN.
