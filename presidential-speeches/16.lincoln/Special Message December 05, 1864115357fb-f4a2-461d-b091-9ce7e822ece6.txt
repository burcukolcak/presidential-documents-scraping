Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
By virtue of the authority contained in the sixth section of the act of 21st April, 1864, which enacts "that any officer in the naval service, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, may be advanced not exceeding thirty numbers in his own grade for distinguished conduct in battle or extraordinary heroism," I recommend Lieutenant-Commander James S. Thornton, United States Navy, the executive officer of the United States steamerKearsarge, for advancement in his grade ten numbers, to take rank next after Lieutenant-Commander William D. Whiting, for his good conduct and faithful discharge of his duties in the brilliant action with the rebel steamerAlabama, which led to the destruction of that vessel on the 19th June, 1864.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
