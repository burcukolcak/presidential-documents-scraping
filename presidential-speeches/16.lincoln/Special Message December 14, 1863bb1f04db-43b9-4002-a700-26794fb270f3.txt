Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I lay before the Senate, for its constitutional action thereon, a treaty concluded at the Sac and Fox Agency, in Kansas, on the 3d day of September, 1863, between William P. Dole, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and William G. Coffin, superintendent of Indian affairs for the southern superintendency, on the part of the United States, and the Creek Nation of Indians, represented by its chiefs.
A letter from the Secretary of the Interior, dated the 12th instant, accompanies the treaty.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
