Abraham Lincoln
December 17, 1861

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit to the Senate, for its advice, a copy of a draft for a convention with the Republic of Mexico, proposed to the Government of that Republic by Mr. Corwin, the minister of the United States accredited to that Government, together with the correspondence relating to it.
As the subject is of momentous interest to the two Governments at this juncture, the early consideration of it by the Senate is very desirable.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
