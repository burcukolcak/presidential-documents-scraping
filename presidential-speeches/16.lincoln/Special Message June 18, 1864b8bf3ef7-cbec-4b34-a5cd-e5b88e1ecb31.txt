Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
In further answer to the Senate's resolution of the 28th ultimo, requesting to be informed whether the President "has, and when, authorized a person alleged to have committed a crime against Spain or any of its dependencies to be delivered up to officers of that Government, and whether such delivery was had, and, if so, under what authority of law or of treaty it was done," I transmit a copy of a dispatch of the 10th instant to the Secretary of State from the acting consul of the United States at Havana.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
