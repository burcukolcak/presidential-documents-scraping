Executive Order
DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Whereas, pursuant to the order of the President and as a means required by the public safety, directions were issued from this Department, under date of the 17th of December, 1864, requiring passports from all travelers entering the United States, except immigrant passengers directly entering an American port from a foreign country; and
Whereas the necessities which required the adoption of that measure are believed no longer to exist:
Now, therefore, the President directs that from and after this date the order above referred to shall be, and the same is hereby, rescinded.
Nothing in this regulation, however, will be construed to relieve from due accountability any enemies of the United States or offenders against their peace and dignity who may hereafter seek to enter the country or at any time be found within its lawful jurisdiction.
WILLIAM H. SEWARD.
