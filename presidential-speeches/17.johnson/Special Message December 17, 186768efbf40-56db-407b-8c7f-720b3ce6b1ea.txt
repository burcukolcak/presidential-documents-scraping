Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit, for the consideration of the Senate, an agreement between the diplomatic representatives of certain foreign powers in Japan, including the minister of the United States, on the one part, and plenipotentiaries on the part of the Japanese Government, relative to the settlement of Yokohama.
This instrument can not be legally binding upon the United States unless sanctioned by the Senate. There appears to be no objection to its approval.
A copy of General Van Valkenburgh's dispatch to the Secretary of State, by which the agreement was accompanied, and of the map to which it refers, are also herewith transmitted.
ANDREW JOHNSON.
