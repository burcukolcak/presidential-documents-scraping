Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit to Congress a copy of a convention between the United States and the Mexican Republic, providing for the adjustment of the claims of citizens of either country against the other, signed on the 4th day of July last, and the ratifications of which were exchanged on the 1st instant.
It is recommended that such legislation as may be necessary to carry this convention into effect shall receive early consideration.
ANDREW JOHNSON.
