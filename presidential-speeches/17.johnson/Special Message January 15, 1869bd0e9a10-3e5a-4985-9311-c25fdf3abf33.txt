Andrew Johnson
January 15, 1869

Special Message
To the State of the United States:
I transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view of its ratification, a copy of a convention between the United States and Great Britain. signed yesterday at London, providing for the adjustment of all outstanding claims of the citizens and subjects of the parties, respectively. It is expected that the original of the convention will be forwarded by the steamer which leaves Liverpool to-morrow. Circumstances, however, to which it is unnecessary to advert, in my judgment make it advisable to communicate to the Senate the copy referred to in advance of the arrival of the original instrument.
ANDREW JOHNSON.
