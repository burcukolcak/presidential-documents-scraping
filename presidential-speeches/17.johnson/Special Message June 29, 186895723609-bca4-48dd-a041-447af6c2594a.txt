Andrew Johnson
June 29, 1868

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit to Congress a copy of a dispatch from the United States consul at Elsinore, and of an instruction from the Secretary of State to the United States minister at Copenhagen, relative to an alleged practice of the Danish authorities to banish convicts to this country. The expediency of making it a penal offense to bring such persons to the United States is submitted to your consideration.
ANDREW JOHNSON.
