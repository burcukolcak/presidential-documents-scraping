Ulysses S. Grant
March 14, 1870

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
In reply to your resolution of the 14th of February, requesting to be informed whether I desire that any of the Indian treaties now pending before you be considered confidentially, I have to inform you that there are none of them which I object to having discussed in open session.
U. S. GRANT.
