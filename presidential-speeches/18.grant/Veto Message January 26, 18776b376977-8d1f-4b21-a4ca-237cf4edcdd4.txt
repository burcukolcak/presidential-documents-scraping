The PRESIDENT.
SIR: I have the honor to return herewith Senate bill 685, "to place the name of Daniel H. Kelly upon the muster roll of Company F, Second Tennessee Infantry," with the report of the Adjutant-General, as follows:
"The inclosed act directs the Secretary of War to place the name of Daniel H, Kelly upon the muster roll of Company F, Second Tennessee Infantry, to date December 1, 1861. There is no record of the enlistment, service, or death of this man on file in this office, and if this act becomes a law as it now reads it will be of no benefit to the heirs."
