Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I have the honor to return herewith House bill No. 4462, entitled "An act for the relief of Alexander Burtch," from which I withhold my approval for the reasons given in the accompanying letter of the Secretary of War.
U.S. GRANT.
WAR DEPARTMENT,
Washington City, January 28, 1875.
The PRESIDENT.
SIR: I have the honor to return House bill No. 4462, "for the relief of Alexander Burtch."
It appears from the records of this office that Alexander Burtch, Company H, First Indiana Artillery, enlisted July 24, 1861, for three years, reenlisted as a veteran January 1, 1864, and deserted at Fort Gaines, Ala., September 25, 1865, and was a deserter at large at date of muster out of his company, January 10, 1866.
This Department emphatically objects to this bill becoming a law upon the ground of its great injustice to every soldier who served honorably until his services were no longer required by the Government.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
WM. W. BELKNAP,
Secretary of War.
