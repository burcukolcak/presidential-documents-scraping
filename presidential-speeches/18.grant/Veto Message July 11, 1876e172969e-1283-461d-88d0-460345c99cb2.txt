Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
For the reasons set forth in the accompanying report of the Secretary of War, I have the honor to return herewith without my approval House bill No. 1337, entitled "An act for the relief of Nelson Tiffany."
U. S. GRANT.
WAR DEPARTMENT,June 7, 1876.
The PRESIDENT.
SIR: I have the honor to return House bill No. 1337, "for the relief of Nelson Tiffany."
The Adjutant-General, to whom the bill was referred, reports as follows:
"Nelson Tiffany, private, Company A, Twenty-fifth Massachusetts Volunteers deserted October 10, 1864, and remained absent until April 25, 1865, when he surrendered under the President's proclamation, thereby acknowledging his desertion.
"If this bill becomes a law, it will not only falsify the records of this Department, but will be an injustice to every man who served honorably during the War of the Rebellion."
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J.D. CAMERON,
Secretary of War.
