Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
For the reasons stated in the accompanying report by the Commissioner of Pensions to the Secretary of the Interior, I have the honor to return without my approval House bill No. 11, entitled "An act granting a pension to Eliza Jane Blumer."
U. S. GRANT.
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
Washington, July 8, 1876.
The PRESIDENT.
SIR: I have the honor to return herewith a bill (H. R. II ) entitled "An act granting a pension to Eliza Jane Blumer," and to invite your attention to the inclosed copy of a communication addressed to me on the 7th instant by the Commissioner of Pensions, relating to said bill.
In the opinion of this Department the misdescription of the soldier in the bill is of such a character as would render it difficult, if not impossible, to carry the provisions of the bill into effect should it become a law.
I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,
CHAS. T. GORHAM,
Acting Secretary.
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
Washington, D.C., July 7, 1876.
The Honorable SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.
SIR: I have the honor to return herewith engrossed House bill No. II, giving to Eliza Jane Blumer a pension as a widow of Henry A. Blumer, private of Company A, Forty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, with the suggestion that if the bill is intended to pension Eliza Blumer, whose application, No. 46382, on file in this office, has been rejected, it should designate the soldier as of Company B of said regiment, it failing to appear from the records of the War Department that he served in any other company than that last named.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. A. BENTLEY,
Commissioner.
