Veto Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I return herewith without my approval Senate bill No. 165, entitled "An act for the relief of Michael W. Brock, of Meigs County, Tenn., late a private in Company D, Tenth Tennessee Volunteers."
The objection to affixing my signature to this bill may be found in the indorsement (which accompanies this message) by the Adjutant-General of the Army.
U. S. GRANT.
WAR DEPARTMENT,
ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,
Washington, June 8, 1875.
Respectfully returned to the Secretary of War.
The records of this office show that Michael W. Brock, Company D, Tenth Tennessee Volunteers, deserted November 24, 1864, due United States for horse and horse equipments, carbine, saber, and pistol, all complete.
He presented satisfactory evidence of his having left the service by proper authority, and the charge of desertion has been removed and the soldier furnished an honorable discharge.
No evidence has been presented to this office to establish that he was erroneously charged with Government property.
If satisfactory evidence is furnished showing conclusively that this soldier was erroneously charged with Government property, taken at time of his reported desertion, the charge will be removed, and in that case the inclosed act for his relief will be unnecessary.
E. D. TOWNSEND,Adjutant General.
