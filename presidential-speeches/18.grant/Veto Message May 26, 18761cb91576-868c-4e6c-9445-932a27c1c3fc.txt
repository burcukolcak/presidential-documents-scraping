Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return herewith without my approval House bill No. 1922, entitled "An act providing for the recording of deeds, mortgages, and other conveyances affecting real estate in the District of Columbia."
The objection to affixing my signature to this bill may be found in the communication addressed to me by the Attorney-General, and which accompanies this message.
U.S. GRANT.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,
Washington, May 23, 1876.
The PRESIDENT.
SIR: In reply to your note of the 19th instant, in which you request me to report whether there are objections to your approval of "An act providing for the recording of deeds, mortgages and other conveyances affecting real estate in the District of Columbia," being House bill No. 1922, I have the honor to state that the bill seem to me objectionable because of indefiniteness and uncertainty as to the time which it purports to fix when deeds of trust, mortgages, etc., shall take effect and be valid as to creditors and subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice.
Although there is no constitutional objection to the act, yet for the reason above stated I hesitate to advise its approval.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
EDWARDS PIERREPONT,Attorney-General.
