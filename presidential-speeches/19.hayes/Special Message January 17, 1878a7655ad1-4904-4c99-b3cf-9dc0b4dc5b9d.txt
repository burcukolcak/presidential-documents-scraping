Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
In response to the resolution of the Senate of the 13th November last calling for information concerning the cause, numbers engaged, number of lives lost, and probable cost of the late so-called Nez Perce War, I have the honor to submit the accompanying communication from the General of the Army and an extract from the annual report of that officer. Upon the subject of the cost of the Nez Perce War, I submit reports from the Quartermaster-General and the Commissary-General of Subsistence.
