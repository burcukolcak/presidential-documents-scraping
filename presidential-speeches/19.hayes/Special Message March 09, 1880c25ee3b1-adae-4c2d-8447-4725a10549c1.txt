Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I have the honor to transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of the Interior containing an agreement signed by the chiefs and headmen of the Ute Indians now present at the seat of Government. The stipulations of this agreement appear to me so reasonable and just and the object to be accomplished by its execution so eminently desirable to both the white people of the United States and the Indians that it has my cordial approval, and I earnestly commend it to Congress for favorable consideration and appropriate legislative action.
RUTHERFORD B. HAYES
