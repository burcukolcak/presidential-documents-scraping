Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:
An edict of the Executive Directory of the French Republic of the 29th of October, 1798, inclosed in a letter from our minister plenipotentiary in London of the 16th of November, is of so much importance that it not be too soon communicated to you and the public.
JOHN ADAMS.
