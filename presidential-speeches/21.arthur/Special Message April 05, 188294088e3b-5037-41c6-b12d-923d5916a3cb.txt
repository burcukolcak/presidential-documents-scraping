Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of the Interior, setting forth the necessity for an increased number of law clerks in the office of the Assistant Attorney-General in the Department of the Interior, because of the growing amount of business in that office.
The matter is commended to the attention and favorable action of Congress.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
