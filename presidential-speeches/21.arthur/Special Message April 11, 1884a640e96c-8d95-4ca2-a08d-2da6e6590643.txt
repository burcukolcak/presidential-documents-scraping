Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
The condition of our seacoast defenses and their armament has been brought to the attention of Congress in my annual messages, and I now submit a special estimate of the Chief of Ordnance, United States Army, transmitted by the Secretary of War, for a permanent annual appropriation of $1,500,000 to provide the necessary armament for our fortifications.
This estimate is rounded upon the report of the Gun Foundry Board recently transmitted, to which I have heretofore invited the early attention of Congress.
In presenting this estimate I do not think it necessary to enumerate the considerations which make it of the highest importance that there should be no unnecessary delay in entering upon the work, which must be commensurate with the public interests to be guarded, and which will take much time.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
