To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of the Interior, inclosing copy of a letter addressed to him by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, asking, for reasons stated therein, that Congress may be requested to make a special appropriation for a temporary increase of the clerical force of the General Land Office. A draft of a bill for that purpose is herewith inclosed, and the subject is commended to the consideration of Congress.
