Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
Referring to my message to the Senate of the 3d instant, wherewith was transmitted, for consideration with a view to ratification, the treaty of commerce between Mexico and the United States which was signed at Washington on the 20th ultimo, I have now to inform the Senate that this Government is officially advised by that of Mexico, through its minister at this capital, that it assents to the insertion of the word "steel" in item No. (35) 66 of the list appended to article 2 of that treaty.
It is desired that the treaty be returned to me that the amendment may be made, after which it will be again sent to the Senate for final action.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
