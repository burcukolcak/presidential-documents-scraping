Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
Referring to my message to the Senate of the 25th instant, by which I transmitted, with a view to ratification, an additional article to the commercial treaty with Spain concluded November 18, 1884, I now have the honor to request the return of that instrument.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
