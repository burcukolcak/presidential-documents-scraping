Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a communication of the 2d instant from the Secretary of the Interior, inclosing certain papers in relation to the present condition of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indians in the Indian Territory, and recommending that some provision of law be enacted for disarming those and other Indians when such action may be found necessary for their advancement in civilized pursuits, and that means be provided for compensation the Indians for the weapons so taken from or surrendered by them.
The subject is commended to the favorable consideration and action of the Congress.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
