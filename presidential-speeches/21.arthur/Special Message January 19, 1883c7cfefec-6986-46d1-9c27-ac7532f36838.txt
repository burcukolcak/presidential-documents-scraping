Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I have carefully considered the provisions of Senate bill No. 561, entitled "An act for the relief of Robert Stodart Wyld."
I am of the opinion that the general statute is sufficiently liberal to provide relief in all proper cases of destroyed United States bonds, and I believe that the act above referred to constitutes an evil precedent.
It is not, however, so objectionable as to call for my formal disapproval, and I have allowed it to become a law under the constitutional provision, contenting myself with communicating to the Senate, in which the bill originated, my disapproval of special legislation of this character.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
