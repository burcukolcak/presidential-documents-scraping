Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I have carefully considered the provisions of Senate bill No. 862, entitled "An act for the relief of Uriel Crocker."
The general statute provides for relief in case of the destruction of coupon bonds.
In my opinion this provision of law is sufficiently liberal to meet all cases of missing coupon bonds worthy of favorable action, and I do not deem it advisable to encourage this class of legislation.
The bill is not, however, so flagrantly inexpedient as to call for my formal disapproval, and I have allowed it to become a law under the constitutional provision, contenting myself with communicating to the Senate, in which the bill originated, my disapproval of special legislation of this character.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
