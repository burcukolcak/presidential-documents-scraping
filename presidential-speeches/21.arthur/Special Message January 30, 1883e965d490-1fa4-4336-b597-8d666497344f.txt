Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith a copy of a communication to me from the Secretary of the Treasury.*
*Relating to the suspension of William n. Daniels, collector of customs for the district of Oswegatchie, N.Y.
I have acted in conformity with the recommendations, oral and written, which are therein set forth, concerning the action suggested to be that which would best effectuate the purpose of section 1768 of the Revised Statutes of the United States and be most considerate of the reputation and interests of the public officer to be affected and most subservient to the public interest.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
