Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to ratification, a convention between the United States and Mexico, providing for the reopening and retrying of the claims of Benjamin Weil and La Abra Silver Mining Company against Mexico, which was signed on the 13th instant.
A report of the Secretary of State, with its accompanying correspondence, transmitted to the Senate this day in response to the resolution of December 21, 1881, will show the antecedents of the negotiation which resulted in the accompanying convention. In view of the accumulation of testimony presented by Mexico relative to these two claims, I have deemed it proper to avail myself of the authority given to the Executive by the Constitution, and of which authority the act of Congress of June 18, 1878, is declarative, to effect a rehearing of these cases. I therefore empowered the Secretary of State to negotiate with the minister of Mexico a convention to that end.
The more important correspondence preliminary to the treaty is herewith transmitted.
It will be seen by the stipulations of the treaty that the rehearing will have no retroactive effect as to payments already distributed, that the bona fide interests of third parties are amply secured, and that the Government of the United States is fully guarded against any liability resulting from the rehearing.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
