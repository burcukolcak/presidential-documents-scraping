Special Message
To the House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith, for such action as is deemed proper, a communication from the Secretary of State, recommending an additional appropriation of $6,000 for the construction of a wharf and roadway as a means of approach to the monument to be erected at Wakefield, Westmoreland County, Va., to mark the birthplace of George Washington.
I commend the matter to your favorable attention.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
