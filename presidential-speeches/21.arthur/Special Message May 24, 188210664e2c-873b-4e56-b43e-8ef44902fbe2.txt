In compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 1st of March last, I transmit a communication from the Secretary of the Navy, accompanied by the report (with the exception of such parts thereof as it is deemed incompatible with the public interests to furnish) of Commodore R. W. Shufeldt, United States Navy, of his cruise around the world in the United States steamer Ticonderoga.
