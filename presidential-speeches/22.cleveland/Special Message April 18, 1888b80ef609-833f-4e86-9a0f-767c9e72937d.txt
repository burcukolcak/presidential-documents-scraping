Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
In answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 5th of March last, calling upon the Secretary of State for copies of the correspondence relating to the claim of William H. Frear against the Government of France for money due him for provisions furnished in March 1871, for revictualing Paris, I transmit a report from that officer, together with the correspondence called for by the resolution.
