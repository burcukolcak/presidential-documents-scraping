To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a communication of the 15th instant from the Secretary of the Interior, submitting, with accompanying papers upon the subject, a draft of a bill to amend section 2148 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, relating to trespasses upon Indian lands.
The subject is one of great importance, and is commended to the early and favorable action of Congress.
