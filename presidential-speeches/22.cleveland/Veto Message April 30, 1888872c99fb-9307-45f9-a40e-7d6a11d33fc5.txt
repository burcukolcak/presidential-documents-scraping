Grover Cleveland
April 30, 1888

Veto Message
To the Senate:
I return without approval Senate bill No. 838, entitled "An act granting a pension to Mary Sullivan."
On the 1st day of July, 1886, an act was approved which is an exact copy of the one herewith returned. In pursuance of that act the beneficiary's name was placed upon the pension rolls.
A second law for the same purpose is of course unnecessary.
