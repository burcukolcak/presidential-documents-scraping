To the House of Representatives:
I herewith return without approval House bill No. 8556, entitled "An act granting a pension to Abraham Points."
This soldier enlisted August 11, 1864, and was mustered out June 28, 1865.
He was treated during his short term of service for "catarrhal," "constipation," "diarrhea," "jaundice," and "colic."
He filed an application for pension in 1878, alleging that some of his comrades in a joke twisted his arm in such a manner that the elbow joint became stiffened and anchylosed, and that his eyes became sore and have continued to grow worse ever since. There is no record of either of these disabilities.
The application was denied upon the ground, as stated in the report from the Pension Bureau, that the claim "was specially examined, and it was shown conclusively, from the evidence of neighbors and acquaintances of good repute and standing, that the alleged disabilities existed at and prior to claimant's enlistment."
I am satisfied from an examination of the facts submitted to me that this determination was correct.
