Veto Message
To the Senate:
I return without approval Senate bill No. 2653, entitled "An act granting a pension to Mary Curtin."
The husband of this beneficiary was mustered into the military service October 8, 1862, was wounded in the right arm, and was discharged September 3, 1863.
He was pensioned for his wound to the time of his death, September 17, 1880.
The physician attending him in his last illness testified that the deceased was in the last stages of consumption when pneumonia intervened and caused his death.
I do not understand that this physician gives the least support to the theory that the wound for which this soldier was pensioned was in the slightest degree connected with his death, and there seems to be nothing in the case to justify the conclusion that such was the fact.
