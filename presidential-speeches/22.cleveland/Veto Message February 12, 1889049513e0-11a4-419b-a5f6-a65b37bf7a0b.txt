Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 11052, entitled "An act granting a pension to Clara M. Owen."
The husband of this beneficiary was pensioned for a gunshot wound in the left chest and lung, received in action on the 30th day of September, 1864.
He was drowned August 31, 1884.
It appears that he was found in a stream where he frequently bathed, in a depth of water variously given from 5 to 8 feet. He had undressed and apparently gone into the water as usual.
Medical opinions are produced tending to show that drowning was not the cause of death.
Nopost mortermexamination was had, and it seems to me it must be conceded that a conclusion that death was in any degree the result of wounds received in military service rests upon the most unsatisfactory conjecture.
