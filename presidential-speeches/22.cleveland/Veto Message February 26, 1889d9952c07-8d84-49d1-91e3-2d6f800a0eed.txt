Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 11586, entitled "An act for the relief of Stephen Williams."
It appears from the records that the beneficiary for whom a pension is provided in this bill served as a volunteer in an Illinois regiment from October, 1862, to October, 1864, at which date he is reported as a deserter.
He filed a claim for pension in 1881, in which he alleged that he was struck with a gunstock upon his head and injured in October, 1864.
The evidence shows that a drunken comrade struck the claimant with the stock of his gun because he would not buy whisky for him.
This, upon all the facts, does not appear to be a proper case for allowing a pension for an injury suffered in the line of military duty.
