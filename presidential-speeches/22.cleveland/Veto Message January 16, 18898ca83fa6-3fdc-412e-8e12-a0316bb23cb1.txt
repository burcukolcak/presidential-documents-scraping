Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 4887, entitled "An act granting a pension to Charles E. Scott."
This beneficiary entered the volunteer service nearly at the close of the War of the Rebellion and served from the 8th day of March, 1865, to July 24, in the same year, a period of four months and sixteen days.
He filed a claim for pension in 1884, alleging that he incurred camp itch in July, 1865, which resulted in partial blindness.
Upon the proof presented, and after examination, the claim was rejected upon the ground that it did not appear that the impairment of his vision was the result of any incident of his army service.
I am entirely satisfied that this was a correct disposition of the case, and that upon the same ground the bill herewith returned should not be approved.
