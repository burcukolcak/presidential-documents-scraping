Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 7877, entitled "An act to place Mary Karstetter on the pension roll."
The beneficiary named in this bill is the widow of Jacob Karstetter, who enlisted in June, 1864, and was discharged in June, 1865, on account of a wound in his left hand received in action. He died in August, 1874, of gastritis, or inflammation of the stomach, and congestion of the liver. He was granted a pension for his gunshot wound and was in receipt of such pension at the time of his death.
I was constrained to return without approval a bill identical with the one herewith returned, and which was passed by the last Congress, and stated my objections to the same in a communication addressed to the House of Representatives, dated July 6, 1886.
It seemed to me at that time that the soldier's death could not be held to be the result of his wound or any other cause chargeable to his military service.
Upon reexamination I am still of the same opinion, which leads me to again return the bill under consideration without approval.
