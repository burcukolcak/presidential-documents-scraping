Grover Cleveland
January 27, 1887

Veto Message
To the Senate:
I hereby return without approval Senate bill No. 2173, entitled "An act granting a pension to Benjamin Obekiah."
This bill directs that the beneficiary named therein be placed upon the pension roll, "subject to the provisions and limitations of the pension laws."
In July, 1886, the person named in this bill was placed upon the pension roll at a rate determined upon by the Pension Bureau, pursuant to the provisions and limitations of the pension laws; and it is entirely certain that the special act now presented to me would give the claimant no new rights or additional benefits.
