Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return herewith without approval House bill No. 3623, entitled "An act granting a pension to William H. Nevil."
This bill directs that the name of the claimant be placed upon the pension roll "subject to the provisions and limitations of the pension laws."
This very thing was done on the 22d day of June, 1865, and the claimant is in the receipt at the present time of the full amount of pension allowed by our pension laws as administered by the Pension Bureau.
I suppose the intention of the bill was to increase this pension, but it is not framed in such a way as to accomplish that object or to benefit the claimant in any way whatever.
