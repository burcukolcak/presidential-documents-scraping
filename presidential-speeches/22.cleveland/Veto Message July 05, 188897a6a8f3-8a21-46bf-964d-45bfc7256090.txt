Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 8291, entitled "An act granting a pension to Julia Welch."
The husband of the beneficiary named in this bill served in the Army from December, 1863, to May, 1866.
He never filed an application for pension, and died February 24, 1880 of inflammation of the lungs.
The claim filed by his widow for pension alleged that her husband suffered from chronic diarrhea and disease of the heart and lungs as results of his army service.
The claim was rejected by the Pension Bureau on the ground that the soldier died from an acute disease which bore no relation to any complaint contracted in the Army.
I think the action of the Bureau was correct.
