Grover Cleveland
July 17, 1888

Veto Message
To the Senate:
I return without approval Senate bill No. 1613, entitled "An act granting an increase of pension to John F. Ballier."
This pensioner is now receiving the full amount of pension allowed for total disability to ex-soldiers of his rank.
Inasmuch as the bill herewith returned limits any increase to the rate fixed by law for cases of total disability, it appears to accomplish nothing of benefit to the beneficiary therein named.
