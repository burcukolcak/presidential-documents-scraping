Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 5913, entitled "An act granting a pension to Thomas Shannon."
This beneficiary enlisted on the 31st day of May, 1870, in the Tenth Regiment of United States Infantry.
On the 4th day of July, 1872, he was upon leave at the city of Rio Grande, in the State of Texas. Some of the citizens were celebrating the day, and one of them had a can of powder in his hand which, according to the report of the accident, "was about to explode." The soldier endeavored to knock the can from the hand of the person who held it, when the powder exploded, severely injuring the soldier and necessitating the amputation of his right forearm.
Though this was a most unfortunate accident, it is quite plain that it had no connection with the military service.
To grant a pension in such a case would establish a precedent in the appropriation of money from the public Treasury which I can hardly think we should be justified in following.
