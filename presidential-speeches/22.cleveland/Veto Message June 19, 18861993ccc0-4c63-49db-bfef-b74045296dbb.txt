Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 4058, entitled "An act for the relief of Joel D. Monroe."
The claimant mentioned in this bill enlisted in August, 1864, and was discharged with his regiment June 4, 1865.
The record of his short military service exhibits no mention of any injury or disability; but in June, 1880, fifteen years after his discharge, he filed in the Pension Bureau a claim for a pension based upon the allegation that in December, 1864, he was injured by the falling of a tree, which struck both on his head, affecting both of his eyes. He added to this allegation the further complaint that he contracted rheumatism while in the service.
The application for a pension was rejected by the Pension Bureau because there was no record of the disabilities claimed, nor was satisfactory proof furnished that any such disabilities originated in the service.
I am so entirely satisfied with this determination of the Pension Bureau that I am constrained to withhold my approval of this bill.
