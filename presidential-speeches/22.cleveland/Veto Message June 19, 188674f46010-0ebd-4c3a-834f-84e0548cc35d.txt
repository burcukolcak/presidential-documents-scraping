Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 3826, entitled "An act for the relief of John Taylor."
By this bill it is proposed to increase the pension of the beneficiary named to $16 a month. He has been receiving a pension under the general law, dating from his discharge in 1865. His pension has been twice already increased, once by the Pension Bureau and once by a special act passed in 1882. His wound is not such as to cause his disability to become aggravated by time. The increase allowed by this bill, when applied for at the Pension Bureau in 1885, was denied on the ground that "the rate he was receiving was commensurate with the degree of his disability, a board of surgeons having reported that he was receiving a liberal rating."
I can discover no just ground for reversing this determination and making a further discrimination in favor of this pensioner.
