Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return herewith without approval House bill No. 7979, entitled "An act granting a pension to Jackson Steward."
This claimant's application for pension is now pending in the Pension Bureau, and has been sent to a special examiner for the purpose of taking additional proof.
This I deem sufficient reason why the proposed bill should not now become a law.
