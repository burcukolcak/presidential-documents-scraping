Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return herewith without approval House bill No. 6895, entitled "An act granting a pension to Sarah Harbaugh."
The husband of this claimant enlisted August 1, 1861, and was discharged September 7, 1864. He received a gunshot wound in the left ankle in May, 1863, and died suddenly of disease of the heart October 4, 1881. He was insane before his death, but in my opinion any connection between his injury and his service in the Army is next to impossible.
