Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return herewith without my approval House bill No. 7614, entitled "An act granting an increase of pension to Hezekiah Tillman."
This claimant, in his declaration for pension, filed in 1866, alleges that he received a gunshot wound in his right leg November 25, 1862. He was mustered out with his company September 22, 1864.
He was pensioned for the wound which he claimed to have received as his only injury.
In another declaration, filed in 1872, he alleged that in December, 1862, he was struck in his left eye by some hard substance, which destroyed the vision of that organ.
In a subsequent declaration, filed in 1878, he claimed that he received a shell wound in his left knee in November, 1863.
This latter claim has not been finally acted upon by the Pension Bureau, and I am of the opinion that with the diverse claims for injuries which have been there presented on behalf of the beneficiary named justice will be done in the case.
