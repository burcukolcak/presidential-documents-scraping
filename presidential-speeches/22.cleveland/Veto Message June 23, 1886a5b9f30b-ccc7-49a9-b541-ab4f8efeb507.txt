Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 7401, entitled "An act granting a pension to Samuel Miller."
This man was discharged from one enlistment June 16, 1864, and enlisted again in August of that year. He was finally discharged July 1, 1865.
In 1880 he filed an application for a pension, alleging that in May, 1862, he contracted in the service "kidney disease and weakness of the back."
A board of surgeons in 1881 reported that they failed to "discover any evidence of disease of kidneys."
It will be observed that since the date when it is claimed his disabilities visited him Mr. Miller not only served out his first term of enlistment, but reenlisted, and necessarily must have passed a medical examination.
I am entirely satisfied with the rejection of this claim by the Pension Bureau.
