Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 6257, entitled "An act for the relief of Julia Connelly."
It is proposed by this bill to grant a pension to the beneficiary named as the widow of Thomas Connelly.
This man was mustered into the service October 26, 1861. He never did a day's service so far as his name appears, and the muster-out roll of his company reports him as having deserted at Camp Cameron, Pa., November 14, 1861.
He visited his family about the 1st day of December, 1861, and was found December 30, 1861, drowned in a canal about 6 miles from his home.
Those who prosecute claims for pensions have grown very bold when cases of this description are presented for consideration.
