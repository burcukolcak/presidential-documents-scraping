Grover Cleveland
June 23, 1886

Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I herewith return without approval House bill No. 6266, entitled "An act granting a pension to Philip Arner."
It is conceded in the application for a pension made by this claimant that he was perfectly well prior to his enlistment, during his service, and for a year thereafter. He was discharged in July, 1864, and the proof is that he was taken seriously ill in the fall of 1865, since which time he has been troubled with lung difficulty.
He filed his application for pension in 1883. This was rejected on the ground that the sickness which produced his disability having occurred more than a year after his discharge from the Army, it can not be accepted as a result of his military service.
There is absolutely no allegation of any incident of his service which it is claimed is at all related to his sickness and disability.
