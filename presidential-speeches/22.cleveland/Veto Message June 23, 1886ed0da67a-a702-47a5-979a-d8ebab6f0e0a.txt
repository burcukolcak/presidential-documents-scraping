Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I herewith return without approval House bill No. 6774, entitled "An act granting a pension to Bruno Schultz."
The application of this claimant for a pension, which was filed a number of years ago, though at one time rejected, has been since opened for reexamination, and is now awaiting additional evidence.
In this condition of this case I think this bill should not be approved.
