Grover Cleveland

Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 11222, entitled "An act granting a pension to Elizabeth Heckler."
The husband of this beneficiary was pensioned for asthma, and there is no doubt of the propriety of such pension, nor is there doubt upon the evidence that this affection continued up to the time of his death.
But he died of acute inflammation of the bladder and chronic enlargement of prostate gland. There is no proof that these causes of death were in the least complicated with the difficulty for which the deceased was pensioned, or any other trouble which was the result of military service.
