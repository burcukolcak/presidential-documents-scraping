Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 4820, entitled "An act granting a pension to Ellen Kelley."
The husband of this beneficiary was granted a furlough to go home and vote on the 31st day of October, 1864. On his way there he was severely injured by a railroad collision, and there does not seem to be a particle of doubt that the injuries thus sustained caused his death.
Upon these facts this does not seem to be a proper case for the granting of a pension.
