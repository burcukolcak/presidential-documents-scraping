Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 217, entitled "An act granting a pension to C. T. Maphet."
This beneficiary enlisted August 1, 1863, and was discharged January 27, 1865, for disability.
The commander of the post certifies:
This soldier says that he was first affected with the present disease, conjunctivitis, in the spring of 1862, since which time his eyes have never been well, and for a great portion of the time since enlistment he has been unfit for duty.
The certificate of the surgeon is as follows:
Incapacitated by reason of long-standing conjunctivitis of both eyes, attended with partial opacity of the cornea. Disability existed prior to enlistment, consequently soldier is ineligible to the Veteran Reserve Corps.
The beneficiary filed no application for pension until April, 1883. Notwithstanding some evidence of soundness prior to enlistment, it seems to be quite well established that the trouble with his eyes was not the result of his military service, but existed before enlistment.
