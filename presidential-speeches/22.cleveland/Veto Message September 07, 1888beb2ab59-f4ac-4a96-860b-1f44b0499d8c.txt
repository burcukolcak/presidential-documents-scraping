Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 7717, entitled "An act granting a pension to Mrs. Catharine Reed."
The husband of this beneficiary served in the Army from July 25, 1862, to October 16, 1862, when he was discharged for disease of the lungs. He was pensioned for hernia and disease of the lungs.
On the 23d day of November, 1880, while working in a sawmill, a piece of board was thrown from a buzz saw and struck him in the groin, causing a wound from which he died two days afterwards.
It is impossible to connect this injury and the resulting death with the disability for which he was pensioned.
