Message to the Senate Returning Without Approval a Bill to Prohibit Book-making of any Kind and Pool Selling in the District of Columbia for the Purpose of Gaming
To the Senate:
I return without my approval the bill (S. 3830) "to prohibit book-making of any kind and pool selling in the District of Columbia for the purpose of gaming."
My objection to the bill is that it does not prohibit bookmaking and pool selling, but, on the contrary, expressly saves from the operation of its prohibitions and penalties the Washington Jockey Club "and any other regular organizations owning race tracks no less than 1 mile in length," etc.
If this form of gambling is to be prohibited, as I think it should be the penalties should include all persons and all places.
