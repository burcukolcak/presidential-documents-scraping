Special Message
To the Congress:
In my last annual message allusion was made to the lawless killing of certain Italian laborers in the State of Colorado, and it was added that "the dependent families of some of the unfortunate victims invite by their deplorable condition gracious provision for their needs."
It now appears that in addition to three of these laborers who were riotously killed two others, who escaped death by flight, incurred pitiable disabilities through exposure and privation.
Without discussing the question of the liability of the United States for these results, either by reason of treaty obligations or under the general rules of international law, I venture to urge upon the Congress the propriety of making from the public Treasury prompt and reasonable pecuniary provision for those injured and for the families of those who were killed.
To aid in the consideration of the subject I append hereto a report of the Secretary of State, accompanied by certain correspondence which quite fully presents all the features of the several cases.
GROVER CLEVELAND.
