Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
In response to the resolution of the Senate of December 15, 1896, relating to Cuban affairs, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State, submitting a list of the claims filed in the Department of State by citizens of the United States against Spain arising out of the insurrection existing in the island of Cuba, and the accompanying correspondence relating to the vessel called theCompetitorand the persons claiming American citizenship captured thereon, which I deem it not incompatible with the public interests to communicate.
GROVER CLEVELAND.
