Grover Cleveland
January 27, 1896

Special Message
To the House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with copies of all correspondence of record relating to the failure of the scheme for the colonization of negroes in Mexico, necessitating their return to their home in Alabama.
I referred to this matter in my message to Congress at the beginning of the present session, and for the reasons then given I again urge the propriety of making an appropriation to cover the cost of transportation furnished by the railroad companies.
GROVER CLEVELAND.
