Grover Cleveland
March 09, 1893

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
For the purpose of reexamination I withdraw the treaty of annexation between the United States and the Provisional Government of the Hawaiian Islands, now pending in the Senate, which was signed February 14, 1893, and transmitted to the Senate on the 15th of the same month, and I therefore request that said treaty be returned to me.
GROVER CLEVELAND.
