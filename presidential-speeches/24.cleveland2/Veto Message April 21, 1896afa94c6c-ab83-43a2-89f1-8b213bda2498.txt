Grover Cleveland
April 21, 1896

Veto Message
To the Senate:
I return herewith without my approval Senate bill No. 249, entitled "An act granting a pension to Charles E. Jones."
The beneficiary named in this bill was a photographer who accompanied one of the regiments of the Union Army in the War of the Rebellion. He was injured, apparently not very seriously, while taking photographs and when no battle was in actual progress. He was not enlisted, and was in no manner in the military service of the United States.
Aside from the question as to whether his present sad condition is attributable to the injury mentioned, it seems to me the extension of pension relief to such cases would open the door to legislation hard to justify and impossible to restrain from abuse.
GROVER CLEVELAND.
