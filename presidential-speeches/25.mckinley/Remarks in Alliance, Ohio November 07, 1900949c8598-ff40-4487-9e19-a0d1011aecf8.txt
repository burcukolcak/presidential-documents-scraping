Remarks in Alliance, Ohio
My fellow-citizens: 1 have not failed to observe the vote of Alliance yesterday, and I cannot refrain from expressing to you in public my very great appreciation of this vote of encouragement and support from my old friends and neighbors of Start County. [Great applause]
I observe that majorities rise with prosperity [great applause] and that the American people never fail to support the flag. [Applause] 1 thank you and bid you good afternoon. [Tremendous applause and cheering]
