Remarks in Nashua, New Hampshire
I am glad to have the chance to be greeted by you this morning, and to acknowledge from my heart your greeting. This is one of the industrial centres the prosperity of which has meant the prosperity of the whole country. The great feature of the material growth of this country during the last fifty years, aside from our expansion westward across the continent to the Pacific, has been the extraordinary industrial progress which has built up such cities as this in which I am now speaking.
We are living in an era of great prosperity. Your city has had its full share of that prosperity, but prosperity by itself never made any man happy. You are not going to be happy without it, but you are not going be happy if you do not have something else besides. Prosperity must be the basis. The material well being must be the foundation, but on it you have to rear a superstructure of kindly brotherhood, all striving for decency in public and private life, or but scant will be the good of prosperity.
