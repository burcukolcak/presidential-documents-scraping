Special Message
To the Senate:
I transmit herewith a report from the Acting Secretary of State, with accompanying papers, in response to the Senate's resolution of June 30, 1902, requesting the Secretary of State "to send to the Senate a statement of the expenditures of the Isthmian Canal Commission, under the act approved March 3, 1899, 'making appropriations for the construction, repair, and preservation of certain public works on rivers and harbors, and for other purposes,' as the same are accounted for by said Isthmian Canal Commission, and also whether there is any deficit in the appropriation which is to be or has been provided for by further appropriations."
