Special Message
To the Congress:
I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State in regard to the killing, on July 11, 1901, by an armed mob, at Erwin, Miss., of Giovanni and Vincenzo Serio, and the wounding by the same mob of Salvatore Liberto, all subjects of the King of Italy, and recommend that, as an act of grace and without reference to the question of the liability of the United States, Congress make suitable provision for the heirs of the two Italian subjects killed and for the survivor, Salvatore Liberto, who was injured, the proceeds to be distributed by the Italian Government in such manner as it may deem proper.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
