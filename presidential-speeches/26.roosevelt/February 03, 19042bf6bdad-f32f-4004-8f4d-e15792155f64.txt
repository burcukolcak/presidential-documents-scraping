Theodore Roosevelt
February 03, 1904

Special Message
To the Senate:
In response to the resolution of the Senate of January 22, 1904, I transmit herewith reports from the Acting Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Navy, with accompanying papers.
The correspondence since November 16, 1902, referred to in the letter of the Secretary of the Navy, which has not already been transmitted to the Senate, has no reference to the matters covered by the resolution and deals with military movements, and it is for that reason deemed incompatible with the public interest to make it public at this time.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
