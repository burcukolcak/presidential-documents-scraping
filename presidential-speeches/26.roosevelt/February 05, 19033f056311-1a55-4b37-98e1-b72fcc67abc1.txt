Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return herewith, without approval, Senate bill 1115, entitled "An act providing for additional terms of court in the western judicial district of the State of South Carolina."
The Attorney-General reports that the establishment of the two additional places for holding court in the western judicial district of South Carolina at Spartanburg and Rockhill would be accompanied by considerable expense, which would be hardly justifiable, as the necessity is at least very doubtful.
In response to requests for their views on the subject, the judges of the circuit and district courts in this district also report that there is no necessity for and that the public business does not require such additional terms.
In view of these statements, I am constrained to withhold my approval of the bill.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
