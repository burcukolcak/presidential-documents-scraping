Veto Message
To the Senate:
I return herewith Senate bill No. 4308, entitled "An act for the relief of Katie A. Nolan."
Executive approval of this bill is withheld for the reason that it appears to be a duplication of legislation. The deficiency act of July 1, 1902, contained the following provision:
"To enable the Postmaster-General to pay Katie A. Nolan balance of salary due her as stamp clerk in the post-office at San Antonio, Tex., from July 1, 1889, to July 1, 1893, $800."
Under this provision of said act Katie A. Nolan, the beneficiary named in this bill, was paid $800 by the postmaster at San Antonio, Tex., by direction of the Postmaster-General, as shown by the records of the Post-Office Department.
