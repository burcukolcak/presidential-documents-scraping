Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a report on the condition and needs of the natives of Alaska, made by Lieut. G. T. Emmons, United States Navy, retired.
Lieutenant Emmons had for many years peculiar facilities for ascertaining the facts about the natives of Alaska and has recently concluded an investigation made on the ground by my special direction. I very earnestly ask the attention of the Congress to the facts set forth in this report as to the needs of the native people of Alaska. It seems to me that our honor as a nation is involved in seeing that these needs are met. I earnestly hope that legislation along the general lines advocated by Lieutenant Emmons can be enacted.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
