Theodore Roosevelt
January 27, 1904

Special Message
To the Senate:
In response to the resolution of the Senate of January 18, 1904, requesting the President, "if not in his opinion incompatible with the public interest, to inform the Senate whether any report has been made to the Treasury Department by L. Cullom, special agent of the Treasury, with respect to the conduct of A. R. Cruzen, collector of customs in Porto Rico, and if so, to transmit the same to the Senate with a statement of what action, if any, has been taken thereon," I send herewith the accompanying letter from the Secretary of the Treasury. For the reasons therein given I deem it incompatible with the public interest to forward the report by the special agent of the Treasury in question.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
