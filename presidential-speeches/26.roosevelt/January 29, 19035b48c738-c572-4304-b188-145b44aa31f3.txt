Referring to Senate Document No. 264, Fifty-seventh Congress, first session, I transmit herewith a report by the Secretary of State, with accompanying papers, in the claim of Messrs. George A. Tarler & Co. against the Government of Colombia, which were inadvertently omitted from the papers sent to the Senate on March 20, 1902, in response to the Senate's resolution of March 15, 1900.
