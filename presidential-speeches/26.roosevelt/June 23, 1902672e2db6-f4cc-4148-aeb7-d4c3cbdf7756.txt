Message to Congress
To the Senate:
I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with accompanying papers, in further response to the Senate's resolution of May 15, 1900, requesting copies of all correspondence and papers in regard to claims of citizens of the United States against the Government of Colombia growing out of the withdrawal of the military forces and police from Colon by that Government and the firing of the city by insurgents in 1885.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
