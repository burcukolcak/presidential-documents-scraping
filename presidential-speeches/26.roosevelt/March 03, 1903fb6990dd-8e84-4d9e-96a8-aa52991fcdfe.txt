Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 9632, entitled "An act for the allowance of claims of certain citizens of Virginia for damages to their property incident to the encampment at Manassas and march from Camp Alger to Thoroughfare Gap, Virginia, as recommended by a board of officers appointed for the consideration of claims for damages to property by volunteer soldiers during the war with Spain," with a view to having it reconsidered and amended. Attention is invited to the accompanying letter and statement of the Quartermaster-General of the Army.
