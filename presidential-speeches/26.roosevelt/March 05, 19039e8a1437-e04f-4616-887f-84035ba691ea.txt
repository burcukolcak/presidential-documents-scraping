Theodore Roosevelt
March 05, 1903

Special Message
To the Senate:
I have called the Senate in extraordinary session to consider the treaties concerning which it proved impossible to take action during the session of Congress just ended. I ask your special attention to the treaty with the Republic of Colombia, securing to the United States the right to build an isthmian canal, and to the treaty with the Republic of Cuba, for securing a measure of commercial reciprocity between the two countries.
The great and far-reaching importance of these two treaties to the welfare of the United States and the urgent need for their adoption require me to impose upon you the inconvenience of meeting at this time.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
