Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I submit herewith the preliminary report of the Public Lands Commission appointed by me October 22, 1903, to report upon the condition, operation, and effect of the present land laws, and to recommend such changes as are needed to effect the largest practicable disposition of the public lands to actual settlers who will build permanent homes upon them, and to secure in permanence the fullest and most effective use of the resources of the public lands. The subject is one of such great importance and great intricacy that it is impossible for the Commission to report in full thereon at this time. It is now ready, however, to suggest certain changes in the law as set forth in the accompanying report. I commend these suggestions to the favorable consideration of the Congress.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
