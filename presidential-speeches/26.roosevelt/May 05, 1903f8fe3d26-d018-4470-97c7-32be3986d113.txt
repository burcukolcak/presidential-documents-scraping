Remarks at the Catholic School in Albuquerque, New Mexico
Bishop:
Permit me to thank you and to say how much I appreciate the courtesy you showed in putting yourself to such inconvenience to come here to greet me. I had hoped to meet you at Santa Fe, in the cathedral, where I participated in the baptism of the son of one of the men of my regiment.
I greet the school children and the sisters. There can be no greater privilege than to meet a missionary who has done good work. Of all the work that is done or that can be done for our country, the greatest is that of educating the body, the mind, and above all the character, giving spiritual and moral training to those who in a few years are themselves to decide the destines of the Nation.
