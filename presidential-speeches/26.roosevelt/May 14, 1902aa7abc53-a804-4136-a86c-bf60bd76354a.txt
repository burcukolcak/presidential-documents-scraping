Remarks at the Laying of the Cornerstone of the McKinley Memorial Ohio College of Government of the American University
Ladies and gentlemen:
I am to say but one word. Nothing more need be said than has been said already by those who have addressed you this afternoon the statesmen who worked with McKinley and the pastor under whose ministrations he sat.
It is indeed appropriate that the Methodists of America—the men belonging to that religious organization which furnished the pioneers in carving out of the West what is now the heart of the great American Republic—should found this great university in the city of Washington and should build the college that is to teach the science of government in the name of the great exponent of good and strong government who died last fall, who died as truly for this country as Abraham Lincoln himself.
I thank you for having given me the opportunity this afternoon to come before you and to lay the corner-stone of this building.
