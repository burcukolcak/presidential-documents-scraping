Remarks at Colfax, California
My Fellow-Citizens, My Fellow-Americans [applause], Men and Women of Placer County:
It is the greatest pleasure to have caught even a glimpse of the miners here. I do not have to preach to you. You practice what I preach, and I hope I do myself, too. [Laughter] You in your lives here have done the things which it makes all of us proud as Americans to have done. We do not believe here in this republic in the men who seek only the life of ease, the life of absence of effort. We believe in the men who face toil, who face risk, who dare, who do and who triumph because they have done it. [Cheers and applause]
