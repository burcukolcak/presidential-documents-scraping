Remarks in Hornbrook, California
My friends and fellow citizens:
I have just said good-bye to the Governor of California, and I am very, very sorry to part with him. He has been with me throughout my trip in California, and I have gone pretty fairly over the State with him. Today I have been traveling through the northern part of California, among the mountains and the forests, and it has given me an ever fresh view of your wonderful and beautiful State. As I have said more than once since entering your State, I knew as one knows by reading and by hearing people talk of all the resources that it had, but I could not fully realize them until I had seen them. Going through California, I have been struck with the prosperous and contented look of its people, and of course you are contented; I should be ashamed of you if you were not, living in such a state as this. And glad though I have been to see your soil and climate, to see your products, the products of your fields, and mines and woods, what you have done with railroads, with transportation companies on the water, with factories, with industries of every kind, what I have been most pleased with after all has been the way in which you are training the citizenship of the future, the attention paid to the schools of every grade here in this State; and above all with the type of men and women and children whom it has been my good fortune to encounter. The essential thing in any State is the character of the average man or woman, and I am proud to be your fellow-citizen, and to have men the type of people I have met in California.
