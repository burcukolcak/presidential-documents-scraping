Remarks in Manassas, Virginia
Ladies and gentlemen:
I wish to thank you very much for the way you have come to greet me. I have thoroughly enjoyed my day here. I regret to state that the turkeys did not materialize. In the first place I had a good walk. It is the first I have had for six weeks, and I appreciated it. I was delighted to have a chance to visit the great battle-fields here; and it is a very pleasant thing for any man who has the least desire to be a good American to come through your historic town and to see the two avenues named in memory of Grant and Lee. I feel that all of us in any part of this country now have an equal right to glory in the valor and the devotion to duty, as each saw his duty, alike of those who wore the blue and those who wore the gray. I thank you for having greeted me.
