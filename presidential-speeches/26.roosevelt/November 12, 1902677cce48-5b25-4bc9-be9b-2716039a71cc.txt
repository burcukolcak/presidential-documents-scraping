Remarks in Dennison, Ohio
Gentlemen and ladies:
I want to thank you very much for coming here to greet me, and to say that I appreciate it. I only wish that I was not always afraid of some accident happening to the small folks. You know the problem of the little apples in the middle of the barrel. The little folks are just like that—always come in the middle.
I shall not try to make a speech to you. I am going South to meet at Memphis a man—General Luke Wright—who has done distinguished service in the Philippines; and I am going to take four or five days holiday first.
It is a great pleasure to come here in your beautiful State; to have passed through Pennsylvania, as I just have. I have not merely the hope, but the belief, that our people, as a whole, will so handle themselves that the good times we are enjoying may be continued; that we shall be careful not to mar them by foolish action, and at the same time will have the forethought to cut out any evil that hampers the development of the good.
