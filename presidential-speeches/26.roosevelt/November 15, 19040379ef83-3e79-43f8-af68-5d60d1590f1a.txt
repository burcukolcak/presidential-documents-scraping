Remarks in Response to Address of Prince Fushimi of Japan at the White House
It gives me unfeigned pleasure to meet your Imperial Highness and to hear from you the expressions of the friendly sentiments of His Majesty the Emperor and of the people of Japan toward the United States of America. I assure you that these sentiments are warmly reciprocated by me and by the American people.
Ever since the Empire of Japanâ€”at the invitation of this country, entered upon the career of modern and international progress which has led to such brilliant results, the relations of the two countries have been that of unbroken friendship. I pray that those relations may continue forever, growing always more friendly and more extended, and I trust that this visit of your Imperial Highness may result in that increase of good will between this Republic and the Empire of Japan which will naturally come from more intimate acquaintance and wider knowledge of each other.
I beg you to convey to His Majesty the Emperor my grateful appreciation of his valued expressions of amity and my best wishes for his health and happiness, and the prosperity of the Japanese people.
