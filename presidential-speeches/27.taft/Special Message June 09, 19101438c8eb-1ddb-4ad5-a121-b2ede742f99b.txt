Special Message
To the House of Representatives:
In response to the resolution of the House of Representatives of April 20, 1910, relative to the recent tariff negotiations between the Government of the United States and foreign governments made necessary by the tariff act of August 5, 1909, I transmit herewith reports by the Secretary of State, with accompanying papers, and the Secretary of the Treasury.
WILLIAM H. TAFT
Note: The tariff negotiations mentioned by President Taft resulted, according to the Secretary of State, in the application to American products by Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium of their minimum rates; in the general though not complete application by France of its minimum rates, though previously the maximum had been applied; and in the conclusion of tariff-lowering agreements with Greece, Servia, Bulgaria, Roumania, Brazil and Canada.
