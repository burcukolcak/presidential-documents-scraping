Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith, for the information of the Congress, a report of the International Waterways Commission, dated January 8, 1910, on the regulation of Lake Erie, together with the appendix, tables, and plates.
WILLIAM H. TAFT
Note: This Message was accompanied by a report from the International Waterways Commission on the proposed erection at or near Buffalo of a submerged weir and sluice gates to regulate the depth of Lake Erie by controlling the outflow. The Report concluded as follows :--
"The advantages of regulating Lake Erie are that the low-water stages of Lake Erie will be raised about 1 foot; that of Lake St. Clair will be raised about 0.61 foot; and that of Lake Michigan-Huron about 0.27 foot, without in any case increasing the high-water stage. The disadvantages are that the oscillations in Lake Ontario are increased about 5 1/2 inches, and low water is made lower by about 4Â½ inches; that the depth in the St. Lawrence canals will be diminished by about 7.66 inches; that the city of Buffalo and its southerly suburbs will suffer by increased damage from floods, and from a postponement of the date of opening navigation in the spring. In weighing these advantages and disadvantages, it is to be remembered that the persons who are to benefit by the former are not identical with those who are to suffer from the latter. As the matter stands it involves the question of damages to vested rights, which in this case is peculiarly intricate. It is our opinion that the advantages are not of such overwhelming character as to justify the two governments in entering upon that vexatious question, and we therefore recommend that the "regulation" of Lake Erie be not undertaken, meaning thereby the most complete practicable regulation such as can be secured by a dam and sluice gates located at or near Buffalo."
