Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I lay before the Congress herewith a report submitted by the commission which visited Liberia in pursuance of the provisions of the deficiency act of March 4, 1909, "to investigate the interests of the United States and its citizens in the Republic of Liberia, with the consent of the authorities of said Republic."
This report is accompanied by a communication of the Secretary of State reciting the conditions under which the Liberian commonwealth was founded through the efforts of the Government of the United States and American citizens, and commenting on the recommendations of the commission touching the course to be pursued by this Government in aid of Liberia at this juncture of stress and need. I cordially concur in the views of the Secretary of State and trust that the policy of the United States toward Liberia will be so shaped as to fulfill our national duty to the Liberian people who, by the efforts of this Government and through the material enterprise of American citizens, were established on the African coast and set on the pathway to sovereign statehood.
WILLIAM H. TAFT
Note: This Message was accompanied by a letter from the Secretary of State in which, regarding the report of the Liberian Commission, he made the following recommendations:--
(1) That, in view of the inability of Liberia to cope with foreign powers in boundary disputes, that the United States secure by treaty power of attorney to represent the Republic in international matters.
(2) That a system of internal revenue administration similar to that in force at Santo Domingo be established and that the agencies controlling same be also given power over the internal finances of the Republic.
(3) That, as a vital concomitant of any real settlement of boundary questions the United States aid Liberia to drill and organize an adequate constabulary.
(4) That the United States maintain a research station to advise Liberia as to agriculture and other resources and as to hygiene and sanitation.
(5) That the United States establish a coaling station in Liberia.
