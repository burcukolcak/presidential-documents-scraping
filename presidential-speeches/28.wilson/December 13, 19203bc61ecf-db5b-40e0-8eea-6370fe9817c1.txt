Written Address to the Nation on Relief of Starving Children in Europe
The White House,December 13, 1920.
Three and a half million children are facing starvation in Central Europe. It is estimated that they can be tided over to the next harvest
by money and service equivalent to thirty dollars per child. The countries involved can furnish two-thirds of this cost in the form of personnel and machinery for distribution, but for the other one-third they must look abroad, and they are looking to us.
Since 1914 our people have given with unparalleled generosity, and they should not be lightly called upon for additional charities. But there is a life-and-death situation in Central Europe, where orphaned, destitute, famished children, pitiful consequences of the World War, must die unless aid is sent.
Ten dollars contributed through the European Relief Council will save the life of one child. For concerted effort, there have been combined in this council eight well-known organizations, namely the American Relief Administration, American Red Cross, American Friends' Service Committee, Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, Knights of Columbus, Y.M.C.A., and Y.W.C.A.
At Christmas time, peculiarly the children's season, we should think of this sad European problem in terms of children rather than in terms of money. Ten dollars will represent a child's life in Central Europe. I shall adopt twenty of these children as my own temporary wards, and I can think of no better use to which I could put two hundred dollars.
I suggest to my fellow-countrymen that the circles around their Christmas trees will be incomplete unless, mingled with their own expectant children, they shall visualize some of the waifs of Central Europe, stretching out their thin hands to pluck from the boughs of the trees, not toys, but bread without which they must perish.
