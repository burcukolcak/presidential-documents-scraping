Remarks at Dover, England
Mr. Mayor:
You have certainly extended to me and to those who are accompanying me a very cordial and gracious hand of welcome. Even the sea was kind to us this morning and gave us a very pleasant passage, so that it tallied perfectly with our expectations of the pleasure we should have in landing in England.
We have gone through many serious times together, and therefore we can regard each other in a new light as comrades and associates, because nothing brings men together like a common understanding and a common purpose. I think that in spite of all the terrible sufferings and sacrifices of this war we shall some day in looking back upon them realize that they were worth while, not only because of the security they gave the world against unjust aggression, but also because of the understanding they established between great nations which ought to act with each other in the permanent maintenance of justice and of right. It is, therefore, with emotions of peculiar gratification that I find myself here. It affords the opportunity to match my mind with the minds of those who with a like intention are purposing to do the best that can be done in the great settlements of the struggle.
I thank you very warmly, gentlemen, for your greeting and beg to extend to you in the name of my own countrymen the most cordial greetings.
APP Note: The President was greeted by Dover Mayor Edwin Farley.
