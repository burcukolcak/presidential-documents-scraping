Remarks to the League of Nations Union at the American Embassy in London, England
Gentlemen:
I am very much complimented that you should come in person to present this address, and I have been delighted and stimulated to find the growing and prevailing interest in the subject of the league of nations, not only a growing interest merely, but a growing purpose which I am sure will prevail. And it is very delightful that members of the Government which brought this nation into the war because of the moral obligations based upon treaty should be among those who have brought me this paper, because on the other side of the water we have greatly admired the motives and subscribed to the principles which actuated the Government of Great Britain. In obeying that moral dictate you have shown what we must organize, namely, that same force and sense of obligation, and unless we organize it the thing that we do now will not stand. I feel that so strongly that it is particularly cheering to know just how strong and imperative the idea has become.
I thank you very much indeed. It has been a privilege to see you personally.
I was just saying to Lord Grey that we had indirect knowledge of each other and that I am glad to identify him. I feel as if I met him long ago; and I had the pleasure of matching minds with Mr. Asquith yesterday.
APP Note: The President referred to Sir Edward Grey, who had been British Foreign Secretary under the Liberal government headed by H. H. Asquith from 1908- 1916;
