Remarks on the Balcony of La Scala in Milan, Italy
I wish I could take you all to some place where a similar body of my fellow countrymen could show you their heart toward you as you have shown me your heart toward them, because the heart of America has gone out to the heart of Italy. We have been watchful of your heroic struggle and of your heroic suffering. And it has been our joy in these recent days to be associated with you in the victory which has liberated Italy and liberated the world. Viva Italia!
