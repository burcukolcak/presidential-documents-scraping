Executive Order 1997â€”Amending the Civil Service Rules Providing for the Appointment of Aliens When No Citizens Are Available
Section 1 of Rule V is hereby amended by adding thereto the following proviso:
Provided, That when an examination has been duly announced to fill a vacancy and there is a lack of eligibles who are citizens, the Commission may, in its discretion, examine persons who are not citizens, but they shall not be certified for appointment so long as citizens are eligible.
As amended this section will read:
1. No person shall be admitted to examination unless he be a citizen of or owe allegiance to the United States: Provided, That when an examination has been duly announced to fill a vacancy and there is a lack of eligibles who are citizens, the Commission may, in its discretion, examine persons who are not citizens, but they shall not be certified for appointment so long as citizens are eligible.
This order merely transfers to the civil service rules a provision of an Executive order of June 13, 1906.
