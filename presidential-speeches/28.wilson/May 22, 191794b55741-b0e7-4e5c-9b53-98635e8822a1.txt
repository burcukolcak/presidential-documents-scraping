Executive Order 2626â€”Reinstating Certain Persons Formerly in the Competitive Service
Civil Service Rule IX is hereby amended by numbering the present rule as a paragraph and adding the following paragraph:
2. A person resigning a scientific, professional, or technical position in the competitive service in which he has acquired training and experience not to be acquired elsewhere, to enter the public service of a State, county, municipality, or foreign government in a similar capacity, may immediately upon the completion of such service be reinstated in the Department in which he formerly served, upon the certificate of the Commission issued upon the requisition of the Department dated within three years from the date of his separation from the competitive service.
As amended the rule will read:

(b) No person may be reinstated to a position requiring an examination different from that required for the position from which he was separated without passing an appropriate examination. 2. A person resigning a scientific, professional, or technical position in the competitive service in which he has acquired training and experience not to be acquired elsewhere, to enter the public service of a State, county, municipality, or foreign government in a similar capacity, may immediately upon the completion of such service be reinstated in the Department in which he formerly served, upon the certificate of the Commission issued upon the requisition of the Department dated within three years from the date of his separation from the competitive service.
