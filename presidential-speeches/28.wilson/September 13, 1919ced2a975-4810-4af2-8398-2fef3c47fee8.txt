Address at the Stadium Bowl in Tacoma, Washington
My friends and fellow citizens, it is very delightful to find myself in this beautiful spot and very thrilling to find myself surrounded by so great a company of my fellow citizens. I can not in these circumstances make you a speech, but I can say something from my heart. I can say that I am profoundly glad to see you and profoundly touched by a welcome like this. I want to express my particular interest in this charming circle of school children, because one of the thoughts that has been most in my mind recently is that we are making decisions now which will mean more to the children than they mean to us and that as we care for the future generations we will be careful to make the right decisions as to the policy of the United States as one of the factors in the peace of the world. I give you my most cordial greeting and my most profound thanks for this generous welcome.
