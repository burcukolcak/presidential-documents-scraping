By virtue of the authority vested in me, I hereby establish the following order for the Canal Zone:
Section 1. Paragraph E of Section 12, of the Executive Order of March 20, 1914, relating to injury compensation to be paid to employees of The Panama Canal, and the Panama Railroad Company, is hereby amended to read as follows:
(E) If the deceased employee leaves a parent, either partially or wholly dependent on him for support; or a brother, sister, grand-parent or grand-child, wholly dependent on him for support, there may be paid to such relation monthly such portion or portions of the monthly pay of the employee as may be determined by the Governor of The Panama Canal, provided that the total compensation to all beneficiaries under this and paragraphs A, B, C and D of this section shall not exceed fifty per cent of the monthly pay of the deceased employee, and provided, that in order to make payment to the relatives under this paragraph, the Governor of The Panama Canal may, if necessary, reduce the proportion payable to widow or children under paragraphs A, B, C and D of this section, and, provided further, that payment for the benefit of a relative under this paragraph shall cease if he dies, marries, or, in the opinion of the Governor, becomes capable of selfsupport, but in no case shall payment continue more than eight years.
This amendment shall be effective from the date the order of March 20, 1914, became effective, viz.: April 1, 1914.
