Message to the Senate Transmitting the Louisiana Purchase Treaty
Gentlemen of the Senate:
In mymessage of this dayto both Houses of Congress I explained the circumstances which had led to the conclusion of conventions with France for the cession of the Province of Louisiana to the United States. Those conventions are now laid before you with such communications relating to them as may assist in deciding whether you will advise and consent to their ratification.
The ratification of the First Consul of France is in the hands of his charge d'affaires here, to be exchanged for that of the United States whensoever, before the 30th instant, it shall be in readiness.
TH: JEFFERSON.
