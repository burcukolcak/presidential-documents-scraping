Thomas Jefferson
April 11, 1806

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I now lay before Congress a statement of the militia of the United States according to the returns last received from the several States and Territories. It will be perceived that some of these are not of recent dates, and that from the States of Maryland and Delaware no returns are stated. As far as appears from our records, none were ever rendered from either of these States. From the Territories of Orleans, Louisiana, and Michigan complete returns have not yet been received.
TH: JEFFERSON.
