Thomas Jefferson
December 11, 1801

Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate:
Early in the last month I received the ratification by the First Consul of France of the convention between the United States and that nation. His ratification not being pure and simple in the ordinary form, I have thought it my duty, in order to avoid all misconception, to ask a second advice and consent of the Senate before I give it the last sanction by pro-claiming it to be a law of the land.
TH: JEFFERSON.
