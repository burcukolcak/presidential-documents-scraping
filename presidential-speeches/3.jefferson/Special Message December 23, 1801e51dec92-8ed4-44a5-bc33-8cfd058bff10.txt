Thomas Jefferson
December 23, 1801

Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
Another return of the census of the State of Maryland is just received from the marshal of that State, which he desires may be substituted as more correct than the one first returned by him and communicated by me to Congress. This new return, with his letter, is now laid before you.
TH: JEFFERSON.
