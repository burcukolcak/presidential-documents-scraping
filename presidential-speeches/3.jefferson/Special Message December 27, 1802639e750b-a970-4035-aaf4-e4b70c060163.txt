Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate:
I lay before you a treaty, which has been concluded between the State of New York and the Oneida Indians, for the purchase of lands within that State.
One other, between the same State and the Seneca Indians, for the purchase of other lands within the same State.
One other, between certain individuals styled the Holland Company with the Senecas, for the exchange of certain lands in the same State.
And one other, between Oliver Phelps, a citizen of the United States, and the Senecas, for the exchange of lands in the same State; with sundry explanatory papers, all of them conducted under the superintendence of a commissioner on the part of the United States, who reports that they have been adjusted with the fair and free consent and understanding of the parties. It is therefore submitted to your determination whether you will advise and consent to their respective ratifications.
TH: JEFFERSON.
