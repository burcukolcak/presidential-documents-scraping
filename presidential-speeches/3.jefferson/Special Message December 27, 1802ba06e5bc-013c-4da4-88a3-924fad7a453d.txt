Thomas Jefferson
December 27, 1802

Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
In my message of the 15th instant I mentioned that plans and estimates of a dry dock for the preservation of our ships of war, prepared by a person of skill and experience, should be laid before you without delay. These are now transmitted, the report and estimates by duplicates; but the plans being single only, I must request an intercommunication of them between the Houses and their return when they shall no longer be wanting for their consideration.
TH: JEFFERSON.
