Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
In the course of the last year the following treaties and conventions for the extinguishment of Indian title to lands within our limits were entered into on behalf of the United States:
A treaty between the United States and the Wyandot, Ottawa, Chippeway, Munsee and Delaware, Shawanee and Pottawatamy nations of Indians.
A treaty between the United States and the agents of the Connecticut Land Company on one part and the Wyandot and Ottawa, Chippeway, Munsey and Delaware, Shawanee and Pottawatamy nations of Indians.
A treaty between the United States and the Delawares, Pottawatamies, Miamis, Eel-rivers, and Weas.
A treaty between the United States and the Chickasaw Nation of Indians.
Two treaties between the United States and the Cherokee Indians.
A convention between the United States and the Creek Nation of Indians.
The Senate having advised and consented to the ratification of these several treaties and conventions, I now lay them before both Houses of Congress for the exercise of their constitutional powers as to the means of fulfilling them.
TH: JEFFERSON.
