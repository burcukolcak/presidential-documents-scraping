Thomas Jefferson
February 25, 1802

Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
No occasion having arisen since the last account rendered by my predecessor of making use of any part of the moneys heretofore granted to defray the contingent charges of the Government, I now transmit to Congress an official statement thereof to the 31st day of December last, when the whole unexpended balance, amounting to $20,911.80, was carried to the credit of the surplus fund, as provided for by law, and this account consequently becomes finally closed.
TH: JEFFERSON.
