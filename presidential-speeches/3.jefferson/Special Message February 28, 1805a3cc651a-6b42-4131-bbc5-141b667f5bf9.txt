Thomas Jefferson
February 28, 1805

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I now render to Congress the account of the fund established by the act of May 1, 1802, for defraying the contingent charges of Government. No occasion having arisen for making use of any part of the balance of $18,560 unexpended on the 31st day of December, 1803, when the last account was rendered by message, that balance has been carried to the credit of the surplus fund.
TH: JEFFERSON.
