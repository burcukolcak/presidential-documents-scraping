Thomas Jefferson
January 29, 1806

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
Having received from sundry merchants at Baltimore a memorial on the same subject with those I communicated to Congress with my message of the 17th instant, I now communicate this also as a proper sequel to the former, and as making a part of the mass of evidence of the violations of our rights on the ocean.
TH: JEFFERSON.
