Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
According to the request of the Senate of yesterday, I now transmit the five printed memorials of the agent for the shipNew Jersey,in the one of which marked B, at the ninth page, will be found the letter relative to it from the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris to the French minister of the treasury, supposed to be the one designated in the resolution. We have no information of this letter but through the channel of the party interested in the ship, nor any proof of it more authentic than that now communicated.
TH: JEFFERSON.
