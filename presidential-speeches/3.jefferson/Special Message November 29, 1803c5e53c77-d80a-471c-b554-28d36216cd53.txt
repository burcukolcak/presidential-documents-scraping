Thomas Jefferson
November 29, 1803

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I now communicate an appendix to the information heretofore given on the subject of Louisiana. You will be sensible, from the face of these papers, as well as of those to which they are a sequel, that they are not and could not be official, but are furnished by different individuals as the result of the best inquiries they had been able to make, and now given as received from them, only digested under heads to prevent repetitions.
TH: JEFFERSON.
