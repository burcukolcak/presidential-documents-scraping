Special Message to Congress on the Wreck of the U.S.S. Philadelphia in Tripoli
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I communicate to Congress a letter received from Captain Bainbridge, commander of thePhiladelphiafrigate, informing us of the wreck of that vessel on the coast of Tripoli, and that himself, his officers and men, had fallen into the hands of the Tripolitans. This accident renders it expedient to increase our force and enlarge our expenses in the Mediterranean beyond what the last appropriation for the naval service contemplated. I recommend, therefore, to the consideration of Congress such an addition to that appropriation as they may think the exigency requires.
TH: JEFFERSON.
