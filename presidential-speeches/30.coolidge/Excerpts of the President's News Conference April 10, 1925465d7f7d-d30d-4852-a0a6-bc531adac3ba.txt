Excerpts of the President's News Conference
Here is an interesting suggestion that there isn't very much on the horizon and would like to have me give some suggestions about news. I don't know what I can do about that. I want to help everyone I can. That inquiry about Secretary Weeks suggests to me that if you wanted to dig up a newspaper story about newspaper stories that have been published and didn't prove to be true, it makes quite a long story. Since I have been President three members of my Cabinet have resigned and one has died. I don't know how many of them the newspapers have resigned for me and how many reports have come that they were about to resign or had resigned. Perhaps some of you that have enterprise and enjoy research would like to look over that list and write a newspaper story about it, if you are short of some kind of copy.
I am glad to have any questions asked about anything. I don't want anybody to hesitate about asking questions. That is what I meant by my suggestion, I think at the last conference. I don't want to cut off newspaper discussion about anything. But it isn't helpful for me to keep talking about certain foreign relations unless there is some development that warrants some statement on my part. I didn't really want to keep rehashing practically the same thing, because it irritates foreign countries oftentimes and they wonder why the White House keeps making statements that don't appear to them to be very helpful.
