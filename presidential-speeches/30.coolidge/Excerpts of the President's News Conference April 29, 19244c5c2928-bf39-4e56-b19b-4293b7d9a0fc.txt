Calvin Coolidge

Excerpts of the President's News Conference
There isn't much of anything I can say about the immigration bill. That is before the Committee in Conference. They are undertaking to see if some arrangement cannot be made which will provide for exclusion and at the same time avoid wounding the sensibilities of a friendly nation. In that I am in entire sympathy. I think that statement covers quite a good deal. I don't know that I could add anything to it by undertaking to amplify it. There are two things, exclusion and the ordinary courtesy of conduct that ought to characterize all the actions of the Government of the United States of America.
