Calvin Coolidge
February 24, 1925

Excerpts of the President's News Conference
There isn't anything that I can say about our European debts. As I have suggested before, I don't like constantly to talk about that. It gives the impression abroad that we are trying to coerce them, or something of that kind. It isn't helpful in our foreign relations, nor is it helpful in securing a state of mind that will result in making payments to us.
