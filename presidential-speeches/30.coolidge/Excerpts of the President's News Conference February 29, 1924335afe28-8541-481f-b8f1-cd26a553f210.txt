Excerpts of the President's News Conference
Here is an interesting suggestion. A news story in the Washington Star this afternoon hints at some drastic and mysterious action which the President proposes to take within the next few months. Would it be consistent to ask if the Chief Executive has in contemplation any radical departure from his present policies? I don't think any radical departures now occur to me. While I don't want to disagree with so good an authority as the Washington Star—I haven't the report before me, it is a report of a report and sometimes there is a variance in those things—I think you would be warranted in prophesying, if any of you want to prophesy, that I have at present no expectation of any drastic and mysterious action. I think it is rather foreign to me to have drastic and mysterious action. I suppose that is why this is news. It is somewhat different from what I have been doing and perhaps from what you gentlemen have led the public to expect of me.

I haven't any official information about the Mexican situation that amounts to anything. So far as I have any information, it indicates that President Obregon is at present successful. I don't know whether the revolt is entirely stamped out. I do not suppose it is. We don't have sources of information that would give either the Department of State or the public an exact picture of what is going on all over the Republic of Mexico, but it may be significant that we are not at present receiving any official complaints of disorders wherever any of our American citizens seem to be interested.
