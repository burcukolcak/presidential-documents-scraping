Excerpts of the President's News Conference
I have two or three inquiries here about the Vice-Presidency. I made a statement about that Tuesday, in which I undertook to announce that I had no candidate, and I adhere to that statement. Any reports contrary to that statement are, as perhaps some of you men know, without foundation. I usually keep my word for at least four days, and I can tell four days before the Convention what I am going to do. A good many very excellent men are mentioned for the Vice-Presidency. Many of them are perfectly acceptable to me, but I am not undertaking to approve one above another. Let the Convention select the man that after deliberation they think is best equipped to meet the situation. If I was going to pick out a candidate, I should want to go to Cleveland and talk with the various delegations when they come in, and find out what they think the requirements are, and what the sentiment is in the neighborhood in which they reside. In that way, I presume I could make up my mind what would be best. I am not as you understand making the slightest criticism of anybody, nor am I undertaking to promote any candidate. I am sorry that there are any reports that I am picking a candidate, and if there are any more of them they will be without any foundation.
