Calvin Coolidge
June 16, 1925

Excerpts of the President's News Conference
I don't know of any developments regarding the [Potomac] bathing beach. Some provision of the law has been brought to my attention that I didn't have particularly in mind at the last conference that seems to raise a question as to the authority of anyone doing anything with the bathing beaches. Congress enacted a law abolishing the bathing beach that was contemplated for colored people and abolished also the bathing beach that was in existence for the white people. I should think under that statute it would be somewhat difficult to take any action.
I haven't had any report from the Tariff Commission on butter, or straw hats, or gold leaf. I have a report on cotton gloves.
