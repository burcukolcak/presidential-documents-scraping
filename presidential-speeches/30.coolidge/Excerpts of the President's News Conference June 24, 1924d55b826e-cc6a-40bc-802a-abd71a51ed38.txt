Excerpts of the President's News Conference
I don't think any invitations have been received to participate in the allied conference on reparations, though I notice some suggestions in the press about it. I suppose that the attitude of our Government would be the same about that as it has been constantly about European affairs of that nature. We wouldn't want to take a part in their political discussions over there, and on the other hand we want to do everything we possibly can to assist in any way we can without getting into their political difficulties. Their political difficulties they can determine and decide themselves. Such assistance as we can give we are of course willing and anxious to give.
PRESS: Mr. President, do you think we are likely to be represented by an unofficial observer?
PRESIDENT: I don't think there will be any representation by our Government. It is very likely that what we should do would be to keep someone there who would keep us informed of what course affairs were taking. Of course it is recognized always that we have some interest in Europe direct and indirect about which we need to have information in order to protect our Government and protect our citizens. I shouldn't suppose that General Dawes would attend the conference on account of his participation in the campaign. Secretary Hughes would not reach London anyway until after July 16, and as our Gov-ernment would not be a participant in it, I do not think he would attend a conference of that kind even if he were there.
