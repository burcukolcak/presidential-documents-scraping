Calvin Coolidge
March 03, 1925

Excerpts of the President's News Conference
I shall take the oath of office tomorrow on a Bible that was given to me by my grandmother. That was the family Bible to which I referred the other day. Someone wrote in and wanted to furnish a Bible that George Washington had used, and I wrote thanking them and saying I had this family Bible and preferred to use that. It will be opened at the first chapter of John, which happens to be the first chapter of the Bible that I can recall reading. My grandfather was ill for a long time before he passed away and I used to read that chapter of the Bible to him when I was a small boy not more than four or five years old.
