Excerpts of the President's News Conference
Another inquiry as to whether the Navy's interests are adequately protected in the lease of the Teapot Dome. I haven't any detailed information about that. My judgment about it would be based on the confidence that I had in President Harding and Secretary Fall. I think there is some suggestion pending in Congress for an investigation. I don't know whether it will be carried out or not, but that should reveal, if it is carried outâ€”well, it is going on now, I believe. Yes. That, of course, will reveal the facts; so that, so far as I know, there is no action that could be taken by the President relative to it.
