Excerpts of the President's News Conference
There was nothing of importance discussed at the Cabinet this morning, other than the statement made by Mr. Hughes, which has been on paper and which will be given to the press if it has not already been given out, in relation to our participation in an effort to control the sale of arms. That is a different thing, as you see, from disarmament. This is a matter of selling it. We participated in a discussion of it and we have agreed on certain proposals. Then there came a proposal that we should sit in with the League of Nations for discussion, and our reply was that our position had already been made known and we would be glad to participate in an international conference, where of course we can sit in on an equality with everybody else, and enter into any kind of an arrangement that might seem practical and on which we thought we would be able to secure legislation to carry it into effect.
