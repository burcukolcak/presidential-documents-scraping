Calvin Coolidge
September 26, 1924

Excerpts of the President's News Conference
PRESS: Anything in the Cabinet, Mr. President?
PRESIDENT: Oh. No, there was no discussion in the Cabinet this morning, other than the report of [Agriculture] Secretary [Henry C.] Wallace that there had been a case of foot and mouth disease discovered in Texas. As soon as it was established, it was taken care of.

Mr. [Cornelius] Vanderbilt who started some newspapers in California dropped in to see me. I knew him when he was one of the reporters here in Washington. There was no special significance to his visit, other than that he came back to call on me, as I hope any one of you would who came back to Washington and started some newspapers and expected to start some more.
