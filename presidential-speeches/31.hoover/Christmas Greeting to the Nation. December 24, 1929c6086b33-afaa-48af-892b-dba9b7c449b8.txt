Christmas Greeting to the Nation.
MAY I have the privilege of wishing you all, and the great unseen audience, both a merry Christmas and a most happy new year ?
Note: The President's greeting was delivered at the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Sherman Square near the White House. The ceremony was broadcast nationwide.
The President touched a button to light the tree but was not scheduled to speak. As the ceremony concluded, however, he stepped to the microphone to deliver his impromptu greeting. The text of his greeting is quoted from a contemporary newspaper report.
