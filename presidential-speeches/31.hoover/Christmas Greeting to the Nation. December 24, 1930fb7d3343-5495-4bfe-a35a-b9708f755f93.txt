Christmas Greeting to the Nation.
Fellow citizens of Washington and my countrymen everywhere:
It is a great privilege to join in this community effort and it is a greater privilege even to wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
Note: The President spoke at 6 p.m. at the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Sherman Square near the White House. Prior to speaking he pressed a button lighting the tree.
The President's greeting and ceremony were broadcast to the Nation by the National Broadcasting Company. The text of the greeting is quoted from a contemporary newspaper report.
