Christmas Greeting to the Nation.
Mr. Vice President, the people of Washington and of our whole country-wide:
This is the season and this is the occasion when the whole Nation unites in good cheer and good wishes. We dedicate it particularly to our children, and we give devotion to the faith from which it is inspired.
It gives me great pleasure to join in this ceremony of the lighting of this tree, which is indeed symbolic of that in every household in our country. I ardently wish to every home a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
Note: The President spoke at 5 p.m. during ceremonies in which he lighted the national community Christmas tree in Sherman Square, Washington, D.C. The National Broadcasting Company radio network carried the remarks. As printed above, this item follows the text set forth in a contemporary news account.
