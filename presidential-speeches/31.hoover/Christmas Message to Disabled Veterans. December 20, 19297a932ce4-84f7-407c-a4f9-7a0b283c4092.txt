Christmas Message to Disabled Veterans.
To all disabled ex-service men and women:
I send you cordial Christmas greetings and my best wishes for your happiness in the new year, and I do pray for your restoration to health. Your country has not forgotten you and will not forget. The Nation's pride in your valor and devotion, and its gratitude for the service you have rendered, are manifest in its continued concern for your welfare and in its warm sympathy and regard for you.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The White House announced that the message was sent to veterans' organizations and hospitals throughout the country.
