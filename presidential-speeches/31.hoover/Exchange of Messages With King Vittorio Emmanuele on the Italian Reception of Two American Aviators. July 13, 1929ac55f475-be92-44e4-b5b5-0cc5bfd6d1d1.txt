Exchange of Messages With King Vittorio Emmanuele on the Italian Reception of Two American Aviators.
[Released July 13, 1929. Dated July 12, 1929]
I WISH to thank Your Majesty for your gracious telegram, as well as for the cordial reception which the American aviators, Messrs. Williams and Yancey, have received from the people of Italy.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Majesty Vittorio Emmanuele Third, King of Italy, Rome]
Note: Captain Lewis A. Yancey and Roger Q. Williams flew nonstop from Old Orchard, Maine, to Santander, Spain, on July 8 and 9, 1929. Their destination was Rome, but head winds and fog forced a premature descent. They later flew to Rome where they received a warm welcome.
The President's message was in response to a message from King Vittorio Emmanuele, which read as follows
The American aviators have happily alighted on the soil of Italy, and I am happy to express to you, Mr. President, the keen pleasure I and the Italian nation feel at the superb test of the bold American wing.
VITTORIO EMMANUELE
[His Excellency President Hoover, Washington ]
