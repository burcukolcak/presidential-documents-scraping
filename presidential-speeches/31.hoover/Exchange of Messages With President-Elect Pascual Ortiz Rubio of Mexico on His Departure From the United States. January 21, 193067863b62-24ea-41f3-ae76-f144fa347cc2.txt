Note: The President's message was in response to a message from President-elect Ortiz Rubio, dated January 16, 1930, and released with the President's. A translation of the President-elect's message follows:
On stepping on Mexican soil I desire to express to you, Mr. President, my very sincere gratitude for the generous and cordial hospitality which I received from your great country and, especially, for the repeated marks of courtesy and sympathy towards my native land with which you were good enough to honor me during my stay in Washington. The message which I am sending today to the American people through the Associated Press is the most heart-felt and sincere expression of my thought. Together with our affectionate greetings for Mrs. Hoover and yourself, I desire also to send my deep thanks to all the officials of your administration and the military and civil authorities in general who lavished attentions and courtesies, which are greatly appreciated, to render my good will tour agreeable, and brilliantly successful for the relations between the two countries.
PASCUAL ORTIZ RUBIO
[The President, Washington, D.C.]
