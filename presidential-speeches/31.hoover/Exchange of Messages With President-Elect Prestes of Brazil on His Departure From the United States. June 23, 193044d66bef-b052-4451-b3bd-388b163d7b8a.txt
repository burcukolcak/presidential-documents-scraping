[Released June 23, 1930. Dated June 21, 1930]
I HAVE received Your Excellency's farewell message on your departure for your homeland, and on behalf of the American people and in my own name, I beg to express to you the keen pleasure and satisfaction we experienced in your most welcome visit. Your Excellency's short stay with us has clearly demonstrated that the friendship and good will which has always been in the hearts of the American people is strongly reciprocated by our sister Republic of South America, and I am confident that your coming to us will bear rich fruits in a better understanding which will redound to the prosperity of both countries. I wish for Your Excellency a pleasant voyage and prosperity manyfold in the administration of your high office, in which I am joined by Mrs. Hoover.

With the profound impression which I received of the progress of the United States and the cordiality of its people, I carry with me the ever greater assurance of that friendship and I am firmly convinced that its development cannot but result in advantages for our countries.
