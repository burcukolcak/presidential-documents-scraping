Exchange of Messages With Regent Nicholas von Horthy on the Inauguration of Direct Radiotelegraphic Service Between Hungary and the United States.
I THANK Your Serene Highness for the cordial expression of good wishes contained in your radio telegram inaugurating the new system of direct communication between Hungary and the United States. Rapid communication of information and ideas between nations is one of the most valuable means of fostering international understanding. I trust that this new means of communication between Hungary and the United States will serve to maintain the friendly relations so happily existing between the two countries.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Serene Highness, The Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary, Budapest, Hungary]
Note: Regent von Horthy's message, as set forth in a contemporary news account, follows:
I am delighted to embrace the opportunity afforded by the opening of the direct radiotelegraphic communication between Hungary and the United States of North America to express to Your Excellency my most cordial greeting and to convey to the great American Nation the warmest greeting of the Hungarian Nation. I feel convinced that this new radio-electric connection will also contribute to promote a further deepening of the traditional ties of sentiment established by our predecessors and existing today unchanged between the United States and Hungary, and to strengthen and develop the mutual and economic relations between our two countries.
HORTHY
Regent of Hungary
[President Hoover, Washington, D.C. ]
