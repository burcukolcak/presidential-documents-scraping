Exchange of Messages With the President of Poland on the Pulaski Sesquicentennial Celebration.
[Released October 11, 1929. Dated October 10, 1929]
I HAVE received Your Excellency's message in connection with the Pulaski Sesquicentennial Celebration now being held in this country. The memory of this young Polish nobleman who joined the forces of the American Colonists and fought so heroically and courageously from the time he was welcomed into General Washington's staff until mortally wounded in the siege of Savannah, will always be cherished in the [p.324] hearts of American citizens and their heartfelt appreciation of his signal service in acquiring American independence will never die.
I shall be happy to greet Your Excellency's distinguished delegation and through them to assure Your Excellency of my country's gratitude and friendship for Poland.

Note: The message was in response to a message from President Ignacy Moscicki, dated October 9, 1929, which read as follows:
On the hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the death of General Pulaski at the Battle of Savannah, I hasten to express to your Excellency my own and the entire Polish Nation's deep appreciation and gratitude for the manner in which the name of this Polish and American hero is being honored by the United States. As a mark of this occasion I have appointed Minister [Tytus] Filipowicz to be my Special Ambassador to you at the coming ceremonies. May I also express to you my sincere conviction that Pulaski who is a symbol of our common efforts at a difficult hour survives not only as a tradition of the past but also as an ideal of the true friendship of our nations and of their future close cooperation on the road of progress and liberty.
