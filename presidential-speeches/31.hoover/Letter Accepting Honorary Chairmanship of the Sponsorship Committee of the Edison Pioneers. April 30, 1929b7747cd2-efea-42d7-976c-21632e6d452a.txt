[Released April 30, 1929. Dated April 12, 1929]
My dear Mr. Barstow:
I have your kind letter of March 30th, requesting that I accept the Honorary Chairmanship of the Sponsorship Committee of the Edison Pioneers.
I shall be delighted to act in any capacity that will be a genuine tribute to Mr. Edison's services.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. W. S. Barstow, The Edison Pioneers, Dearborn, Michigan]
Note: The Edison Pioneers were a group of individuals who had been associated with Thomas A. Edison during his early career. In 1929, they played the leading role in organizing "Light's Golden Jubilee," a celebration commemorating the 50th anniversary of Edison's invention of the incandescent lamp. Following a series of "light festivals" in various cities, the celebration came to a climax on October 21 with a ceremony in Dearborn, Mich., sponsored by Henry Ford and featuring the dedication of a restored Menlo Park Laboratory and a new Edison Institute of Technology. President Hoover was honorary chairman of the committee organizing the celebration and also a featured speaker at the Dearborn ceremony.
