Letter Accepting the Resignation of General John H. Russell as American High Commissioner to Haiti.
[Released November 1, 1930. Dated October 29, 1930]
My dear General Russell:
In accepting your resignation as American High Commissioner to Haiti, I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the loyal and efficient manner in which you have fulfilled your difficult mission.
The material progress which has been achieved during the eight years of your incumbency of the office of High Commissioner is substantial and impressive. Haitian finances have been placed on a sound basis, commerce has revived, adequate roads now connect the important cities, schools and hospitals have been built, agriculture and industries have been developed and encouraged and outstanding work has been accomplished in introducing sanitary measures through the entire Republic.
These results have been largely due to your administrative ability and the high minded purpose which has animated you in the performance of your task.
I wish also to express my warm appreciation of the excellent spirit of cooperation with which you facilitated the important work accomplished by the recent Commission for the study and review of conditions in the Republic of Haiti. Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Brigadier General John H. Russell, Port au Prince, Haiti]
