Letter Accepting the Resignation of Herbert M. Lord as Director of the Budget.
[Released June 1, 1929. Dated May 23, 1929]
My dear General Lord:
I regret intensely to accept your resignation as Director of the Budget. I realize, of course, that it is not possible for men to continue in government service at the remuneration the government affords, and that I have no right to call on you for further sacrifice in the face of the opportunity that has come to you to provide some savings against old age.
I do wish to take this occasion to voice the debt owed to you by the country for your devoted and able service and the high appreciation you have won throughout the government in the conduct of your office.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[General H. M. Lord, Director of the Budget, Washington, D.C.]
Note: Gen. Herbert Mayhew Lord served as Director of the Budget from 1922 until his resignation. For the President's news conference remarks on General Lord's resignation, see Item 97.
