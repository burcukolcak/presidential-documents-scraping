Letter Accepting the Resignation of Hubert Work as Chairman of the Republican National Committee.
My dear Dr. Work:
I intensely regret your determination to resign the Chairmanship of the Republican National Committee. I am, of course, aware that when you accepted the Chairmanship last June, you made it conditional on your retirement soon after election, and I deeply appreciate your willingness to continue on at my urgent request. I fully realize your desire that someone else should undertake the increasing burdens and anxieties of the party chairmanship which are imposed by each new campaign.
Beyond my own appreciation of your great services the Republican Party owes you a deep debt for its accomplishments under your direction for there has never been a campaign conducted with greater success or upon a higher plane, or one that has proved itself so far above all criticism.
You have given many years of distinguished public service and I know your reluctance to undertake further burdens, but I am in hopes that you will some time in the future be willing to again return to public life.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. Hubert Work, Republican National Committee, Washington, D.C.]
