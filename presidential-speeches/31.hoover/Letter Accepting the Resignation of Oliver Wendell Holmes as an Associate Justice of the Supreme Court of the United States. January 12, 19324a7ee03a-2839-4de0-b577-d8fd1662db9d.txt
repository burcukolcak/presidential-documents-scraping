Herbert Hoover
January 12, 1932

Letter Accepting the Resignation of Oliver Wendell Holmes as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
My dear Mr. Justice:
I am in receipt of your letter of January 12th tendering your resignation from the Supreme Court of the United States. I must, of course, accept it.
No appreciation I could express would even feebly represent the gratitude of the American people for your whole life of wonderful public service, from the time you were an officer in the Civil War to this day-near your ninety-first anniversary. I know of no American retiring from public service with such a sense of affection and devotion of the whole people.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable Oliver Wendell Holmes, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D.C.]
Note: Justice Holmes had served on the Supreme Court since 1902.
On February 15, 1932, the President nominated Benjamin N. Cardozo to fill the vacancy. The Senate confirmed the nomination on February 24, and he assumed his duties on March 14.
Justice Holmes' letter of resignation, dated January 12, 1932, and released with the President's, follows:
Mr. President:
In accordance with the provision of the Judicial Code as amended Section 260-Title 28 United States Code 375, I tender my resignation as Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States of America. The condition of my health makes it a duty to break off connections that I cannot leave without deep regret after the affectionate relations of many years and the absorbing interests that have filled my life. But the time has come and I bow to the inevitable. I have nothing but kindness to remember from you and from my brethren. My last word should be' one of grateful thanks.
With great respect,
Your obedient servant
OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES
