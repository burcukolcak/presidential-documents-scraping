Letter Accepting the Resignation of Wendell P. Stafford as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.
[Released May 5, 1931. Dated May 4, 1931]
My dear Mr. Justice:
It was with great regret that I received your letter of resignation today. I deeply appreciate your kind personal note of friendship.
I must, of course, accept your resignation. At the same time I would like to express to you the appreciation I have, and that I know the public has for the long and devoted service given to the country, and for the high ideals of the Federal Bench which you have so consistently maintained.
In the release from your responsibilities of office, I wish for you every happiness.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable Wendell P. Stafford, Justice of the Supreme Court, Washington, D.C.]
