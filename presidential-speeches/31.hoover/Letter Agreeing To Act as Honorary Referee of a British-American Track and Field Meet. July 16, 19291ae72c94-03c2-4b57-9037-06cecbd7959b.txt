Letter Agreeing To Act as Honorary Referee of a British-American Track and Field Meet.
I SHALL be pleased to act as an honorary referee to the field games between the visiting teams of Oxford and Cambridge and the American teams from Princeton and, Cornell, and only regret that my duties here will not permit me to be present and witness them in person.
The character building influence of clean sports is such that they deserve every encouragement, and besides that, I should have been glad of the opportunity to welcome these fine young men visiting our shores.
Note: The letter was made public by John T. McGovern, chairman of the committee in charge of the meet, which was held in New York City. As printed above, this item follows the text set forth in a contemporary news account.
