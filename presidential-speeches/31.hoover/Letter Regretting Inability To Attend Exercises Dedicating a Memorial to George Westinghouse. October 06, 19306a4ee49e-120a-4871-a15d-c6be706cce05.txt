Letter Regretting Inability To Attend Exercises Dedicating a Memorial to George Westinghouse.
[Released October 6, 1930. Dated October 1, 1930]
Gentlemen:
While it will be impossible for me to attend the exercises dedicating the memorial to George Westinghouse on October 6th, I wish your Committee to know that I have a high appreciation of the outstanding accomplishments of Mr. Westinghouse during his notable career.
The inventions he created and the industrial institutions he established have been a most substantial contribution to our American life.
Characters such as he well deserve to be honored by their contemporaries and their successors. You do well to commemorate his memory.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Messrs. A. L. Humphrey and A. W. Robertson, Committee]
Note: The letter was read at a ceremony in Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, Pa., where a monument to George Westinghouse was unveiled.
