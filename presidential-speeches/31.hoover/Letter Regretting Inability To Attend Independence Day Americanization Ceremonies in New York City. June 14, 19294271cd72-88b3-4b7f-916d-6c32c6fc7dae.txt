Letter Regretting Inability To Attend Independence Day Americanization Ceremonies in New York City.
[Released June 14, 1929. Dated June 13, 1929]
My dear Mr. Mayor:
The graciousness of your invitation to speak in the City of New York on the night of July Fourth, and the high object of the occasion of the address that you propose, makes me doubly regretful that I must decline. The posture of business here makes it extremely unlikely that I shall be able to leave Washington on that day, and were that possible I should still have several earlier invitations to consider. The entrance of new citizens upon the full measure of the responsibilities of their new allegiance to our American ideals of law and custom is always a most appealing occasion, and I am sorry indeed that I must miss this [p.186] opportunity in person to welcome these into the family of our nation.
With my kind regards to you personally,
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. James J. Walker, Mayor of New York, New York City]
