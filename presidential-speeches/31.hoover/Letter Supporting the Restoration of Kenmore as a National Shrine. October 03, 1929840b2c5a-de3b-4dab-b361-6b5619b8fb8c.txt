Letter Supporting the Restoration of Kenmore as a National Shrine.
[Released October 3, 1929. Dated May 27, 1929]
My dear Mrs. Fleming:
Kenmore, like Mount Vernon, should become another National shrine of the gracious domestic life of the many-sided George Washington.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER

Note: Kenmore is a colonial mansion in Fredericksburg, Va., which was built by Col. Fielding Lewis and his wife Elizabeth (Betty) Washington Lewis, the only sister of George Washington. The Kenmore Association successfully restored and preserved this historic structure which is open to the public.
