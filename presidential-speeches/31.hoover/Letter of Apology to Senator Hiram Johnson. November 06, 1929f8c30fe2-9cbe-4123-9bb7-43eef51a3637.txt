Letter of Apology to Senator Hiram Johnson.
My dear Mr. Senator:
I was greatly distressed to learn from the press last night that you did not receive an invitation to the dinner given at the White House for Ambassadors Dawes and Guggenheim, to which the members of the Foreign Relations Committee who were in the city or available, were invited. Directions to send out the invitations were given on Monday and in the hurried telephoning to Senators and settlement of other details an inadvertence occurred somewhere.
I am most deeply pained that such an accident should have happened, with such an apparent lack of courtesy, and I hope you will accept my assurances that it was due entirely to a mistake which is most deeply regretted by all of us. Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable Hiram Johnson, United States Senate, Washington, D.C.]
