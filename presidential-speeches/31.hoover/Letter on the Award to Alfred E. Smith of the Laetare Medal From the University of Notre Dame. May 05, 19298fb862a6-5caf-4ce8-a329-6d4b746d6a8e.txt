My dear Dr. O'Donnell:
I have your letter of the 22nd, informing me that the Laetare Medal from the University of Notre Dame will on the 5th of May be awarded to Governor Alfred E. Smith.
I am glad you have thus given me the opportunity to join in congratulations to Governor Smith for the honor which you confer upon so distinguished an American and to the University for its public spirit in honoring so great a public servant.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
