Letter on the Presentation of the American Hebrew Medal to Archbishop Edward J. Hanna.
[Released November 19, 1931. Dated November 16, 1931]
My dear Rabbi Landman:
I have learned with pleasure that the American Hebrew Medal for the Promotion of Better Understanding between Christian and Jew will be presented this year to Archbishop Edward J. Hanna of San Francisco. This distinguished Prelate has done much to promote that comity, resulting from better understanding, which forwards the objective this award has in view. I wish to congratulate, through you, the committee making the award and its worthy recipient.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
