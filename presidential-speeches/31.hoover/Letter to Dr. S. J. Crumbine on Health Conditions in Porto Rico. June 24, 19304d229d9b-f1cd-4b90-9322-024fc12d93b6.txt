Letter to Dr. S. J. Crumbine on Health Conditions in Porto Rico.
[Released June 24, 1930. Dated December 13, 1929]
My dear Crumbine:
You have perhaps seen some of the statements made by Governor Roosevelt of Porto Rico as to the condition of Porto Rican children. There seems to be a very genuine case for some systematic service.
I would like very much if the American Child Health Association could send down a staff of competent people, prepared to examine the whole situation in Porto Rico from a health, a nutritional, and a social point of view so far as it affects children.
I do not know what it would cost, but if you will take this up with Mr. Rickard it will serve as a recommendation from me to him to find you the necessary funds.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Dr. S. J. Crumbine, American Child Health Association, 370 Seventh Avenue, New York City]
Note: The letter was made public in connection with an appeal by Gov. Theodore Roosevelt and the American Child Health Association for $7,300,000 to improve child health facilities.
The President referred to Edgar Rickard, Director General of the American Relief Administration and treasurer of both the American Child Health Association and the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection.
On May 19, 1930, the White House released Dr. Crumbine's report of April 21, 1930, entitled "Report of the American Child Health Association on the Health, Nutritional and Social Conditions of Porto Rican Children."
