Letter to Governor Harry G. Leslie About the Indiana Conference on Child Health and Protection.
[Released January 16, 1931. Dated January 14, 1931 ]
My dear Governor Leslie:
I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the Indiana Conference on Child Health and Protection and my regret that a previous engagement prevents me from speaking to them directly by telephone. There is an especial reason for wishing to speak to this first of many State and regional groups who will carry forward the work of the White House Conference. The conclusions of that Conference, so far as they propose immediately practical measures in behalf of childhood, depend for their application chiefly upon the States and the local communities. The Federal Government can help with information and research, and toward the creation of administrative agencies and the funds to assist in support of them, but they rest primarily with States and counties, cooperating often with private agencies and dealing with the problem at close range and in the light of local conditions. The work in behalf of children is so intimately a part of the life of the people that its control and direction need to be kept very close to them. I look forward with high anticipation to the success of your Conference.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable Harry G. Leslie, State House, Indianapolis, Indiana]
Note: The letter was read to the conference, meeting in Indianapolis, Ind. The group was the first State organization to follow up the work of the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. See 1930 volume, Item 376.
