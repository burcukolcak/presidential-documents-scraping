Letter to Isaac Kip Expressing Appreciation for His Vote Cast Under Difficulties.
[Released April 4, 1929. Dated April 3, 1929]
My dear Mr. Kip:
I have just learned that despite the serious condition of your health you insisted upon being taken to the polls in order to cast your vote for me at the election last Fall and I want you to know of my appreciation. It is gratifying to have such evidence of confidence on the part of one who has seen so much of the growth and development of our country.
With best wishes,
Faithfully yours,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Isaac Kip, Ossining Hospital, Ossining, New York]
Note: At the time of the 1928 election, Isaac Kip, an 84-year-old Quaker, was confined to a hospital in Ossining, N.Y., for injuries suffered in an automobile accident. Nevertheless, he managed to vote for President Hoover by having himself carried in his armchair to the polls some two blocks away. Upon hearing of the incident, Lawrence Richey, Secretary to the President, arranged for the above letter.
