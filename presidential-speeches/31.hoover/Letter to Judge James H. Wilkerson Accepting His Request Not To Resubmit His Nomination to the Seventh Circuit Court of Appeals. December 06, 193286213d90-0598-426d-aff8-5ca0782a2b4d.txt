December 06, 1932

Letter to Judge James H. Wilkerson Accepting His Request Not To Resubmit His Nomination to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
My dear Judge Wilkerson:
I am in receipt of your letter of December 1st, asking that I should not resubmit your name to the Senate for appointment to the Seventh Circuit.
I deeply regret that you have come to this conclusion. I should have been proud to submit your name because I am confident that the people at large feel as I do the important and devoted service you have given, and the high contribution you have made to the standing of the judiciary of the United States.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. James H. Wilkerson, United States District Court, Chicago, Ill.]
Note: The President nominated Judge Wilkerson to the position on January 12, 1932.
Judge Wilkerson's letter, dated December 1, 1932, and released with the President's letter, follows:
Dear Mr. President:
Senator Glenn tells me that you have indicated your willingness to resubmit my nomination. Despite two favorable reports by the subcommittee it was not acted upon at the last session. In the light of recent statements by those who unquestionably have the power to make them effective, there seems to be no reason to expect a different result at the coming session. I wish, therefore, that my nomination be not resubmitted.
I shall always value highly your estimate of my work as evidenced by this nomination.
With sincere regards and best wishes, I am,
Very truly yours,
JAMES H. WILKERSON
[Honorable Herbert Hoover, The President, The White House, Washington, D.C.]
