Letter to Senator Reed Smoot on Representation of Silver Interests at a World Economic Conference.
I HAVE your inquiry as to whether it has been finally settled that the silver question will be dealt with at the forthcoming World Economic Conference and as to the constitution of the American Delegation to the Conference. At the request of the American government it has been agreed that the silver question will be a part of the conference. In making up the American Delegation I shall appoint someone representing the silver point of view as a member of the delegation. I prefer this representative to be a real representative of the silver mining interest and from the western portion of the United States.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable Reed Smoot, Hotel Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah]
Note: On August 2, 1932, the United States had formally accepted an invitation from the League of Nations to participate in a world monetary and economic conference.
In voting appropriations to defray the expenses of participation, Congress had stipulated that the silver question be placed on the agenda.
