Letter to W. J. L. Banham on the Survey Made by the New York Board of Trade.
[Released April 9, 1930. Dated April 7, 1930]
My dear Mr. Banham :
I have your kind letter of April 4th. I have been much interested in the survey made by the New York Board of Trade, which is very encouraging.
I am to deliver an address before the United States Chamber of Commerce in the course of the next few weeks, on which occasion I hope to make a statement as to the business situation.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. W. J. L. Banham, New York Board of Trade, Inc., 41 Park Row, New York City]
Note: The survey referred to in the letter brought together some 1,000 reports on all lines of business. Eighty-six percent of the returns indicated an expectation of business revival in the spring.
