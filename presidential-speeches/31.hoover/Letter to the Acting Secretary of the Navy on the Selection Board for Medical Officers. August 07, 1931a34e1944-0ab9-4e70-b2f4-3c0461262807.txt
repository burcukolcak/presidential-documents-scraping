Letter to the Acting Secretary of the Navy on the Selection Board for Medical Officers.
[Released August 7, 1931. Dated July 17, 1931]
My dear Mr. Secretary:
I am in receipt of your letter of even date informing me of the action of the Navy Department in convening a new board for the selection of medical officers.
I wish it to be known and recorded by the new board that the President has no interest in this matter other than to see that the best men should receive promotions.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable, The Acting Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D.C.]
Note: Ernest Lee Jahncke was Acting Secretary of the Navy.
