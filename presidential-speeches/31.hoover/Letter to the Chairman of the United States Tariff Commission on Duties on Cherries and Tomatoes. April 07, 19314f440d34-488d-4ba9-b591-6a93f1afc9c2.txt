Letter to the Chairman of the United States Tariff Commission on Duties on Cherries and Tomatoes.
[Released April 7, 1931. Dated April 1, 1931]
My dear Mr. Chairman:
I am returning without approval, the reports of the Commission on tomatoes, prepared or preserved in any manner, and on cherries, sulphured or in brine. No criticism of the work of the Commission, either direct or indirect, is implied but this investigation was of necessity based upon conditions maintaining before the emergency created by the drought and in some cases upon data over a period of so short experience as make it desirable that the Commission be afforded more time.
I should like it therefore if the Commission would undertake to review the facts upon the basis of the forthcoming crops and make another report.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. Henry P. Fletcher, Chairman, U.S. Tariff Commission, Washington, D.C.]
