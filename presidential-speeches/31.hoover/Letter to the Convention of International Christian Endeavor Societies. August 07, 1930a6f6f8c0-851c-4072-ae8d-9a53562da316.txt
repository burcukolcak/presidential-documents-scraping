Letter to the Convention of International Christian Endeavor Societies.
[Released August 7, 1930. Dated June 28, 1930]
My dear Dr. Poling:
I want you to know of my personal regret that the long established custom in relation to conventions in foreign lands prevents my sending you a formal message for the Convention of International Christian Endeavor Societies meeting in Berlin.
I do wish to congratulate you upon your able leadership of those fine organizations of Christian youth, and I appreciate their important share in the religious life and social progress of our country. I wish for them all a happy and useful journey in a great cause.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Rev. Daniel A. Poling, D.D., World Christian Endeavor Building, Boston, Mass.]
Note: The message was read at the convention being held in Berlin, Germany. Representatives from 63 nations attended.
