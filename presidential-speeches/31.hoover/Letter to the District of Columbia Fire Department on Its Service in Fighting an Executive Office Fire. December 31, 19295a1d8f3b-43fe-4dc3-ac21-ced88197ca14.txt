[Released December 31, 1929. Dated December 30, 1929]
My dear Chief Watson:
I want you to know of my appreciation of the excellent service rendered by you and the men of your Department during and following the fire in the Executive Office on Christmas eve. It was a fine piece of work and I thank you sincerely for all your efforts.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Chief Engineer George S. Watson, Fire Department, Washington, D.C.]
Note: Shortly after the President's return to the White House from the Christmas tree lighting ceremony on December 24, fire was discovered in the executive office wing of the White House, and he watched from the roof as firemen fought the [p.493] blaze. The President's personal files were saved, but the building suffered extensive damage and he was forced to vacate the offices during reconstruction. The fire did not reach the White House itself.
