Letter to the President Pro Tempore on the Special Session of the Senate.
[Released July 2, 1930. Dated June 26, 1930]
My dear Mr. Senator:
I have your letter of June 24th enclosing the request of a number of senators that the proposed extra session of the Senate be deferred until next November.
I realize fully the great strain which has been placed upon the Senate by this long continued session. On the other hand the national interest in having the Naval Treaty brought to a conclusion is so great, I feel that I must ask that it should be dealt with at the earliest possible date.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable George H. Moses, United States Senate]
