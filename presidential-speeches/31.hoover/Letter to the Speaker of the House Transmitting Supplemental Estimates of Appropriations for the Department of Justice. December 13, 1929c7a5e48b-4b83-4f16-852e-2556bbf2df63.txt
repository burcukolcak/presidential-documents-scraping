Letter to the Speaker of the House Transmitting Supplemental Estimates of Appropriations for the Department of Justice.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives:
SIR: I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress supplemental estimates of appropriations for the Department of Justice for the fiscal year 1930 amounting to $374,091, consisting of $62,000 for protecting the interests of the United States under the settlement of war claims act of 1928, and $312,091 for the United States Industrial Reformatory, Chillicothe, Ohio.
The details of these estimates, the necessity therefor, and the reason for their submission at this time are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget transmitted herewith, with whose comments and observations thereon I concur.
As the appropriations for these activities will be exhausted about January 1, 1930, I hope that the estimates will receive the early consideration of Congress.
Respectfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
The White House,
December 13, 1929
