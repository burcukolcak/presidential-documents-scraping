Message Commending the Work of the National Safety Council.
[ Released September 29, 1930. Dated September 25, 1930]
My dear Mr. Pettibone:
I deeply appreciate the value of the work of the National Safety Council in efforts to prevent the frightful loss of human life due to preventable accidents in industry and elsewhere. The death by accident of almost one hundred thousand persons in one year in the United States is a challenge to the resourcefulness of the Nation to devise measures to eliminate this disastrous loss both of economic assets and of precious human values. Most of it is preventable and your educational campaigns to teach the methods of such prevention are worthy of all praise.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. C. E. Pettibone, President, National Safety Council, William Penn Hotel, Pittsburgh, Pa. ]
