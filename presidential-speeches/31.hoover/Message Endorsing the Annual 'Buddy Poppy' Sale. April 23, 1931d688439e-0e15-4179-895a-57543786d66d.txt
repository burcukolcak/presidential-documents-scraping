Message Endorsing the Annual 'Buddy Poppy' Sale.
[Released April 23, 1931. Dated April 15, 1931 ]
My dear Commander:
I warmly commend the annual "Buddy Poppy" Campaign which is conducted under the auspices of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States as a means of general civilian contribution in the relief work for disabled and needy veterans and their dependents. It not only gives employment to disabled veterans, but also it aids in the maintenance of a National Home for Widows and Orphans of deceased veterans in Eaton Rapids, Michigan.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Commander-In-Chief, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, Washington, D.C. ]
Note: The message was released in conjunction with ceremonies at the White House when Hazel Viola Markinson, 7-year-old daughter of a deceased veteran, presented a "buddy poppy" to the President.
