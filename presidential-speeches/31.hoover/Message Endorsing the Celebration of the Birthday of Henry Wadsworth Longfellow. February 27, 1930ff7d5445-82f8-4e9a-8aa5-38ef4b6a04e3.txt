Message Endorsing the Celebration of the Birthday of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
[Released February 27, 1930. Dated February 26, 1930]
I CORDIALLY approve the idea of initiating the celebration of the birthday of the poet Longfellow by the city of his birth. His songs have been a part of the fabric of American life for generations, and due honor should be paid his memory as a man of wonderful character as well as a poet of universal appeal.

Note: The message, sent to Henry F. Merrill, vice president and chairman for the Maine New England Council, Portland, Maine, was read during a luncheon held by the Thirteen Club marking the 123d anniversary of Longfellow's birth.
