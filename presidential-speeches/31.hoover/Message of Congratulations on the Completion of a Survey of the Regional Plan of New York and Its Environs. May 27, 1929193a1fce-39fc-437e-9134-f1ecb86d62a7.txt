Message of Congratulations on the Completion of a Survey of the Regional Plan of New York and Its Environs.
[Released May 27, 1929. Dated May 25, 1929]
My dear Mr. Delano:
I congratulate all who have shared in the labors of preparing the survey and plan of the Regional Plan of New York and Its Environs, the completion of which you celebrate at the meeting on Monday evening. The far-sighted vision that led you to look far ahead to the distant evolution of a great and growing city, and the sense of civic responsibility that impelled you to plan for its enlightened development, with wise regard for the health of the inhabitants and the beauty [p.156] and convenience of their surroundings, are an inspiration to all who trust in the capacity of democracies to evolve leadership that is at once idealistic and practical.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Frederic A. Delano, Chairman, Regional Plan of New York and Its Environs, 130 East 22nd Street, New York City]
