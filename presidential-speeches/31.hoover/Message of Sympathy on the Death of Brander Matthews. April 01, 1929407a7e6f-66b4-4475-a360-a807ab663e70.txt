Message of Sympathy on the Death of Brander Matthews.
I AM profoundly sorry to hear of the death of your brother. His personality endeared him to all who knew him. His loss will be keenly felt by many thousands who never saw him, for he enriched our knowledge of one of the most important fields of culture, stimulated others to a wider appreciation of dramatic art, and inspired many younger men to do creative literary work.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message was sent to Mr. Matthew's sister, Miss Florence Matthews, 337 West 87th Street, New York City. Brander Matthews was the author of plays, books and articles about the American and English legitimate theater.
