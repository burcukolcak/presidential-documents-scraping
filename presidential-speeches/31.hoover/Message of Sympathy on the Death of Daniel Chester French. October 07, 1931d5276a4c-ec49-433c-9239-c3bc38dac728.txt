Message of Sympathy on the Death of Daniel Chester French.
I DEEPLY REGRET to learn of the death of your husband, Daniel Chester French. He was recognized not only in this country but throughout the world as an artist of preeminent skill and power. He wrought in marble imperishable incidents and personages of American history. His statute of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial in the National Capital will be a National shrine forever. I extend to you and your daughter heartfelt sympathy in your sorrow.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Daniel Chester French, Stockbridge, Mass.]
