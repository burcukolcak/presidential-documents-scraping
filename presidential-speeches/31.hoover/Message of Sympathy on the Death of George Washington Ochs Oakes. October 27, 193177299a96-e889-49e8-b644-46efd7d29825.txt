Message of Sympathy on the Death of George Washington Ochs Oakes.
I AM greatly shocked and saddened by the death of your brother, George Washington Ochs Oakes. His patriotism was reflected in all his service to the public welfare. I prized his friendship and mourn his loss as a friend and a splendid American. I extend to you my deep sympathy and shall appreciate it if you will convey to Mr. Ochs Oakes' sons an expression of my sorrow in their bereavement.
