Message of Sympathy on the Death of Jean Jules Jusserand.
I AM SORELY grieved to learn of Mr. Jusserand's death and Mrs. Hoover and I send you our sincere sympathy in your bereavement. France has lost a distinguished and loyal citizen and the United States a true and firm friend whose wonderful influence for right and justice has meant so much in our relations with France. We mourn with our sister Republic the passing of this truly great man.
