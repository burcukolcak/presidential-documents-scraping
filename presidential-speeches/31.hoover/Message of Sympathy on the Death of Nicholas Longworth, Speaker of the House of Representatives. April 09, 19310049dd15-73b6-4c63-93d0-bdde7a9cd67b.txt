Message of Sympathy on the Death of Nicholas Longworth, Speaker of the House of Representatives.
My dear Mrs. Longworth:
I am profoundly grieved to learn of the passing of your husband, and wish you to know how deeply Mrs. Hoover and I sympathize with you in your bereavement. He was endeared to the whole people by his charm and graciousness, and his distinguished public services entitled him to the honors which he bore so modestly and yet so worthily. He will be mourned by the Nation and long held in their affectionate and grateful memory.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Nicholas Longworth, care of James F. Curtis, Aiken, South Carolina]
