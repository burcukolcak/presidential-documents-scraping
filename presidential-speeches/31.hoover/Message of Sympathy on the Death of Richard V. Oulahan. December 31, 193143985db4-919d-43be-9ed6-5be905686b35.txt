Message of Sympathy on the Death of Richard V. Oulahan.
[Released December 31, 1931. Dated December 30, 1931]
Dear Mrs. Oulahan:
I have learned with profound regret of the death of your husband. Richard V. Oulahan was an outstanding journalist, a good friend and a wise counsellor. Few writers of our day have done more to disseminate truth regarding national affairs, always for the advancement of our country. He was highly deserving of the designation voluntarily given to him by his fellow journalists, "dean" of the corps of Washington correspondents. His passing is a personal loss to me. Mrs. Hoover joins with me in expressing heartfelt sympathy to you and yours.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Richard V. Oulahan, 1518 31st Street, Washington, D.C.]
Note: Mr. Oulahan, chief Washington correspondent for the New York Times, died on December 30, 1931.
