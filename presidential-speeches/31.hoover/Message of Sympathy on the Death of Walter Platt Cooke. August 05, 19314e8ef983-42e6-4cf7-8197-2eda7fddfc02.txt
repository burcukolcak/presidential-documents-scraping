Message of Sympathy on the Death of Walter Platt Cooke.
I HAVE LEARNED with sorrow of the death of your husband, Walter Platt Cooke. His devotion to his community and country led him into distinguished service in the United States, and his insight into world affairs enabled him to contribute greatly to the solution of the international financial problems growing out of the World War. The value of his services was recognized in the positions of responsibility which he filled in the fields of finance, law and education and by honors accorded him by the governments of France, Belgium and Italy. I wish to extend to you and your son and daughter my deepest sympathy in your bereavement.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Walter Platt Cooke, 155 Summer Street, Buffalo, New York]
Note: Mr. Cooke, an internationally known lawyer, had been a member of the Reparations Commission.
