Message of Sympathy to Emperor Hirohito on the Death of Three Japanese Aviators.
I DESIRE to extend to you and to the people of Japan my deep personal sympathy, which I assure you is shared by all Americans, in this time of anxiety over the fate of the three Japanese aviators, Homma, Baba, and Ishita. It is our sincere hope that these courageous men may yet be found. I assure you that this Government has done and is doing its utmost to assist in the search and I pray that this search may be successful.

[His Imperial Majesty, The Emperor of Japan, Tokyo, Japan]
Note: On September 24, 1932, Kiyoshi Homma, Eiichiro Baba, and TomoyishiIshita took off from Samushiro, Japan, on a good-will flight to San Francisco. They were last reported over the Kurile Islands and were never found.
