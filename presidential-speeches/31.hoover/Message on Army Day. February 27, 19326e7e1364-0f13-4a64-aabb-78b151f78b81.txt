Message on Army Day.
[Released February 27, 1932. Dated February 15, 1932]
Dear General Delafield :
Army Day gives the nation an opportunity to express grateful appreciation to those who exposed their lives to the dangers of the battlefield and those who fell in defense of our national ideals. I wish to join in this expression and to commend the great citizen components of our military forces for their patriotic services.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Brig. Gen. John R. Delafield, Commander in Chief, Military Order of the World War, Washington, D.C. ]
