Message on Luther Day.
[Released August 13, 1932. Dated July 28, 1932]
My dear Mr. Nickelsburg:
I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to those gathered for the Bicentennial Celebration of the birth of George Washington arranged by the Lutheran Churches of the States of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and to be held at Ocean Grove, New Jersey on August 13th. The great qualities of character by reason of which George Washington towers supreme in our history were products of the Christian virtues inculcated by his deeply religious mother and devoutly practiced by him as a professed churchman. I trust that this gathering will be inspired to a new devotion to our beloved country through its exercises commemorating his birth.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. J. F. E. Nickelsburg, American Lutheran Publicity Bureau, 69 Fifth Avenue, New York City ]
