Message on National Boys' Week.
THE CELEBRATION of National Boys Week is a yearly reminder of the priceless qualities of youth, when faith is highest and ambition strongest, with their constant inspiration and encouragement to the fathers and sons. Interest in boys and comradeship with them is a privilege to their elders and a guiding service to the boys. I commend the observance of National Boys Week to all our people.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message was sent to Louis B. Mayer, Culver City, Calif. and made public in conjunction with the beginning of National Boys' Week sponsored by the Rotary International. -
