Message on National Radio Week.
[Released September 24, 1931. Dated September 16, 1931 ]
My dear Mr. Aitken:
Within a decade radio has become a major factor in our system of communication. Its results have been as far-reaching as its rise has been dramatic. As a medium for the universal dissemination of ideas it is an important factor in the formation of sound public opinion and the promotion of good citizenship. It is, in fact, an art and utility of indispensable value in our national life.
National Radio Week sponsored by the National Federation of Radio Associations and associated organizations has grown to be an event of importance, both to the industry and to the public. I shall appreciate it if you will extend my heartiest greetings to all those participating in the observance.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. James Aitken, President, National Federation of Radio Associations, 32 West Randolph St., Chicago, lll.]
