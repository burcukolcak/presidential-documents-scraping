Message on Receiving an Award From the Catholic Boys' Brigade of the United States.
My dear Father Hennrich:
Will you please express to the Catholic Boys' Brigade of the United States my warm appreciation of their sincere and helpful cooperation with the purposes of the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection, as expressed by their conferring upon me the Star Pro Juventute. It is indeed heartening to know that the Brigade, as an organization for all boys without distinction of class, color, or creed, enlists its energies in furtherance of the Children's Charter which the Conference formulated as a goal toward which all people of good will might work to bring health and happiness to all children. I am touched by this recognition of my part in this great undertaking and I ask you to take back to the Catholic Boys' Brigade U.S., my heartfelt appreciation.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Rev. Kilian J. Hennrich, O. M. Cap., Director General, Catholic Boys' Brigade U.S., 213 Stanton St., New York City]
Note: The President read the message during presentation ceremonies at the White House. Rev. Hennrich presented the award to the President.
