Message on Rosh Hashanah.
ROSH HASHANAH, the Jewish New Year, is an occasion upon which all citizens of our country may well recall with admiration and gratitude the whole-hearted loyalty and high-minded ideals of the Jewish element of our population. I felicitate them not only upon these qualities, so valuable to our civic life, but also upon their steadfast policy of furthering the cause of mutual respect and regard between the races, which is making continuous headway. And I add my best wishes for a Happy New Year.
HERBERT HOOVER
