Message on the 25th Anniversary of the National Recreation Association.
To The Boys and Girls of America:
Two and a half million of you are playing today in the playgrounds of nearly a thousand cities. Your elders rejoice with you in your fun and freckles, your sports and games and all that goes into making you happy and healthy boys and girls. Your zest in life is a precious possession and your laughter makes a joyous chorus throughout the land. Thousands of devoted men and women under the leadership of the National Recreation Association have labored for a quarter of a century to provide the playgrounds which you enjoy. We rejoice with you and with them in this boon to the boyhood and girlhood of our country.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
