Herbert Hoover
May 22, 1929

Message on the Acceptance of a Memorial Album From Belgian and French Officials Honoring Mr. Hoover's Wartime Food Relief Work.
I WOULD be grateful if you convey my appreciations to my friends in France at their meeting on May 22.
Note: The album was presented on behalf of the France-America Committee at the assemblage of French, Belgian, and American officials at the Maison des Nations Americaines in Paris. It contained the signatures of mayors and other public officials of Belgium and northern France who wished to express their [p.150] gratitude to the President for his role in the distribution of relief supplies during and after World War I.
Norman Armour, Charge d'Affaires at the American Embassy, accepted the book on behalf of the President and read the President's cablegram of appreciation.
