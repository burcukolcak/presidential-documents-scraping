Message on the Army-Navy Football Game.
[Released December 3, 1932. Dated November 21, 1932 ]
THE ARMY-NAVY Football Game is one of the great classics of amateur sport, and its revival as a regular annual event is gratifying to the entire country, which has long delighted in this particular national institution. It is gratifying to have had a part in this resumption of a yearly game dear to the hearts of Americans, my own included. I am indeed sorry that I cannot be present to congratulate the winning and to cheer the losing team.
Note: The message was printed in the program for the football game.
The military academies discontinued regular season games in 1927 but had played post-season benefit games in 1930 and 1931.
