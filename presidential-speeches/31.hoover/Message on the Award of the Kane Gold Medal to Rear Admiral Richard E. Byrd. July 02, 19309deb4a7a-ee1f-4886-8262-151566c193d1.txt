Message on the Award of the Kane Gold Medal to Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd.
I AM GLAD to learn that Kane Lodge of Masons in New York is to honor Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd with the Kane Gold Medal. It is most appropriate that these two distinguished names in the historic roll of great American Arctic explorers should be joined in honor in this award.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The President's message was sent by telegram to John Warren Hill, 72 Wall Street, New York City. The message Was read at a dinner in New York City at which Admiral Byrd was presented the medal by Attorney General William D. Mitchell.
Dr. Elisha Kent Kane was a naval physician who took part in two Arctic expeditions in 1850-51 and 1853-55.
