Message on the Award of the National Academy of Design Medal to Elihu Root.
[Released November 26, 1929. Dated November 13, 1929]
My dear Mr. Gilbert:
I am gratified to learn that the gold medal of the National Academy of Design is to be presented to the Honorable Elihu Root. His contributions to the beautification of Washington are large, and have done much to further the growing interest of the Federal Government in the fine arts as one of the great cultural influences in our country. Recognition of these services by the National Academy of Design is not only a deserved tribute to Mr. Root, but is likewise an inspiration to all who practice and all who appreciate the fine arts.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Cass Gilbert, President, National Academy of Design, 244 Madison Avenue, New York City]
