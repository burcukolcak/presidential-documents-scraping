Message on the Birthday of Thomas Jefferson and Its Celebration on Religious Holy Days.
THE NOTEWORTHY and most unusual coincidence that the religious holy days known as Palm Sunday and Passover both occur this year upon the birthday of Thomas Jefferson makes it indeed appropriate that the anniversary, on April thirteenth, is to be observed educationally and patriotically with special emphasis upon the founding of religious freedom. Jefferson's contribution, together with that of the other fathers of the Republic, to the famous Statute for Religious Freedom and his life-long championship of that principle decisively helped to fix it permanently in the national policy, with results beneficent beyond calculation. It is useful to recall these benefits and to renew their sanctions in the general conscience of mankind.
