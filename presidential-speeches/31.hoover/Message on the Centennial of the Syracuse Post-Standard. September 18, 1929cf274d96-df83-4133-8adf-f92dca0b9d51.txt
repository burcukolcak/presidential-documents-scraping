Message on the Centennial of the Syracuse Post-Standard.
[Released September 18, 1929. Dated July 25, 1929]
Dear Mr. Barnum:
I understand that on September 18th you will celebrate the anniversary of the Syracuse Post-Standard. It is indeed an occasion worthy of honor, for the Post-Standard can point with great distinction to the many, many services to the community over the century of its life. It has long since merged from a commercial enterprise into a community institution.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Jerome D. Barnum, Syracuse Post-Standard, Syracuse, N.Y.]
