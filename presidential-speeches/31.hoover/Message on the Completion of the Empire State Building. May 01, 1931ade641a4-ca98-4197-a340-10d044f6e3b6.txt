Message on the Completion of the Empire State Building.
[Released May 1, 1931. Dated April 29, 1931]
I MOST CORDIALLY congratulate you and your associates upon the completion of the Empire State Building and the opening of its doors to the service of the public. This achievement justifies pride of accomplishment in everyone who has had any part in its conception and construction and it must long remain one of the outstanding glories of a great city.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message was read at ceremonies opening the Empire State Building in New York City. During the ceremonies, the President turned on the lights in the building by touching a golden telegraph key in the White House.
The message was sent to Alfred E. Smith, former Governor of New York and president of the Empire State Corporation.
