Message on the Completion of the Greenspan Brothers Warehouse.
I HEARTILY congratulate you upon the completion of the valuable new structure you are dedicating this evening, and even more do I congratulate your community and the Nation upon such an example of vision and of faith in the country as are evidenced by this undertaking which has brought work to artisans in factories and on the construction job and thereby contributed to better times for all.
