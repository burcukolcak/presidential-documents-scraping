Message on the Death of David N. Mosessohn.
I AM shocked to learn of the death of my friend Dr. David N. Mosessohn. His distinguished contributions to Jewish culture and his outstanding leadership in service of the noblest ethical ideals will cause him long to be remembered gratefully by his fellow countrymen of all races and creeds.
