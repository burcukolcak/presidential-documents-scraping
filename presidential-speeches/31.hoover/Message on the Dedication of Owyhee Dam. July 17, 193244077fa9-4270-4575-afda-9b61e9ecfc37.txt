Message on the Dedication of Owyhee Dam.
[Released July 17, 1932. Dated July 16, 1932]
I SEND CORDIAL greetings and my hearty congratulations to all those in attendance at the dedication exercises commemorating the completion of the highest dam in the world, the Owyhee. It is another great monument to the skill of American engineers. It will exercise a permanently stabilizing effect on your community through knowledge that the necessary element to success, a sufficient water supply at all times, has been supplied. The sympathy of the administration and the Congress and the whole-hearted and fine spirit of the people of this community have cooperated to make the completion of this dam possible.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. Ray Lyman Wilbur, c/o Frank A. Banks, Engineer in Charge, U.S. Reclamation Service, Owyhee, Oregon]
Note: Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur read the message at dedication ceremonies for the dam, located on the Snake River in Oregon.
