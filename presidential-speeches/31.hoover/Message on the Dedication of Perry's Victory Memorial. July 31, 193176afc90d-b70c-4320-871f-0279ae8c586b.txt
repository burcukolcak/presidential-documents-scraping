Message on the Dedication of Perry's Victory Memorial.
[Released July 31, 1931. Dated July 29, 1931 ]
THE DEDICATION of the Perry's Victory Memorial to commemorate the victory of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry and his men in the battle of Lake Erie, and an enduring peace between English-speaking peoples, is an event of more than national interest and significance. This memorial to the valour of Commodore Perry's men, and indeed, to the heroism of the combatants on both sides, also commemorates a pioneer step in the maintenance of peace through disarmament. The Rush Bagot Treaty which followed this war provided for the permanent limitation of armaments maintained by the two nations on the Great Lakes. It stands not only as a symbol of victory at arms, but marks the establishment for the first time in history of the principle of disarmament in the policy of nations as a preventive of war. It is particularly appropriate that a tablet reproducing the Rush-Bagot agreement should be unveiled at the dedication. It comes at a time when the nations of the world are seeking solution of their common problems through cooperation and disarmament. It is my happy privilege on behalf of our nation to congratulate the Commission.
