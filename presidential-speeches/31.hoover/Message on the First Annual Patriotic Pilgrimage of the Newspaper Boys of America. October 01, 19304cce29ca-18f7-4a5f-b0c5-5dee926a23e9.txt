Message on the First Annual Patriotic Pilgrimage of the Newspaper Boys of America.
[Released October 1, 1930. Dated May 21, 1930]
Dear Mr. Shelton:
I have read with interest the plan for the First Annual Patriotic Pilgrimage of the Newspaper Boys of America. Such a plan, providing for the cooperation of the newspapers of the country generally, gives promise both of a fine recognition of character and enterprise amongst the boys and of a valuable step in their education in patriotism and government.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. William C. Shelton, The Times Boys Club, Washington, D.C.]
Note: The First Annual Patriotic Pilgrimage of the Newspaper Boys of America was an outgrowth of a December 1929 incident at the White House in which carrier boys sang carols to President and Mrs. Hoover. The pilgrimage was organized by Mr. Shelton of the Washington Times and became an annual affair featuring 3 days of sightseeing, a parade and banquet, and a Presidential reception on Christmas Day. Participants were selected, and expenses paid, by cooperating newspapers.
