Message on the Opening of the 12th Exposition of Chemical Industries.
[Released May 6, 1929. Dated April 25, 1929]
My dear Dr. Little:
I thank you cordially for your invitation to attend the opening of the Twelfth Exposition of Chemical Industries on May 6th at the Grand Central Palace, New York.
I am sorry that the pressure of public business will make it impossible for me to accept. However, I sympathize so strongly with the purpose of such expositions that I wish you would kindly convey the following message from me on that occasion:
"The chemical industries are among the foremost of those that ally themselves continuously with workers in pure science, and thereby quickly transform discoveries of creative research into practical products for human use. The fact that your Exposition equally interests chemists, engineers and manufacturers symbolizes this close bond, so desirable in all industry. I wish you all success."
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Dr. Arthur D. Little, Chairman, Advisory Committee, Twelfth Exposition of Chemical Industries, Grand Central Palace, New York City]
