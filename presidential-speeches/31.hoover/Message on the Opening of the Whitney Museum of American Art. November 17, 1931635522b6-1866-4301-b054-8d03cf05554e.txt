Message on the Opening of the Whitney Museum of American Art.
[Released November 17, 1931. Dated November 10, 1931]
My dear Mrs. Whitney:
I profoundly regret that the pressure of imperative public duties prevents my accepting your kind invitation to speak at the opening of the Whitney Museum of American Art. It is an enterprise which makes a strong appeal to my own interest and I am sure that this permanent, pioneer museum devoted exclusively to American paintings and sculpture will appeal to the country as a benefaction of nation-wide interest. It is a promising step toward placing American art in the position of importance and dignity which its excellence and individuality merit. It should quicken our national sense of beauty and increase America's pride in her own culture. Please accept for yourself my heartiest congratulations on the consummation of your plans and the appreciation which I know every American must feel for so notable a contribution to the nation.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney, Whitney Museum of American Art, 10 West Eighth Street, New York City]
