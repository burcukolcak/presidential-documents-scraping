My dear Mr. Bridgman:
The award of the Gold Medal of the Mining and Metallurgical Society of America to Mr. Cornelius F. Kelley is a deserved tribute to his outstanding achievements in the mining profession. His life of usefulness has contributed in high degree to the stabilization of mining in the United States and has helped bring about its public recognition as a dependable industry. I take more than usual pleasure in extending my congratulations to Mr. Kelley and to the Society.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
