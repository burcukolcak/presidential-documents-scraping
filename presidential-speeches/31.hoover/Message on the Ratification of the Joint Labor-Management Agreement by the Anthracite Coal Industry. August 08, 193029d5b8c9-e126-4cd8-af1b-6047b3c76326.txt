Message on the Ratification of the Joint Labor-Management Agreement by the Anthracite Coal Industry.
Dear Mr. Secretary:
Will you convey my personal congratulations to the representatives of the operators and miners assembled at Scranton this evening for the formal signing of the new five and one-half year joint agreement in the anthracite field. The final ratification and signing of this agreement comprehends that spirit of joint relationship and cooperation between management and men so essential in productive endeavor, and, especially, in the anthracite industry.
That you may look forward to a period of uninterrupted peace for more than five years will be very gratifying not only to those directly engaged in the mining and selling of anthracite coal, but, as well, to the public at large, the government, and all who are genuinely interested in the well-being and advancement of the anthracite industry.
This pact of peace will have beneficial effects upon transportation, manufacturing, and other business activities which are indirectly affected by conditions in this particular industry. The example set by you is commendatory and will go a long way toward stimulating that spirit of good will and cooperation so necessary in the conduct of our great industrial enterprises.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable James J. Davis, Secretary of Labor, Washington]
