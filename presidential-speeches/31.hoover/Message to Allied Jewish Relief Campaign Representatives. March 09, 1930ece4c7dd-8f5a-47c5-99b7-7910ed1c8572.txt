Message to Allied Jewish Relief Campaign Representatives.
[Released March 9, 1930. Dated March 8, 1930]
Dear Mr. Warburg:

I understand that you and your colleagues of many years are gathered here in Washington to take counsel among yourselves for the continuance of the great and unselfish work in which you have been so long engaged and in the course of which so much devotion and so many millions have been expended.
The sad circumstances of the last few hours which have plunged the Nation into mourning make it impossible for me to welcome you other than with these lines.
I can only repeat what I have so often said to you before that the work which you have done, apart from its evident humanitarian aspects, is a large contribution to the cause of good-will between peoples. History will properly appraise your efforts for posterity--the commendation of your own consciences for today.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message was sent to Felix Warburg.
The President had intended to personally greet the 800 representatives of Jewish groups from the United States and Canada who had convened in Washington, D.C., to form an allied Jewish campaign to raise $6 million for reconstruction in Eastern Europe and for use in Palestine. White House social functions and public appearances were canceled upon the announcement of the death of William Howard Taft.
