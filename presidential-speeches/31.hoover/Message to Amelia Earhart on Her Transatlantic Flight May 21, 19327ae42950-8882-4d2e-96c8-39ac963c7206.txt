Message to Amelia Earhart on Her Transatlantic Flight
I VOICE the pride of the Nation in congratulating you most heartily upon achieving the splendid pioneer solo flight by a woman across the Atlantic Ocean. You have demonstrated not only your own dauntless courage but also the capacity of women to match the skill of men in carrying through the most difficult feats of high adventure.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Amelia Earhart Putnam, Culmore, Ireland]
Note: Mrs. Amelia Earhart Putnam became the first woman to complete a trans-atlantic solo flight. She flew from Harbor Grace, Newfoundland, to Culmore, Ireland, in the record time of 14 hours and 56 minutes.
