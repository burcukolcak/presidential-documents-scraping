Message to Ceremonies Honoring George B. Cortelyou.
[Released May 25, 1932. Dated May 18, 1932]
My dear Mr. Cortelyou:
I am gratified to learn that the American Museum of Safety is to present its "Certificate of Appreciation" to you, in recognition of one phase of your many outstanding services to the public since your entrance into private business twenty-one years ago. I have long held that the Federal Government evoked a type of socially-minded service of exceptional unselfishness and breadth of vision, and your distinguished record in Washington, followed by many achievements of like color in civil life, should be a stimulus to others as well as a profound satisfaction to yourself.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER

[Hon. George B. Cortelyou, President, Consolidated Gas Company, New York City]
