Message to Ceremonies Honoring Julius Rosenwald.
[Released September 8, 1931. Dated September 4, 1931]
My dear Mr. Sargent:
The Merit Awards sponsored by the Rotary Club of Chicago for distinguished public service by residents of that community, are not only appropriate recognition of usefulness but are an incentive to citizens to contribute to the common good through unselfish personal service. I regret that I was unable on account of the pressure of the public business, to accept your kind invitation to attend the presentation of the first of these awards on September 8th. I shall appreciate it if you will express my cordial good wishes to those gathered for the occasion and my hearty congratulations to Mr. Julius Rosenwald, the recipient of the premier award.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Fred W. Sargent, Rotary Club of Chicago, Hotel Sherman, Chicago, Ill.]
Note: The message was read at a luncheon honoring Julius Rosenwald with the first of three annual merit awards. Due to ill health Mr. Rosenwald was unable to attend the luncheon, but a scroll summarizing his achievements was accepted by his son Lessing J. Rosenwald.
