Message to Emperor Hirohito of Japan on a Washington Visit of Japanese Delegates to the London Naval Conference.
BOTH Mrs. Hoover and I were very happy to have Mr. Wakatsuki and the other members of the Japanese Delegation as our guests and we are gratified to learn that their visit to our Capital city was a pleasant one. The American Delegates to the London Conference were most pleased to meet their fellow Japanese Delegates and look forward to reciprocal and hearty cooperation in their coming mission.

[His Majesty Hirohito, Emperor of Japan, Tokyo]
Note: Reijiro Wakatsuki was chairman of the Japanese delegation to the London Naval Conference. During their visit, the Japanese delegates attended two meetings with the American delegates to discuss points of view relating to the Conference.
