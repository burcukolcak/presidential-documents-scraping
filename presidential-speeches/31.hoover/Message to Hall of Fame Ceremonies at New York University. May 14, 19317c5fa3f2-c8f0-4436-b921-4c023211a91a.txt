Message to Hall of Fame Ceremonies at New York University.
[Released May 14, 1931. Dated May 12, 1931]
My dear Dr. Johnson:
I am deeply interested to learn of the unveiling of busts in the Hall of Fame in recognition of the enduring quality of the works of President Monroe, Maury the scientist, Whistler the artist and Whitman the poet. Naturally my first interest is in my great predecessor, whose enunciation of the Monroe Doctrine was conceived in the friendliest spirit toward the struggling republics of Latin America and which has formed the firm foundation upon which has steadily grown an ever-increasing mutual respect and good will between our own country and these advancing nations to the south of us. It has been one of the great satisfactions of my tenure of the Presidency that it has given opportunity for this Administration in many ways to show its deep sympathy with and interest in the well being of our sister republics.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable Robert Underwood Johnson, Director, Hall of Fame, New York University, 26 East 55th Street, New York City]
