Message to King Alfonso XIII on the Inauguration of Direct Radiotelegraphic Service With Spain.
I TAKE the opportunity of the opening of direct radiotelegraphic service with your country to send you my cordial greetings and my congratulations on the brilliant success which has thus far attended the International Expositions at Seville and Barcelona.
Through this new means of communication we are brought to the realization that our countries are united more closely each day by an intimate acquaintance between the two peoples.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Majesty Alfonso XIII, King of Spain, Madrid]
