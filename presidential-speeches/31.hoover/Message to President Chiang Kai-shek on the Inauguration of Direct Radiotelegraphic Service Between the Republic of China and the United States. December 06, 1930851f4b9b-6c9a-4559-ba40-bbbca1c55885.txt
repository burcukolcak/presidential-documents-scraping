Message to President Chiang Kai-shek on the Inauguration of Direct Radiotelegraphic Service Between the Republic of China and the United States.
TODAY DIRECT radio service is being inaugurated between China and the United States. This added development in the means of communication between countries which are as widely separated as ours will, I trust, serve to bring them closer together in the minds and thoughts of our peoples and will to that extent and in that manner contribute toward a better mutual understanding.
With this thought in mind, I send to Your Excellency and to the people of China my most cordial wishes for the increasing prosperity of your country.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency Chiang Kai-shek, President of the National Government of the Republic of China, Nanking, China]
