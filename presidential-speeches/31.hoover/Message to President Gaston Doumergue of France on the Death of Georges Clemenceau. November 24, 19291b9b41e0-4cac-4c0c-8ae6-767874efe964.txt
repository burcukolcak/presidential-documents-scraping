Message to President Gaston Doumergue of France on the Death of Georges Clemenceau.
CLEMENCEAU was a great patriot. His unselfish love of country inspired his fellow men. He was a valiant advocate of peace who knew how to meet nobly the tragedy of war. His death, which brings mourning to France, is deeply regretted by men of good will in all nations. I send you, Mr. President, this expression of my profound sympathy and that of the American people.
