Message to President Gaston Doumergue of France on the Transatlantic Flight of the French Plane Yellow Bird.
UPON the occasion of the magnificent flight across the Atlantic by your compatriots I wish to extend to you and to the French people, as well as to the aviators themselves, my sincere congratulations and an expression of my admiration of their gallantry.
Note: Three French aviators and a stowaway flew in the monoplane Yellow Bird nonstop from Old Orchard, Maine, to a beach near Comillas, Spain, in 29 hours 52 minutes.
