Message to President Pascual Ortiz Rubio of Mexico on the Death of Emilio Cortes Rubio.
I HAVE just learned with deep regret of the report that two Mexican students, one of them a relative of Your Excellency, were killed this morning at Ardmore, Oklahoma. I have ordered a minute investigation of the circumstances of this profoundly regrettable incident.

Note: On June 7, 1931, Emilio Cortes Rubio, cousin of Mexican President Ortiz Rubio, and his companion Manuel Garcia Gomez were shot and killed by deputy sheriffs in Ardmore, Okla. Murder charges were filed but at the trial, the responsible police officer was acquitted.
