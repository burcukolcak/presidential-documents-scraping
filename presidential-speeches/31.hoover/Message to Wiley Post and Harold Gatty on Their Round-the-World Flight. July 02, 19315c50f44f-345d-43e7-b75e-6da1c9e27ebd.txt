Message to Wiley Post and Harold Gatty on Their Round-the-World Flight.
YOUR SUCCESSFUL world girdling flight is a striking contribution to aeronautical progress. It is dramatic testimony to the efficiency and reliability of American aircraft. It demonstrates vividly how modern science is making neighbors of all the nations of the world. All America is proud of you in the hour of your extraordinary success. You have enhanced faith in the art of flying and the science of air navigation. I congratulate you most heartily on your achievement. I look forward with pleasure to seeing you at the White House next Monday.
