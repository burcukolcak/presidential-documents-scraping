[Released January 10, 1933. Dated December 10, 1932]
I WILL BE OBLIGED if you will express my cordial greetings to those gathered at the Save the Children meeting this evening, and my deep sense of the value of this work in behalf of childhood. Now, more than ever, we must be profoundly concerned to conserve these precious human values which are the hope and the promise of the future of the world.
