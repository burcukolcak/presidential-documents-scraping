My dear Miss Bissell:
I am glad to learn that the Kiwanis Club of Wilmington is awarding you its medal for Distinguished Community Service, in recognition of your long and invaluable contributions of thought and spirit and labor to the work of the American Red Cross and the National Tuberculosis Association. This is indeed a fitting acknowledgement of a lifetime of devotion to the cause of humanity.

Yours faithfully,
