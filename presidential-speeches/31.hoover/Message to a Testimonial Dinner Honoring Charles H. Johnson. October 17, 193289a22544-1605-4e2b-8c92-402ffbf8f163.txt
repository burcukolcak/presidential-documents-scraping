Message to a Testimonial Dinner Honoring Charles H. Johnson.
[Released October 17, 1932. Dated October 6, 1932]
My dear Mr. Ridder:
I am deeply interested to learn of the testimonial dinner to Dr. Charles H. Johnson to be held on October 17th. This is a deserved recognition of his many years of faithful and fruitful service in works of social welfare. I recall his splendid services with me in American relief in Russia and I wish to add my tribute of admiration and my best wishes to those which will be showered upon him.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Victor F. Ridder, Chairman, The Charles H. Johnson Testimonial Dinner Committee, N.Y. State Department of Social Welfare, Albany, New York]
