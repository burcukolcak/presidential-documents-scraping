Message to a Testimonial Dinner Honoring David A. Brown.
PLEASE EXTEND to the Citizens' Committee for the Testimonial Dinner to David A. Brown my sincere regrets that I cannot participate in person and express the good-will and regard which your distinguished guest so well deserves.
Over a period of many years I have known of the large range of civic, patriotic and humanitarian activities of Mr. Brown. In a number [p.151] of these movements I have enjoyed his close association, especially in his efforts for the relief of war sufferers in many lands. He has rendered noteworthy contribution to the well-being and happiness of many peoples. I greatly admire his outstanding services in the fund raising activity of the Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. He has been at all times inspired by unselfish ideals and he has succeeded to a remarkable degree in stimulating the generous activities of others.
With my greetings and good wishes to Mr. Brown, I am,
Faithfully yours,
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message was read at the dinner in New York City by D. M. Bressler, Chairman of the Citizens' Committee.
