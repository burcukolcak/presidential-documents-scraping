Message to the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce of America.
[Released April 11, 1931. Dated April 10, 1931]
PLEASE CONVEY to the members of the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce my hope that the conferences and exposition which open today will contribute to the substantial development of the aircraft industry. As I indicated to the delegation representing your body on March fifth, it is my great desire to see commercial aviation established on the right basis. This can best come through air transport and after air transport through business and private flying.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Charles L. Lawrance, President, Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce of America, Inc., Book-Cadillac Hotel, Detroit, Michigan]
Note: The message was read at a luncheon opening the National Air Show for 1931. The exposition was held at Detroit's Municipal Airport.
