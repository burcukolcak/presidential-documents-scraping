Message to the Affiliated Better Business Bureaus Conference.
[Released September 9, 1932. Dated September 6, 1932]
My dear Mr. Riehl:
I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the National Convention of the Affiliated Better Business Bureaus. Every organization sincerely working to advance the cause of truth in advertising is definitely contributing to the security and enlargement of business enterprise. Likewise, every organization working to clean up and keep clean the security issues offered to the public is contributing to the economic stability and progress of the country. All such efforts deserve commendation and general public support.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Harry Riehl, President, Affiliated Better Business Bureaus, Inc., DeshlerWallick Hotel, Columbus, Ohio]
