Message to the American Artists Professional League.
[Released October 31, 1932. Dated October 25, 1932]
My dear Mr. Reid:
The sittings given by me to portrait artists during the last three years have been granted at the request of various organizations and groups who wished to have a portrait of the President. In each case, these groups have selected the artists by whom they themselves wished to have the portraits executed. There have been no portraits made as yet on my own order for my own use. I appreciate your friendly interest.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Albert T. Reid, National Vice Chairman, The American Artists Professional League, 103 Park Ave., New York City]
Note: The President's message, subsequently printed in an issue of Art Digest, was in response to a protest from the league that foreign artists had exploited the Chief Executive to enhance their own prestige. Particular reference was made to portraits done by Philip de Laszlo, Philides Costa, Joseph Sigall, and Douglas Chandor. According to the league, Raymond Adams had been the only American to paint the President's portrait.
