Message to the American Bar Association on Constitution Day.
[Released September 15, 1930. Dated September 12, 1930]
My dear Mr. Marvel:
I am glad to learn of the splendid work which the American Bar Association is doing in promoting among our fellow citizens more accurate knowledge of, and greater respect for, the National Constitution.
There has never been a time when the advantages of this great charter of government stood out more clearly against the background of world events than it does today.
As September 17th is the anniversary of the day upon which the Constitution of the United States was signed, this date has been designated as Constitution Day, and it is indeed fitting that this anniversary should be appropriately observed in all parts of our Nation.
I strongly value the services which you and your associates are rendering, and do commend to our fellow citizens the opportunity so appropriately afforded to refresh their appreciative understanding of the Constitution.

Faithfully yours,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable Josiah Marvel, President, American Bar Association, Chicago, Illinois]
