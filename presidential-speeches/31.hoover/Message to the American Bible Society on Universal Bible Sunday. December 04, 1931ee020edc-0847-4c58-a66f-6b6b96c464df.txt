Message to the American Bible Society on Universal Bible Sunday.
[Released December 4, 1931. Dated November 25, 1931]
My dear Mr. Brown:
I am interested to know that December 6th is to be observed as Universal Bible Sunday. Our institutions and common life are grounded in spiritual ideals. I hope that the observation of Bible Sunday will quicken the spiritual impulses of our people and contribute to the spiritual advancement which underlies our stability, service and progress as a nation and as individuals.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. George W. Brown, General Secretary, American Bible Society, Bible House, Astor Place, New York City]
