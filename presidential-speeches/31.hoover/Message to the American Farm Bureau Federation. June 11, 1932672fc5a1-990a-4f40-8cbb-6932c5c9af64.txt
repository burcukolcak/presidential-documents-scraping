Message to the American Farm Bureau Federation.
[Released June 11, 1932. Dated June 6, 1932]
THE FOURTH OF JULY celebrations conducted by the American Farm Bureau Federation have a special significance in this George Washington bicentennial year, for through them the farmers of the Nation will pay homage to that great farmer who was also the father of our institutions and more than any other man the author of our form of government. I am glad to commend these celebrations and to urge the widest possible participation in them.
Note: The organization released the message in conjunction with pre-celebration publicity.
