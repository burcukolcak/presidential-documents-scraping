Message to the American Palestine Committee.
[Released January 17, 1932. Dated January 11, 1932 ]
My dear Mr. Neumann :
I am interested to learn that a group of distinguished men and women is to be formed to spread knowledge and appreciation of the rehabilitation which is going forward in Palestine under Jewish auspices, and to add my expression to the sentiment among our people in favor of the realization of the age-old aspirations of the Jewish people for the restoration of their national homeland. I shall appreciate it if you will present my cordial greetings to those attending the dinner in Washington on January 17th to advance this enterprise.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
