Message to the American Trade Association Executives.
[Released September 15, 1932. Dated September 13, 1932]
My dear Mr. Hays:
I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the American Trade Association Executives. Their organized attack upon such problems as the spreading of employment, reduction of selling costs, modernization of plant equipment, active search for new products and new markets, adoption of more liberal credit policies, and a score of other forward looking measures, offers a constructive opportunity for the leaders and spokesmen of organized business to secure further advances in the struggle for economic recovery.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Warner S. Hays, President, American Trade Association Executives, Ambassador Hotel, Atlantic City, N.J. ]
Note: The message was read at the annual convention which met in Atlantic City, N.J.
