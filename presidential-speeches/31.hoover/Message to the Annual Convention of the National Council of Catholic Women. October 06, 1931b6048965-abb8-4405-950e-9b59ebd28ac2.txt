Message to the Annual Convention of the National Council of Catholic Women.
[Released October 6, 1931. Dated October 5, 1931]
My dear Miss Hawks:
I shall be greatly obliged to you if you will present my cordial greetings to the delegates to the annual convention of the National Council of Catholic Women in session here. The National Capital delights to welcome the representatives of a nation-wide organization whose activities mean so much to the cause of good citizenship, the preservation of family life, the care of the unfortunate and the enrichment of the spiritual life and ideals of our people. I trust that your meeting may advance the sound objectives for which your organization so nobly stands.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Miss Mary G. Hawks, President, National Council of Catholic Women, Hotel Mayflower, Washington, D.C.]
