Message to the Annual Convention of the Zionist Organization of America.
[Released June 30, 1929. Dated June 27, 1929]
My dear Mr. Slomovitz:
Please say for me to the members of the Zionist Organization of America, gathered in annual convention at Detroit on June 30th, that I pray [p.206] their deliberations may be, as always, richly fruitful in that spiritual wisdom for which the Jewish race has been noteworthy in all ages.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Philip Slomovitz, President of the Zionist District of Detroit, Detroit, Michigan]
