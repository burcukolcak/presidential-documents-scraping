Message to the Annual Dinner of the Society of the Genesee Honoring Edward Bausch.
[Released January 9, 1933. Dated January 3, 1933]
THE ANNUAL DINNERS of the Society of the Genesee represent in high degree the expression of a sentiment typically American. Our native individualism often carries us far from our early haunts, but by such gatherings as yours we recall the scenes of our youth and enshrine our early homes in happy memory. As long as we maintain this contact with the past we maintain the continuity of American tradition. I send my best wishes to the Society of the Genesee and my congratulations to your guest of honor, Edward Bausch of Rochester.

Note: The message was sent to Louis Wiley, founder of the organization, and was made public in conjunction with the announcement of the society's 34th annual dinner to be held at the Hotel Commodore in New York City on January 23, 1933.
Dr. Bausch, president of Bausch and Lomb Optical Co., was honored for his contribution to science through the development and manufacture of the microscope.
