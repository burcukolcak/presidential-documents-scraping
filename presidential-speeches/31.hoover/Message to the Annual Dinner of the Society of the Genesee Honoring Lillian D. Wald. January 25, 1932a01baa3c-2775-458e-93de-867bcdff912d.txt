[Released January 25, 1932. Dated January 19, 1932]
My dear Mr. Wiley:
Please convey to the Society of the Genesee, and to its guest of honor, my felicitations on its thirty-third annual dinner. Miss Lillian D. Wald's untiring efforts in the amelioration of human suffering have rightly earned her the approbation of her fellow-citizens. The Geneseens have cause for pride in numbering Miss Wald among their company. Her position in our national life is unique. Her life has been marked by steadfastness and courage. My best wishes attend the success of the dinner and of the Society.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Louis Wiley, Chairman, Board of Governors, Society of the Genesee, The New York Times, 229 West 43rd Street, New York City]
