Message to the Annual Safety Congress of the National Safety Council.
[Released October 12, 1931. Dated September 24, 1931]
My dear Mr. Bergquist:
Although substantial progress has been made in diminishing industrial accident rates, one cannot complacently contemplate the fact that there are still 99,000 accidental deaths a year in the United States as well as a vast number of injuries. There is clearly a tremendous field still for organized efforts to promote accident prevention, especially in the home and on the highways, and to a considerable extent in industry, in spite of a decrease of one-third in industrial accidents in the past two decades. The fact that there are 33,000 motor vehicle deaths annually in the United States is a challenge to the efforts of safety organizations and the cooperation of every motor-vehicle operator. The National Safety Council renders a conspicuously important service in promoting safety measures. Please present to its members gathered for the annual Safety Congress in Chicago my congratulations on their achievements. I trust that the meeting may be conducive to still greater effort to safeguard human life and property.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. C. W. Bergquist, President, National Safety Council, Chicago, Ill.]
