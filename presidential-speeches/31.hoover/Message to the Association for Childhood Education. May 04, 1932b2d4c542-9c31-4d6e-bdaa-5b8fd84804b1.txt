Message to the Association for Childhood Education.
[Released May 4, 1932. Dated May 2, 1932]
My dear Miss Abbot:
I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the Convention of the Association for Childhood Education, and my warm appreciation of their devoted work in behalf of the young children of our Nation. What they shall become will determine the character of our civilization and will shape the course of our national destiny. No more sacred obligation rests on us than to see that they are equipped to meet their responsibilities with sound bodies, developed minds and high ideals.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Miss Julia Wade Abbot, President, Association for Childhood Education, 1201 Sixteenth Street N.W., Washington, D.C.]
