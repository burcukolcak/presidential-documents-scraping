Message to the Association of Community Chests and Councils.
THE MAGNIFICENT response of the American people to the present Community Chest campaign is characteristic of the generous impulse and friendly spirit of social cooperation and good will which is one of the most powerful constructive forces in our democracy. This movement is wisely conceived and administered, and deserves the support of all our people.
HERBERT HOOVER
