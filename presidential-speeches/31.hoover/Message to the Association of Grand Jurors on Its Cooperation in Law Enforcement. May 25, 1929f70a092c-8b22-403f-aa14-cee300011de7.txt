Message to the Association of Grand Jurors on Its Cooperation in Law Enforcement.
[Released May 25, 1929. Dated May 18, 1929]
My dear Mr. Appleton:
I have your kind letter of May 9th. I wish to express my appreciation of the organized support you are giving to the enforcement of law and the interest you are taking in improvement of the judiciary.
The cooperation of your association with the Law Enforcement Commission which will soon be appointed, will be most helpful.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT Hoover
