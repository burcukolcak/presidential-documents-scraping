Message to the Atlantic Deeper Waterways Association Convention.
[Released September 20, 1929. Dated August 29, 1929]
My dear Mr. Moore:
I have your kind letter of August 26th.
I should be glad if you would express to the convention my continued deep interest in the development of our waterways. The growth of our country requires incessant labor on the part of both federal and state authorities in the improvement of this essential basis of transportation. The Federal Government is expanding its activities in these directions, and I am resolved that it shall be unremitting in waterway development.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. J. Hampton Moore, President, Atlantic Deeper Waterways Association, 1405 Widener Building, Philadelphia, Pa.]
Note: The message was read at the convention held in Troy, New York.
