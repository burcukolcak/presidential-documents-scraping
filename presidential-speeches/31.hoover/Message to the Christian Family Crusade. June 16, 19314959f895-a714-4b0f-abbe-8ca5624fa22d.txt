Message to the Christian Family Crusade.

My dear Mr. Holderby:

The importance of the family as the unit for spiritual and social progress, and the spiritual values of family life, cannot be overestimated. Anything which strengthens the family and gives a deeper significance to family life is salutary, not only for the family but for the nation. This was recognized in the deliberations of the recent White House Conference on Child Health and Protection.
You have no doubt noted that one of the first rights of the child as set forth in the Children's Charter adopted by the Conference was "for every child spiritual and moral training to help him to stand firm under the pressure of life." This Charter also emphasizes the importance of training for parents, "to fit them to deal wisely with the problems of parenthood."

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
