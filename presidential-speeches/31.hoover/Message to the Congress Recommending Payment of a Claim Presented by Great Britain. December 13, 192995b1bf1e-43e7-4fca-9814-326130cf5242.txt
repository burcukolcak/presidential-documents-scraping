Message to the Congress Recommending Payment of a Claim Presented by Great Britain.
To the Congress of the United States:
I enclose a report received from the Secretary of State requesting the submission anew to the present Congress of the claim presented by the Government of Great Britain for the death, on November 1, 1921, at Consuelo, Dominican Republic, of Samuel Richardson, a British subject, as a result of a bullet wound inflicted presumably by a member of the United States Marine Corps, which formed the subject of a report made by the Secretary of State to the President on December 13, 1927, and the President's message to the Congress dated September 17, 1927, which are published as Senate Document No. 21, Seventieth Congress, First session. Copies of this are furnished for the full information of the Congress.
I concur in the recommendation made by the Secretary of State and recommend that, as an act of grace and without reference to the question of the legal liability of the United States in the matter, the Congress authorize an appropriation in the sum of $1,000.00 in order to effect a settlement of this claim. In bringing the matter anew to the attention of the present Congress I hope that the action recommended may receive favorable consideration.
