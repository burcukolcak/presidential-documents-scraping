Message to the Congress Recommending Payment of a Claim Presented by the Government of China.
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State requesting the submission to the Congress of a claim presented by the Government of China against the Government of the United States, arising out of a collision in Chinese waters on June 2, 1927, between the United States naval vessel Bittern and a Chinese junk, resulting in the drowning of Chang Hsi Ying, a citizen of China, and a member of the crew of the junk.
I recommend that, as an act of grace and without reference to the question of the legal liability of the United States, an appropriation in the amount of $500 be made to effect settlement of this claim in accordance with the recommendation of the Secretary of State, in which the Secretary of the Navy concurs.
