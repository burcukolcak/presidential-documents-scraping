Message to the Congress Recommending Payment of a Claim Presented by the Polish Government.
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith a report from the Acting Secretary of State in regard to a claim presented by the Polish Government for the reimbursement of certain expenditures incurred by the community authorities of Rzeczyczany, Poland, to which place an insane alien was erroneously deported. The conclusion reached by the Acting Secretary of State has my approval and I recommend that the Congress authorize an appropriation of $152.35 to be paid to the Polish Government.
