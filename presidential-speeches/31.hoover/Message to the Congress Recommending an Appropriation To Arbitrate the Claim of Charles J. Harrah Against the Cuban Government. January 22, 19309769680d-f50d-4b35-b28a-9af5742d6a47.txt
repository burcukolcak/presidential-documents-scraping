Message to the Congress Recommending an Appropriation To Arbitrate the Claim of Charles J. Harrah Against the Cuban Government.
To the Congress of the United States:
On October 31, 1929, I submitted to the Congress a report of the Secretary of State in regard to the claim of Charles J. Harrah, an American citizen, against the Government of Cuba, growing out of the destruction in 1917, of a railroad built and operated by him in the Province of Habana.
In submitting the report mentioned, I recommended that an appropriation in the amount of $20,000 be made in order that the expenses which it would be necessary to incur on the part of the Government of the United States to prosecute the Harrah claim to settlement by arbitration might be met. I submit herewith a supplementary report of the Secretary of State, from which it will be observed that, in the light of developments in the arbitration proceedings to date, the amount previously mentioned will not be sufficient to meet the necessary expenses of the arbitration and that $20,000 additional will be required.
I recommend that an appropriation of $40,000 to provide for the costs of arbitrating the Harrah claim be made instead of $20,000, as previously recommended.
