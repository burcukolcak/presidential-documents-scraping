Message to the Congress Recommending payment of a Claim Presented by a Chinese Citizen.
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith a report of the Acting Secretary of State requesting the submission to the Congress of a claim against the Navy Department submitted through the American consul at Nanking in behalf of Li Ying-ting, a citizen of China, for the deaths of four members of the claimant's family resulting from a collision between the claimant's junk and the United States naval vessel Hart on the Yangtze River on July 3, 1925.
I recommend that, as an act of grace and without reference to the question of the legal liability of the United States, an appropriation of $1,500 United States currency be authorized to effect settlement of this claim, in accordance with the recommendations of the Acting Secretary of the Navy and the Acting Secretary of State.
