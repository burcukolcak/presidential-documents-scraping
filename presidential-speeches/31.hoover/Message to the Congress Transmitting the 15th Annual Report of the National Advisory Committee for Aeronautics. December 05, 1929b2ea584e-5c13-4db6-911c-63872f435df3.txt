Message to the Congress Transmitting the 15th Annual Report of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.
To the Congress of the United States:
In compliance with the provisions of the act of March 3, 1915, establishing the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, I submit herewith the Fifteenth Annual Report of the Committee for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1929.
It is evident from the Committee's report that, although material progress has been made in aeronautics during the past year, the best efforts of America are needed to keep pace with other progressive nations in the rapidly developing science of aeronautics. Attention is invited to part V of the Committee's report presenting a summary of the progress in aircraft development, and especially to the conclusion, wherein the Committee expresses certain opinions with reference to the relative position of the United States and other nations that are active in the development of aeronautics.
I concur in the Committee's opinion that progress on the two outstanding problems of increased safety and decreased costs necessitates continuous scientific research on the fundamental problems of flight. To this end enlarged facilities are being provided at the Committee's laboratories at Langley Field, Virginia.
It is gratifying to note the Committee's opinion that the efforts of all agencies, governmental and private, concerned with the technical [p.457] development of aircraft are effectively coordinated in prosecuting the research programs of the Committee.
