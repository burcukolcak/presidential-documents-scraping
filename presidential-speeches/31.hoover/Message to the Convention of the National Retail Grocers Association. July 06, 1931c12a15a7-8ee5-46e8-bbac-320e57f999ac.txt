Message to the Convention of the National Retail Grocers Association.
[Released July 6, 1931. Dated June 30, 1931]
My dear Mr. Janssen:
I am interested to learn of the thirty-fourth annual convention of the National Association of Retail Grocers in Milwaukee, July 6th to 9th, and that representative members of the food and grocery industries of various European countries will also be present. Their presence is another indication of the interdependence of the various countries in the world's business. Exchange of experience and discussion of your common problems should contribute to broad and sound policies which will be reflected in the service of these industries to the consuming public.
I shall appreciate it if you will extend my cordial congratulations and good wishes to the delegates from our own country, and abroad.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. C. H. Janssen, 2388 University Avenue, St. Paul, Minnesota]
Note: The message was read at the 34th annual convention of the association, which met in Milwaukee, Wis. Among the 14,000 delegates to the convention were 13 grocers from European countries.
