Message to the Convention of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.
[Released September 20, 1929. Dated September 17, 1929]
My dear Mrs. Boole:
Please present my greetings to the Convention of the National Christian Temperance Union. I am daily impressed with the great need for [p.298] extended work of education in the moral, physical and economic benefits of temperance. Since the adoption of the Prohibition Amendment, too many people have come to rely wholly upon the strong arm of law to enforce abstinence, forgetting that the cause of temperance has its strong foundations in the conviction of the individual of the personal value to himself of temperance in all things.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Ella A. Boole, President, National Woman's Christian Temperance Union, 377 Parkside Avenue, Brooklyn, New York ]
