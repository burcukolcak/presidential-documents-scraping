Message to the Cotton Textile Institute.
[Released October 19, 1932. Dated October 18, 1932]
THE SEVENTH ANNUAL meeting of The Cotton Textile Institute comes at an auspicious time. In recent months we have seen a gradual but nevertheless definite increase in operation in many lines of American industry. This from all reports has been particularly true in cotton textiles. With cotton mills normally employing more workers than any other manufacturing industry, any improvement in your situation is bound to have an important bearing in the general economic recovery. I am confident that much of this progress has been due to constructive cooperation in social and economic planning. Your members have my best wishes for continued success in its activities looking to increased cotton consumption and better stabilization of operations and employment.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. George Sloan, President, Cotton Textile Institute, 320 Broadway, New York City]
