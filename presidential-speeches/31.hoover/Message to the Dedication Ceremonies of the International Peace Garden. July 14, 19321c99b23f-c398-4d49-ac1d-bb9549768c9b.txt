Message to the Dedication Ceremonies of the International Peace Garden.
[Released July 14, 1932. Dated July 13, 1932]
I EXTEND to your Association and to the citizens of Canada and the United States gathered to dedicate the International Peace Garden my hearty congratulations on this beautiful embodiment of your ideals. It is both touching and rich in future promise that this garden has been made possible principally by popular contributions from the school children of both countries. Thus it will not only symbolize more than a century of peace between neighbors but will also grow in significance with their growth in understanding of their share in sustaining the historic friendship between our two great nations.

[The International Peace Garden Association, c/o Mr. W. V. Udall, Boissevain, Manitoba]
