Message to the Dedication Ceremony of the Wright Brothers National Memorial.
[Released November 19, 1932. Dated November 18, 1932]
Dear Mr. Secretary:
Please convey to the assemblage at Kill Devil Hills my disappointment that the press of public business in Washington has forced me to reconsider a previous determination to attend the dedication ceremony of the Memorial to Wilbur and Orville Wright. This monument was generously authorized by Congress to commemorate the first successful attempt in all history at power driven airplane flight. While Secretary of Commerce, more than five years ago, I was a member of the commission which initiated this project, and I have taken a great personal interest in the progress of the work.
Please convey to Mr. Orville Wright my congratulations and my appreciation of the epoch making achievement of himself and his lamented brother.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable Patrick J. Hurley, Secretary of War, Washington, D.C.]
