Message to the Diphtheria Prevention Commission.
[Released January 7, 1932. Dated December 10, 1931]
My dear Mr. Lamont:
On the occasion of your luncheon to publishers and other citizens interested in the prevention of diphtheria, I should like to extend my hearty congratulations to the Diphtheria Prevention Commission which is completing its three-year demonstration program. It has given convincing proof that the disease can be prevented by the organized application of scientific knowledge. To have secured the immunization of more than half a million children is life saving work of the first magnitude. To have reduced the number of cases by more than half and deaths by over two thirds, is an impressive example to the rest of the country. The part played by the press in this educational effort merits grateful recognition.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Thomas W. Lamont, Chairman, Diphtheria Prevention Commission, 505 Pearl Street, New York City ]
