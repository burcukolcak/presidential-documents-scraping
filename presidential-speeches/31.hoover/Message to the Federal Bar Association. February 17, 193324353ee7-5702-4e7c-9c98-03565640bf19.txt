Message to the Federal Bar Association.
[Released February 17, 1933. Dated February 9, 1933]
My dear Mr. Vallance:
I thank you heartily for the invitation of the Federal Bar Association to attend its annual reception and dinner on Friday evening, February 17th. I regret that I shall not be able to be present. I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the Association, and my deep sense of the value of the contribution made by lawyers in the Government service to the protection of the public's interests, with courtesy and fairness to the citizen. I wish the members of the Federal Bar Association to know of my warm appreciation of their services to the Government during my administration.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. William R. Vallance, President, The Federal Bar Association, Department of State, Washington, D.C.]
