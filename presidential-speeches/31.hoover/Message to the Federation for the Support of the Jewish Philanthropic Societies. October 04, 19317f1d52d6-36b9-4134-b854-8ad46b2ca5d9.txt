Message to the Federation for the Support of the Jewish Philanthropic Societies.
[Released October 4, 1931. Dated October 2, 1931]
My dear Mr. Block:
My attention has been called to the work which the Federation for the Support of Jewish Philanthropic Societies of New York City is about to start or the ninety-one institutions which it supports, and so I send to you and to all the men and women who are assisting you in this drive for funds, my very best wishes for a successful campaign.
In these days when every agency in the country is doing so nobly toward those who are in need, because of lack of employment or other reasons, we must not forget the private philanthropic societies which are the foundation of charity work, and without whom thousands of sufferers and orphans and aged persons would have little, if any attention.
And so I commend you all for this eminent work of charity and as it deserves success, I fed quite certain you will accomplish it.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Paul Block, 247 Park Avenue, New York City]
