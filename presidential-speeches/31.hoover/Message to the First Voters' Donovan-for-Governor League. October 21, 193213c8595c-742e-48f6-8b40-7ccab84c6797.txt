Will you please be good enough to extend my cordial greetings to those assembled for the meeting which your League is arranging for October 21st and my warm appreciation of their invaluable cooperation in carrying on the high ideals of the Republican Party. The battle will be won by such aggressive campaigns as you are waging.
