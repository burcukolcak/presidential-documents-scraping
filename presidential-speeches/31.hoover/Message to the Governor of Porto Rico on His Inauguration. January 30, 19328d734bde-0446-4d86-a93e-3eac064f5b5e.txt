Message to the Governor of Porto Rico on His Inauguration.
Honorable James R. Beverley, Governor of Porto Rico:
On your inauguration as Governor will you convey to the people of Porto Rico an expression of my cordial good wishes and keen interest in their welfare. Porto Rico is to be congratulated upon the fact that you enter upon your office with an understanding of the Island's problems gained through long service with the Insular Government.
The responsibilities of government are peculiarly heavy in times of world wide depression with extensive unemployment and depleted revenues. Only by the strictest economy in all the necessary activities and a retrenchment in all matters that are not absolutely essential can the financial burdens of the government be met. This demands personal sacrifices as well as cooperation on the part of all agencies of the government and the people in working out their own local problems. Sound economic measures must be the main consideration if constructive progress is to continue.

I wish you every success in your administration.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: Mr. Beverley served as Attorney General of Porto Rico from 1928 until his appointment as Governor.
