Message to the Gustavus Adolphus Tricentennial Festival.
[Released November 6, 1932. Dated August 9, 1932]
My dear Dr. Hoving:
I deeply appreciate the invitation to speak by radio during the Gustavus Adolphus Tricentennial Festival in New York. The date of this celebration, however, falls on the second day before the national election at a moment when it will be impossible for me to participate. I deeply regret that this will prevent me from paying the honor which I feel for the memory of the great Swedish hero, and of addressing in person our fellow-citizens of Swedish blood who have given so splendidly of their character and genius to the upbuilding of the American Nation.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
