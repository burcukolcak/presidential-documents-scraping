I SEND my cordial greetings to the colored citizens at their service at the Hall of Fame in honor of the 119th birthday anniversary of Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her name will be ever memorable as humanitarian, ardent advocate of every cause of liberation of the spirit of man, and friend of the colored race.
