[Released October 11, 1929. Dated October 1, 1929]
My dear Mr. Contessa:
All Americans share a common pride in the daring and perseverance of Columbus in his discovery of America. The story of his trials and triumph has colored the whole tradition of life on this continent, and will ever continue to be an inspiration to courageous youth bent upon the pursuit of difficult but great ideals.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Vito Contessa, President, Italian Benevolent Society, 218 East 116th Street, New York City]
