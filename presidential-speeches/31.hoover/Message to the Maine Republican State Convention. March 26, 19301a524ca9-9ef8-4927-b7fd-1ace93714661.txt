Message to the Maine Republican State Convention.
PLEASE EXTEND my cordial greetings to the delegates to the Maine Republican State Convention. The party has met the issues before the country with constructive measures. Its record of legislation and administration justifies the continuing confidence of the people. In this faith your deliberations will be fruitful.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
