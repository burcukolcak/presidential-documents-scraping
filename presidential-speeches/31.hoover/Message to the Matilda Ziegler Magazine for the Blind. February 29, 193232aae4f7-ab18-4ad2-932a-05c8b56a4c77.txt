Message to the Matilda Ziegler Magazine for the Blind.
[Released February 29, 1932. Dated February 27, 1932]
My dear Mrs. Ziegler:
I am deeply interested to be reminded that March 1st will mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the foundation of Matilda Ziegler Magazine for the Blind, and I wish to express my deep sense of the wonderful blessing this work has been to those whose darkness has been lightened through this printed eye opening upon the outer world and supplied to them through your generosity and warm human sympathy. For yourself I wish the fullest measure of every blessing.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. William Ziegler, 907 Fifth Avenue, New York City]
Note: The magazine had been financed by Mrs. Ziegler since its foundation. In 1927, she established the E. Matilda Ziegler Foundation for the Blind, Inc., with a gift of $600,000 to continue the publication of the magazine.
