Message to the National Aeronautic Association.
My dear Senator Bingham:
I am greatly interested to learn of the meeting of the National Aeronautic Association in Chicago in connection with the National Air Races, and I would be glad to accept your invitation to attend the banquet on the evening of August 22nd if that were possible. I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings and regrets to those present. These meetings and races are a definite contribution to the development of aviation, supplying stimulation, incentive demonstration and exchange of ideas that are invaluable. I hope the occasion will be a great success.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
