Message to the National Boys' Week Committee.
[Released April 26, 1930. Dated April 23, 1930]
My dear Mr. Head:
I wish you every success in your program for National Boys' Week. With their sisters, the boys hold in their hands the most precious hopes of the future of our country. Their health, their education and their high ideals will determine the quality of American civilization a generation hence. Theirs is a noble heritage and I have every faith that they will add to its priceless worth.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Walter W. Head, Chairman, National Boys' Week Committee, Room 820, 211 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois ]
