Message to the National Capital Presbyterian Commission.
[Released May 26, 1932. Dated April 13, 1932]
My dear Dr. McCartney:
I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to those gathered at the dinner of the National Capital Presbyterian Commission on April 13th, to honor the memory of George Washington and of the Presbyterians associated with him in the work of establishing this nation.
His example and the example of your spiritual forebears challenge you who are leaders of this generation to a commensurate share in solving the hardly less difficult problems of our own day, and an equal courage and boldness in declaring the sound principles of life and government which they helped bequeath to us.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Rev. Albert Joseph McCartney, D.D., Chairman of the National Capital Presbyterian Commission, 1764 M Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. ]
Note: The message was sent to a dinner meeting of the commission on April 13, 1932. The purpose of the meeting was to celebrate the contributions of Presbyterian leaders who participated in the Revolutionary War. However, the message was not made public until the opening session of the annual assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America which was held in Denver, Colo., on May 26.
