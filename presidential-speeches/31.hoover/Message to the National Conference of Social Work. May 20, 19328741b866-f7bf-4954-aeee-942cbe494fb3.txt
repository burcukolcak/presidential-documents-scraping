Message to the National Conference of Social Work.
[Released May 20, 1932. Dated May 14, 1932]
My dear Mr. Hastings:
I am deeply interested to learn that the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection will hold a meeting in connection with the National Conference of Social Work in Philadelphia on May 20th, to consider how the goal of health and protection for every child may be attained. The fact that more than half of the States have already held White House Conferences and that others are planning similar meetings is encouraging evidence that the national survey of childhood, and the recommendations growing out of it are strengthening and enriching the lives of the coming generation. The value of such a united effort in behalf of children is beyond calculation.
I shall appreciate it if you will extend to those gathered from the various states for the meeting in Philadelphia, my hearty greetings and good wishes for the fullest fruition of their plans.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. George A. Hastings, Extension Director, White House Conference on Child Health and Protection, Benjamin Franklin Hotel, Philadelphia, Pa.]
