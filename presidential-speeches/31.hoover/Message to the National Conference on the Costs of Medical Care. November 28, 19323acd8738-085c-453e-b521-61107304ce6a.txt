Message to the National Conference on the Costs of Medical Care.
[Released November 28, 1932. Dated November 26, 1932]
THE WORK of the Committee on the Costs of Medical Care during the past five years is of unusual significance. When an unofficial organization of distinguished physicians, public health officers, social scientists, and representatives of the general public engaged on a five-year program of research present their final report with its recommendations, it should command general interest.
I wish to extend to the members of the Committee my appreciation of their efforts to aid in solving one of the most vital problems facing our people today. I regret that I cannot be present at the meeting of the National Conference on the Costs of Medical Care in the New York Academy of Medicine on November 29th to hear the plans proposed by the Committee for the delivery of adequate scientific, medical care to all of our people, rich and poor, at costs which can be reasonably met by them in their various stations of life. I commend a careful study of this report to the professional and community leaders throughout the United States.

Note: The Committee, established in 1927 with the support of eight major foundations and the Social Science Research Council, was chaired by Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur.
