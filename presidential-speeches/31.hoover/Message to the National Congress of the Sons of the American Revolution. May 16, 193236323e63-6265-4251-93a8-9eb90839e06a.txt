Message to the National Congress of the Sons of the American Revolution.
[Released May 16, 1932. Dated May 9, 1932] My dear Mr. Van Orsdel:
I regret that the pressure of public duties will make it impossible for me to attend the opening session of the National Congress of the Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. I will be obliged, however, if you will express my cordial greetings to the Congress and my wishes for a fruitful meeting.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER

[Mr. Josiah A. Van Orsdel, President General, National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, 1227 Sixteenth St. N.W., Washington, D.C.]
