Herbert Hoover
February 25, 1932

Message to the National Education Association.
My dear Dr. Potter:
I congratulate the Department of Superintendence of the National Education Association most cordially upon the success of its conference just closing in Washington; and the Nation upon the inspiration in the high service of education that flows out to the country from its deliberations. These serve again to remind our people that, however, the national economy may vary or whatever fiscal adjustments may need be made, the very first obligation upon the National resources is the undiminished financial support of the public schools. We can not afford to lose any ground in education. That is neither economy nor good government.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Dr. Milton Chase Potter, President of the Department of Superintendence of the National Education Association, Washington, D.C. ]
Note: The message was read to the closing session of the organization's 62d annual convention.
