Message to the National Foreign Trade Convention.
PLEASE EXTEND my cordial greetings to the National Foreign Trade Convention. It is especially appropriate at this particular juncture that representatives of the various factors of foreign trade from all parts of the United States should meet to examine the world trade situation and to study its special current problems.
The work of the foreign trade conventions is a fine example of cooperative leadership in business. Such meetings as yours benefit the whole enterprise of international commerce. They improve understanding of other markets and peoples by American producers and traders, and aid in developing merchandising skill and in establishing American practice on the sound basis of service to and understanding of the peoples of other lands.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message, sent to James A. Farrell, chairman, National Foreign Trade Convention, Hotel Biltmore, Los Angeles, Calif., was read at the annual meeting in Los Angeles, Calif.
