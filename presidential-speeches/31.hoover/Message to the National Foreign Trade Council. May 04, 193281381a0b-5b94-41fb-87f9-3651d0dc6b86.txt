Message to the National Foreign Trade Council.
[Released May 4, 1932. Dated May 3, 1932]
PLEASE EXTEND my cordial greetings to the Nineteenth National Foreign Trade Convention and the Ninth Pacific Foreign Trade Convention in joint conference in Honolulu. The work of these foreign trade conventions is an example of sound cooperative leadership and is of outstanding value at this juncture. It is especially appropriate that our foreign traders meet with our friends and neighbors from Canada and across the Pacific Ocean to devise means of coordination in the great enterprise of international trade. At the cross-roads of the Pacific, with whose shores the destiny of mankind is becoming each year increasingly concerned, your service to American foreign trade will be notably advanced by this important meeting.
HERBERT HOOVER
[James A. Farrell, Chairman, National Foreign Trade Council, Royal Hawaiian Hotel, Honolulu, Hawaii]
Note: The message was read to the opening session of the joint conference, held in the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii. The conference was attended by business leaders from the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Hawaii, Japan, New Zealand, and the Philippines.
