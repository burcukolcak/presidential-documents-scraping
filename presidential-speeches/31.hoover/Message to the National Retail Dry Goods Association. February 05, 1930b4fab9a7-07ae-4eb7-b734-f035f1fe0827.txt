Message to the National Retail Dry Goods Association.
[Released February 5, 1930. Dated January 31, 1930]
My dear Mr. Koch:
I am indeed glad to learn that an extensive survey of conditions in representative retail stores throughout the country indicates the sustained buying power of the people. The cooperation of the members of the National Retail Dry Goods Association looking toward maintenance of economic stability is a powerful aid to a nationwide movement that gives every evidence of success.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
