Message to the New England Council.
[Released November 19, 1931. Dated November 11, 1931]
Dear Mr. Knight:
I have been advised that the New England Council is about to hold its annual conference. I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express to you and through you to the members of the Council my deep appreciation of the work of your organization has done and is doing.
The Council has taken upon itself the duties and the responsibilities that it alone can best discharge. It has labored earnestly and effectively for the good of the six states it serves. Furnishing a model of farsighted and intelligent cooperation, it has courageously shown the way to the entire country.
The people of New England have true cause for gratitude for the splendid efforts of the Council in behalf of the unemployed. There has been no finer cooperation with the agencies concerned with unemployment than that accorded by the Council.
The work done by the Council is most gratifying. I have every confidence the Council will continue its unstinted efforts.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Harry C. Knight, President, New England Council, Statler Building, Boston, Massachusetts]
