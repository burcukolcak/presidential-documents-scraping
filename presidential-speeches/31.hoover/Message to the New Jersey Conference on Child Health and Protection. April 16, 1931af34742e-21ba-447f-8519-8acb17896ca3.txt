My dear Governor Larson:
I am deeply gratified that the State of New Jersey is undertaking at this time to crystalize and make applicable to New Jersey the recommendations of the recent White House Conference on Child Health and Protection and am especially gratified that you are lending your personal encouragement and appreciation to this work. I will be obliged if you will make known to the meeting on Thursday my warm appreciation of this great cooperative effort in behalf of childhood.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
