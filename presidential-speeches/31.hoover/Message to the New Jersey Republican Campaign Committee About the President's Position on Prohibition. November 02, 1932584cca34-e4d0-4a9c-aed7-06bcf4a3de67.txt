Message to the New Jersey Republican Campaign Committee About the President's Position on Prohibition.
I AM IN RECEIPT of your telegram stating that representations are being made that since my Acceptance Speech I have changed my position upon Prohibition. I would be glad if you would reply to any such misrepresentations that my position is unaltered. In that address I set forth my conclusions clearly and unmistakably. That statement is a matter of public record. It is inconceivable that it should be misunderstood.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. Edward C. Stokes, Chairman, Republican Campaign Committee, Trenton, N.J.]
