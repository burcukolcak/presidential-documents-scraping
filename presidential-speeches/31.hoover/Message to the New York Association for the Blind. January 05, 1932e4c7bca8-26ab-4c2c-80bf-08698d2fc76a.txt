Message to the New York Association for the Blind.
[Released January 5, 1932. Dated November 23, 1931 ]
My dear Dr. Finley:
In congratulating the New York Association for the Blind on its 25th anniversary I also congratulate the thousands of men, women and children to whom its ministrations have brought kindly care, training, employment, confidence and courage. I trust that this pioneer Lighthouse may increasingly shed rays of helpfulness and happiness into the lives of its beneficiaries.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Dr. John H. Finley, President, the New York Association for the Blind, 111 East 59th Street, New York City]
