Message to the Newark Star-Eagle, Newark, New Jersey.
[Released March 30, 1932. Dated March 19, 1932] My dear Mr. Block:
I have been advised that the Newark Star-Eagle, of which you are publisher, is celebrating this month the anniversary of its establishment one hundred years ago as the Daily Advertiser. The celebration of an event of this kind in the life of any city is worthy of special notice. This is particularly true, I believe, in the case of Newark, where the Star-Eagle has so long so notably served the interests of a rapidly growing cosmopolitan American community.
I wish to offer my felicitations to you and to express the hope that the Star-Eagle will long continue to parallel the city's growth with its contributions to the public welfare.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Paul Block, President, The Newark Star-Eagle, Newark, New Jersey]
