I am deeply touched by your message from the Quadrennial General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and I thank you and them most warmly for this heartening thought. The organized spiritual forces of the people have a vital part in shaping the vision of the Nation at all times, and never more so than in periods of especial difficulty and strain. Please express my appreciation to the Conference.
