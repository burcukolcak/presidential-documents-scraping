Message to the Salvation Army in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
[Released April 7, 1931. Dated April 6, 1931]
My dear Brigadier Harvey:
The people of Philadelphia have done a splendid work in providing local relief of local distress in these difficult times. The Committee for Unemployment Relief under the Chairmanship of Mr. Horatio G. Lloyd has accomplished a great humanitarian task. The independent cooperation of the Salvation Army in this work has been invaluable. I am deeply interested in your efforts to finance the continuance of these labors through the private generosity of the people of Philadelphia, and I shall hope that you may meet with the most generous response.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Brigadier James A. Harvey, The Salvation Army, 701 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, Pa.]
