Message to the School of Journalism Banquet at the University of Missouri.
[Released May 9, 1930. Dated May 2, 1930]
My dear Dean Williams:
Please accept my cordial greetings to yourself and your guests at the banquet of the School of Journalism of the University of Missouri on May 9th. The steadily rising standards of journalism are an encouragement to those who believe that the press should be not only one of the most powerful agencies in the life of the people, but also one rendering the highest possible service through dissemination of constructive thought in science, social advance and civic idealism. The greatest challenge to the ingenuity of the journalist is to make these things as interesting to the public as are the more familiar subjects which apparently must be treated in terms of conflict. I am happy to believe that continual progress is being made in these directions by the press.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Waiter Williams, Dean, School of Journalism, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri ]
