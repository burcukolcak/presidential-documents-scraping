Message to the Secretary of Agriculture Requesting Restriction of Leases of the National Forests for Wood Production.
[Released May 15, 1931. Dated May 14, 1931]
My dear Mr. Secretary:
In view of the manifest over-production of wood products, it seems to me it would be of assistance both to the commercial situation and to the real conservation of our forests, if the Department of Agriculture would still further temporarily restrict the leasing of the national forests for wood production. I believe it would be desirable now to more positively define the limitation of all leases by the Bureau of Forests except for pulp purposes in Alaska, to occasions when a sum of not more than $500 is involved and to cases where some cutting privileges must be given to actually maintain sawmills that are in operation, and this only where the mills cannot obtain raw material elsewhere.
The only reason I am moved to make these exceptions is that we should not deprive farmers and small industries of wood supply and should not create local unemployment by inconsiderate action.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable, The Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.]
Note: The new policy of greater curtailment of leases and timber sales was implemented by Department of Agriculture administrative order on May 20, 1931.
