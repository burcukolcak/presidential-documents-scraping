Message to the United States Delegation to an International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea.
[Released March 27, 1929. Dated March 14, 1929
My dear Congressman White:
In connection with the International Conference for the revision of the Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, which is to convene in London on April 16, it is my desire that the American delegation urge the international acceptance of the highest practicable standards in the various fields which affect the safety of lives of American citizens and of American vessels at sea.
This is a matter of great importance to the shipping industry in this country, and is a matter of even greater importance to American citizens who are engaging in ocean voyages in increasing numbers.
The recommendations which have been made by the technical committees organized by the Department of Commerce constitute, I am advised, a substantial basis for proposals by the United States at the forthcoming conference, and can be urged with the full assurance that the administration will do all in its power to place such standards into full effect in the event that they are incorporated in an international agreement.
Note: The message was addressed to Representative Wallace H. White, Jr., Chairman of the delegation.
