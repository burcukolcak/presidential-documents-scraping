Message to the World Affairs Institute.
[Released November 17, 1931. Dated November 9, 1931 ]
My dear Mrs. Adams:
I deeply regret that pressure of the public business prevented my accepting your kind invitation to address the World Affairs Institute sponsored by the Westchester County Federation of Women's Clubs and allied groups. An encouraging sign of our times is the trend toward greater citizen interest in national and international problems. I am confident that your meetings will contribute to an informed and enlightened public opinion helpful not only to the Westchester community, but to the Nation. I shall appreciate it if you will extend my most cordial greetings to the participants in your Institute and my best wishes for an occasion fruitful in promoting international understanding and concord.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Lucy G. Adams, Chairman, Westchester County World Affairs Institute, 170 Elm St., New Rochelle, N.Y.]
