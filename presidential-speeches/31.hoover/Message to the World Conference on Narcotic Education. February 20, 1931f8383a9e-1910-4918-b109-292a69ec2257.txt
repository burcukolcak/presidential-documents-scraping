Message to the World Conference on Narcotic Education.
I DEEPLY sympathize with the steadfast campaign of American organizations working to bring about international agreements for limiting the manufacture of narcotic drugs and to energize the police power of the several states of this Union to destroy illicit traffic in narcotics.
