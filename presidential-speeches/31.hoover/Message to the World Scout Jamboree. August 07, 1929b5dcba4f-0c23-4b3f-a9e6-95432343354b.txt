Message to the World Scout Jamboree.
[Released August 7, 1929. Dated July 18, 1929]
My dear Mr. Schiff:
I understand that you, together with representatives of the Boy Scouts of America, are about to start for England to take part in the World Celebration of twenty-one years of scouting--the coming of age of this great movement.
I hope you will express on my behalf the appreciation the whole of America has for this magnificent contribution to the development of our youth. The assembling of fifty thousand young men and boys from seventy different races and nationalities, in good fellowship without competition, and the self discipline which makes this possible are in themselves without precedent, and constitute, I trust, an augury for development of common ideas and friendship amongst nations.
As Honorary President of the Boy Scouts of America, I think I may speak on behalf of the millions of boys in the United States who have received benefits from scouting, and I send my hearty congratulations to the assembly.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Mortimer Schiff, 52 William Street, New York City]
Note: Mortimer L. Schiff was a vice president of the Boy Scouts of America.
