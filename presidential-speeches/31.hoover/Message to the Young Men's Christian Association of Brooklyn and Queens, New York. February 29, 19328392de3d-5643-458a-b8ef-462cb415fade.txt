Message to the Young Men's Christian Association of Brooklyn and Queens, New York.
My dear Mr. Greeley:
I shall be obliged if you will extend my greetings to the Brooklyn and Queens Young Men's Christian Association at their meeting on February 29th to survey anew its great character-building task. Society has laid a heavy obligation upon every agency dedicated to helping young men and boys in their effort to become upright and strong and you have my most earnest wishes for success in your part in this great task.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. A. H. Greeley, General Secretary, Brooklyn and Queens Young Men's Christian Association, 55 Hanson Place, Brooklyn, N.Y.]
