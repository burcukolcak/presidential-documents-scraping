New Year's Message to King George V of Great Britain.
[Released January 4, 1930. Dated January 3, 1930]
I AM happy to receive Your Majesty's message of new year wishes. The resolve to advance world peace by mutual good will and by the limitation of naval armaments is the earnest purpose of the British and the American peoples and of their governments and it is my hope, as it will be the endeavor of the American Government, to see this great object attained during the year which has just commenced. I also desire to reciprocate all Your Majesty's good wishes for the new year.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Majesty George V, Buckingham Palace, London, England]
