Herbert Hoover

Remarks at Carnegie Hall in New York City.
I HAVE ALWAYS failed at finding words to express what is in my heart at receptions such as you have given me. I am grateful for your generosity and your encouragement in this battle. It is a precious thing. It is evidence not only of the effort that you are making but it is evidence of what you will attain on the 8th day of November.
This is not a time for a further discussion of public questions. You have heard enough of that from me for one night.
I want to emphasize to you that this is not a question of a choice between men. It is not a question of choice between political parties. It is a question of choice between philosophies and destinies of your Government. An election is not confined to the election of a president. It means that if the policies in which you have faith are to be executed you must be represented in that sane philosophy by the government of your State. It would be helpful, but I should not take your time on the subject of my friend Bill Donovan.
And I would remind you if we are to succeed in administration we must have staunch supporters in the House of Representatives. There has been no more staunch person than Mrs. Pratt, and there has been none more encouraging and more alive to the enemy.
But the major purpose of my coming here is not that you might perhaps see me but that I might get some of your spirit. I wish to thank you and to express to you the gratitude that is in my heart for the reception which you have given me tonight.
Note: The President spoke at 10:45 p.m. to an overflow crowd estimated at 2,500 people. Representative Ruth Pratt introduced the President. William J. Donovan was the Republican candidate for Governor o≈ì New York.
