Herbert Hoover
June 16, 1931

Remarks at Columbus, Ohio.
THIS STOP has been one of unusual welcome and enthusiasm. There is not time for me to shake hands with each of you, for it is about time for your dinner.
Mrs. Hoover and I want to express our appreciation for this welcome-for this is an unusual welcome--so I will shake hands collectively with all of you.
Note: On arriving in Columbus, the President was greeted by some 20,000 persons. For 40 minutes he reviewed a Grand Army of the Republic parade with Governor George White. Afterward President and Mrs. Hoover received several hundred persons in the rotunda of the State House. The President, unable to greet all those waiting in line, spoke to them from the steps of the State House.
