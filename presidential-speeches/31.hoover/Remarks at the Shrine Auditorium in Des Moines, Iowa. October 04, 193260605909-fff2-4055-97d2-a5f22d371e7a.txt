Remarks at the Shrine Auditorium in Des Moines, Iowa.
THE PRESIDENT. I am glad to have the opportunity to express here to you my appreciation of your welcome. In the reception I have had from the people of my own State, I have seen evidence of that friendliness which warms one's heart. Firs in the escort provided by the veterans from every town and village in the State, the splendid reception at the Coliseum, and now your own gathering, and if I might judge from the response to my remarks, they are all good, hard-working Republicans.
BY STANDER. And Democrats too, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, you are welcome in our fold. Again, I thank you for your patience in listening, and I am depending on your help.
Note: The president spoke to an audience of approximately 3,000 people. The president went to the auditorium following his address at the Coliseum.
