Herbert Hoover
October 04, 1932

Remarks at the State House Plaza in Des Moines, Iowa
I SUPPOSE you have been listening a long time to what I have to say, and there is not much I can add that would help at this hour of night. On the other hand, I am glad to have opportunity to tell you how much I appreciate the welcome you have extended to Mrs. Hoover and me on return to our native State. We have seen today nothing but the outpourings of affection and welcome. I cannot recall any time in my life when I was so stimulated and encouraged as by the support I have found here in my home State.
I thank you.
Note: The President spoke to an audience estimated at 2,500 people. The President visited the plaza following his remarks at the Shrine Auditorium.
