Remarks on the Dedication of the New WCAU Radio Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
I AM GLAD to participate in these dedication exercises. Radio broadcasting has spread its influence to every phase of mankind's endeavors and achievements. Its unique value is the possibility it provides of bringing people and nations into immediate and intimate association, permitting universal dissemination of ideas, facts, and opinions. I had the privilege of sharing in the development of radio while it was still practically in embryo, when I was Secretary of Commerce. The radio art was developed with phenomenal rapidity. Most of this development took place in the last 10 years. It illustrates the possibilities of modern life wherein science, invention, technology, and industry quickly cooperate to put at the service of mankind the full values of scientific discovery. Already radio has had a profound effect upon all our institutions-social, political, and industrial--and upon the very color of our thoughts. This important position in our daily life has been well earned, and those who have ministered so admirably to its development deserve our praise and thanks. I heartily congratulate the management of the new WCAU Building upon their enterprise in erecting this unique temple to this modern art, especially constructed for radio broadcasting purposes.
Note: The President spoke from the White House at 10:30 p.m., as part of a dedicatory program for the new facilities of Station WCAU. The program featured leading radio entertainers and was carried over the Columbia Broadcasting System network.
