Remarks on the Presentation of the Collier Trophy to Harold F. Pitcairn.
Mr. Pitcairn and gentlemen:
The invention of the autogiro by Mr. Juan de la Cierva is one of the outstanding improvements in heavier-than-air craft. Its ability to arise and descend with safety almost vertically makes it a practical and decided step forward. Six years ago you, Mr. Pitcairn, recognized its value and later brought it to the United States where you and your associates have continually developed the device. By widespread demonstrations you have inspired public confidence to the point where the National Aeronautic Association felt justified in awarding it the Collier Trophy "for the greatest achievement in aviation in America, the value of which has been demonstrated by actual use during the preceding year." On behalf of the National Aeronautic Association, it gives me great pleasure to present to you and your associates the Collier Trophy for your development and demonstration of the practicability of the autogiro in the United States. This trophy is emblematic of the highest award in American aeronautics.

I congratulate you.
Note: The President spoke at 12 noon at a presentation ceremony on the White House grounds.
Harold F. Pitcairn was president of the Autogiro Company of America. During the ceremonies, James G. Ray, a company pilot, demonstrated the autogiro in a vertical descent and take-off.
