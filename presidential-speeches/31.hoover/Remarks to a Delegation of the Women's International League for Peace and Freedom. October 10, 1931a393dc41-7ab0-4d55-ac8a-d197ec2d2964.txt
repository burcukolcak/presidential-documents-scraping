Herbert Hoover
October 10, 1931

Remarks to a Delegation of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.
"I APPRECIATE deeply your coming to me. You realize as well as I the favorable attitude of the President on the limitation of world armaments. I am grateful for your effort to mobilize public opinion. No head of a government can go beyond the support that can be gained from public opinion in a world where democracy rules. There is no statesman at the head of any government in the world today that has not expressed himself as desirous of attaining these ends.
"I am glad to receive your petitions and will act as their custodian until you wish to use them elsewhere."
Note: The President spoke at 12:45 p.m. to a delegation of the United States Section of the league in the East Room at the White House. Prior to speaking, the President received a universal disarmament petition bearing some 150,000 signatures.
