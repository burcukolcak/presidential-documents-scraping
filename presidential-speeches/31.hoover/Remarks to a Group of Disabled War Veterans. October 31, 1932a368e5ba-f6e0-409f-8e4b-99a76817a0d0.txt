Remarks to a Group of Disabled War Veterans.
I APPRECIATE your coming here and your greeting me in this way. I saw the last war. I know the sacrifice the men here made who went to the World War. The men who were disabled have owing to them a larger consideration than is payable by money. The day will never come when this country is too poor or too niggardly to take care of the men who were disabled in the war. I am sure no American has ever denied the duty of caring for men disabled in battle. That is the first charge--a charge not alone on our money but on our sympathy.
Note: The President spoke at approximately 7 p.m. to the group assembled in the roof garden of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.
