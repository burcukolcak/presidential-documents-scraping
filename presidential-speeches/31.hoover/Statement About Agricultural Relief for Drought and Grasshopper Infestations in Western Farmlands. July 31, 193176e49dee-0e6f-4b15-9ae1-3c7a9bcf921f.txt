Statement About Agricultural Relief for Drought and Grasshopper Infestations in Western Farmlands.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I have directed officials of the Department of Agriculture to undertake, in cooperation with local and State authorities, such organization as may be necessary to meet the situation created by local drought and grasshopper destruction in the Northwestern and Central States. The Department is engaged in a resurvey in the light of the changes in the last 2 weeks. The area affected embraces certain counties in Montana, North and South Dakota, and local sections of Iowa, Nebraska, and Minnesota.
"While suffering within the areas affected is acute, the extent of the drought and damage is comparatively minor to that which we confronted and surmounted last year. The Federal Government has already extended assistance in some portions of those localities and the Red Cross is actively engaged in relief work. Secretary Hyde is in touch with the situation. National and local resources are available and the problem will be taken care of."
