Statement About Agricultural Tariffs.
THE PRESIDENT today received a telegram confirming dispatches from Buenos Aires as printed in this country in which it was stated that the leading newspapers in the Argentine Capital were advocating the election of Roosevelt with the hope that tariffs would be lowered, thus enabling the Argentine to export its agricultural and animal products to the United States.
Such exportations would result in further demoralizing agricultural prices in the United States as the Argentine products would replace large volumes of American farm products.
Note: The statement was released to newsmen aboard the Presidential train while en route from Denver, Colo., to Salt Lake City, Utah.
