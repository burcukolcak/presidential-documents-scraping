Statement About Appointments to the United States Tariff Commission.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"The following members of the Tariff Commission have already been announced: former Ambassador Henry P. Fletcher--Chairman, Thomas Walker Page, of Virginia.
"The President has today appointed John Lee Coulter, Chief Economist of the Commission, as one of the Republican members, and has also reappointed Mr. Edgar Brossard, present Chairman, and Dr. AlfredP. Dennis, present Vice Chairman of the old Commission. "Chairman Brossard and Vice Chairman Dennis will continue. Their inclusion in the new Commission assures it the benefit of experience hitherto gained and especially will tend to expedite the cases now pending and partially completed. The remaining member will be appointed within the next 10 days or 2 weeks."
