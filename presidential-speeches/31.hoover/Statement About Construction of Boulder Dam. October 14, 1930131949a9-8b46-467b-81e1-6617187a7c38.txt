Statement About Construction of Boulder Dam.
THE BOULDER DAM construction will proceed as rapidly as possible. The determination of the points of law raised by the State of Arizona will be expedited so far as the Government is concerned, and in the meantime, I am in hopes that the States may be able to get together and compose their difficulties. They are not so far apart as to make such a settlement at all infeasible.
Note: On October 13, 1930, Arizona was granted permission by the Supreme Court to file a suit alleging the unconstitutionality of the Boulder Canyon Project Act and seeking injunctions to prevent its implementation. The act authorized the construction of a dam and the allocation of water under a Colorado River Basin Interstate Compact without the acquiescence of Arizona. See 1929 volume, Items 132, 133, and 134.
