Statement About Nominating Major General Herbert B. Crosby as a Commissioner of the District of Columbia.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"After Major General Crosby has retired and thus become a civilian, I shall nominate him as one of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia. He has been a resident of the District for the past 7 years and has been much interested in its progress. He accepts only at my urgent request.
"I have consulted a number of leading citizens who consider with me that the District will be glad to secure a man of such outstanding national distinction in its service. General Crosby will have under his direction the police, fire, and traffic services. He does not wish to become presiding Commissioner, and prefers to devote himself to these particular branches. His headship of these departments will be assurance of just support and leadership to the men in these services. It will be a guarantee to both the official and unofficial residents of the District and especially to the Nation at large that the Capital of the Nation will be free of organized crime."
Note: Major General Crosby's retirement as Chief of Cavalry, United States Army, was effective on March 30, 1930.
On March 21, the President nominated Major General Crosby and Luther H. Reichelderfer to be Commissioners of the District of Columbia. On the same day, the White House released biographical data on the two nominees.
