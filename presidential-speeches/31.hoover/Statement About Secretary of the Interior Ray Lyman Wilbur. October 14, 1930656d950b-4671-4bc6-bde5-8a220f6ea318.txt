Statement About Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur.
DR. WILBUR will remain in the Cabinet. The University will gladly extend his leave as long as it is necessary, and he is too valuable a man to lose out of the Federal service. Being one of the trustees of that institution myself, I can speak with more authority than the student daily.
Note: Secretary Wilbur was president of Stanford University before becoming a member of the President's Cabinet.
