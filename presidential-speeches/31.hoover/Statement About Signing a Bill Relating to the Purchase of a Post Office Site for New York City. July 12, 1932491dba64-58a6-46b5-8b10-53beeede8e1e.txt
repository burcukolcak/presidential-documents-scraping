Statement About Signing a Bill Relating to the Purchase of a Post Office Site for New York City.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I have today signed H.R. 12360 which permits the Treasury Department to appraise and negotiate for a post office site in the city of New York. The bill is purely permissive and does not commit the Government to purchase and no commitment will be made before the congressional authorities have an opportunity to examine into the matter during the next session.
"I make this statement because a number of protests have been received from other property owners in New York City under the impression that the law provides for the acquisition of the property concerned at a specific price which is not the case."
Note: As enacted, the bill (H.R. 12360), approved July 12, 1932, is Public, No. 278 (47 Stat. 656).
