Statement About a Special Session of Congress.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I do not propose to call an extra session of Congress. I know of nothing that would so disturb the healing processes now undoubtedly going on in the economic situation. We cannot legislate ourselves out of a world of economic depression; we can and will work ourselves out. A poll of the Members of Congress would show that a large majority agree with me in opposing an extra session."
