Statement for the Flag Day Ceremonies of the George Washington Bicentennial Celebration.
[Released June 14, 1932. Dated June 13, 1932]
ONE HUNDRED and fifty-five years ago the Continental Congress established the fundamental design of our flag and General Washington set it afloat as a symbol of national unity and determination. It is today a symbol enormously more significant for it stands for all that has been accomplished by our people in the century and a half of this Nation's existence. That accomplishment was based on and made possible by faith, fortitude, resolution, courage, and character. What we need to do on this Flag Day, June 14, 1932, is to renew that faith, resolving that we will hand on to the next generation, unimpaired by the passing emotions of temporary distress, these national traits and the American system which they have builded.
