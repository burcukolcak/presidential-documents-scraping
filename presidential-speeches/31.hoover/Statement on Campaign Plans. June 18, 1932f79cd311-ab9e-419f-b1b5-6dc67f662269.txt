Herbert Hoover
June 18, 1932

Statement on Campaign Plans.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I have informed Republican leaders that except for a few major addresses expounding policies of the administration I will not take part in the forthcoming campaign as my undivided attention must be given to the duties of my office. The campaign will be conducted and managed entirely by Chairman Sanders and the Republican organization. It has been settled that the offices of the Republican National Committee should be removed from Washington and established at Chicago and New York. Mr. Sanders will be visiting Washington in the course of a few days to complete these arrangements.
"In accordance with the tradition since their beginning that heads of states should open the Olympic Games, I had hoped to avail myself of that pleasure, and I had also hoped to spend a few weeks at my home at Stanford University, but at the moment this seems improbable as my paramount duty is here."
Note: Everett Sanders was chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The Games of the Tenth Olympiad were held in Los Angeles, Calif., from July 30 to August 14, 1932.
