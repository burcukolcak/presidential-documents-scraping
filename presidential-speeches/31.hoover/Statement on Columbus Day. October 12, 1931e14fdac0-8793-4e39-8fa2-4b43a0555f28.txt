Statement on Columbus Day.
THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS of Christopher Columbus can never lose their color and significance. Recurrence of the anniversary of his discovery of America recalls afresh the triumph of his great adventure and its import to the whole world. In him action matched imagination and courage conquered all obstacles. His pioneering spirit symbolizes the tradition of the nation built in the New World which he discovered. On the anniversary of his landing we not only pay tribute to his genius, but may draw inspiration from the vast influence of the New World upon civilization itself.
Note: The statement was read at the 35th charitable festival of the Italian Benevolent Society, held in the Central Opera House in New York City.
