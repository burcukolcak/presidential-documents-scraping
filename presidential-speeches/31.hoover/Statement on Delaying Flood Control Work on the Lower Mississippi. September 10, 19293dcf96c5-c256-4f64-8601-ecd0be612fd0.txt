Statement on Delaying Flood Control Work on the Lower Mississippi.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I have a question on the lower Mississippi flood control work. On behalf of Secretary Good and myself I have informed Senator Robinson of Arkansas that if the Senators and Representatives of the interested [p.282] States are willing to assume the responsibility by making the request, then we will delay the undertaking of the new work on that portion of the Mississippi flood control covering the so-called floodway from the Arkansas River to the gulf of the flood control. That segment of the flood control work represents about one-third of the total expenditure. There has been a great deal of division of opinion and many views have developed lately, both technical and other questions, and I want to give full consideration to those views before settlement is finally arrived at.
"That will not involve the other major features of the flood control work, that is the strengthening of the levees on the main river and the tributaries and the New Orleans spillway, or the realignment of the river levees on the Missouri side south of Cairo."
