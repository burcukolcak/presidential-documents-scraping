Statement on Holidays for Government Employees.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I have received requests from Federal employees in the District that they should be given two periods of holidays so as to cover the Saturday following Christmas Day, and from New Year's Day until January 4. While I see little objection to the day following Christmas in order that Federal employees may have the opportunity of joining their families out of town, I do not feel that we should extend the holiday at New Year's. We cannot suspend the functioning of the Federal Government at such a time."
Note: On the same day, the President signed Executive Order 5764, closing Government offices on December 26.
