Statement on National Hospital Day.
THE UNITED STATES is blessed above all of the nations in the number, variety and excellence of its hospitals. Nowhere is private generosity and public wisdom better expressed than in the support of these institutions for the alleviation of human suffering.
The hospitals are meeting an unusual demand upon their facilities this year, especially in the field of free service. It is, therefore, especially appropriate to call to the attention of all the people that May 12th is National Hospital Day, and to recommend that wherever possible our people on that day visit the hospitals and familiarize themselves with their splendid service to their community.
