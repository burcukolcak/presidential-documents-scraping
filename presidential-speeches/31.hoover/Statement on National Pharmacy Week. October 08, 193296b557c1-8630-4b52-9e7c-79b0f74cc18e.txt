Statement on National Pharmacy Week.
NATIONAL PHARMACY WEEK, which occurs this year October 10th to October 15th, serves to remind the people of the invaluable service performed by the druggists. Their scientific skill in compounding the remedies prescribed by physicians makes them indispensable to the healing art. The rigid standards of excellence of products and of high professional integrity deserve wide-spread appreciation.
