Statement on the "Get Out the Vote" Drive of the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"The United States Junior Chamber of Commerce has undertaken to further a plan very radically to increase the total vote at the national election of this year. The united strength of the chamber's 50,000 members, who are from 21 to 35 years old, is pledged to work for this project for the next 8 months. State organizations for this purpose have been established. The chamber has asked for an expression of my approval of the purpose of this project, not only as a timely tribute to the memory of George Washington, but even more as a practical and patriotic service to the country at present.
"I do warmly approve of this undertaking. Ours is a representative government, and it can function effectively only when the will of the people is clearly expressed at the polls. The right to vote is not merely the privilege of the citizen, but definitely imposes upon him the duty to express his share in the common judgment at the polls. Every encouragement should be given to the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce to bring its project to success."
