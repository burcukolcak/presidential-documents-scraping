Statement on the American Legion's Employment Drive.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I appreciate the efforts being made by the American Legion and associated organizations in organizing an intensive drive to begin February 15 to extend employment. Mr. Henry L. Stevens, national commander of the Legion, and his associates have placed the entire organization also at the disposal of the organization that held its first meeting at the White House today. I am confident that the Legion and the organizations cooperating with it will perform a real service in the work undertaken."
Note: On January 18, 1932, the American Legion began an employment campaign designed to generate 1 million jobs. Working with a number of cooperating business and labor groups, it urged employers to add 10 percent more workers to their payrolls.
