Statement on the Appointment of John McNab To Study and Formulate Plans for the Improvement of Prohibition Law Enforcement.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"Mr. John McNab, of San Francisco, has accepted the joint request of the Attorney General, Secretary Mellon, Mr. Wickersham, and myself, to study and formulate, in cooperation with those Departments and the Law Enforcement Commission, the changes in Federal administration and judicial machinery which will be recommended to Congress for the more effective enforcement of the laws under the 18th amendment. As stated before, the general lines of reorganization on the administrative side are to centralize the administrative agencies and thus responsibility for investigation and enforcement into the Department of Justice. The study also includes methods of expediting judicial action. These proposals have to do solely with administration and procedure in enforcement of the laws and not with change in the laws themselves.
"It is expected that we shall be able to make definite recommendations to Congress at the beginning of the December session. I am in hopes [p.310] that Congress may in the meantime appoint the joint committee which I recommended on June 6th. Such a committee cooperating with the administrative agencies would expedite legislation as it would possibly enable bills to be formulated with less delay for hearings."
