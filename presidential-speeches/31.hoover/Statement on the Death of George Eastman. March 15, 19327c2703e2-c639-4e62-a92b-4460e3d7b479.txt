Statement on the Death of George Eastman.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I have learned with profound regret of the death of George Eastman. He revolutionized the art of photography, bringing the Kodak within the means of millions of people. By his own efforts he became one of the great industrial leaders of the world. He was one of the most generous and most constructive philanthropists of history. He gave strength to every movement for the public welfare of his generation."
Note: Mr. Eastman, chairman of the board of Eastman Kodak Co., died at his home in Rochester, N.Y., on March 14, 1932.
