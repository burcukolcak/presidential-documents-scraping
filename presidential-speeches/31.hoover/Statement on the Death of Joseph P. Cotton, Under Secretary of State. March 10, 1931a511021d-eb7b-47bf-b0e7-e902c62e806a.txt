Statement on the Death of Joseph P. Cotton, Under Secretary of State.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"Mr. Cotton's passing is a great loss to the Government and to our country. He was my friend for over 20 years. He has given much of his life to public service and has never refused a demand of the public interest. His abilities, his character, his devotion to the highest of purposes made him a great citizen."
Note: Mr. Cotton, a prominent corporate lawyer, served as Under Secretary of State from 1929 until his death.
