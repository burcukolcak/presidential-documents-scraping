Statement on the Death of Nicholas Longworth, Speaker of the House of Representatives.
MR. LONGWORTH served his fellow countrymen in State and Nation for over 33 years--nearly the whole of his adult life. In his service he contributed greatly to the welfare of the American people. His happy character, his sterling honesty, his courage in public questions, endeared him and held the respect not alone of his myriad of friends but of the country at large. His passing is a loss to the Nation.
Note: Nicholas Longworth served in the House of Representatives from 1903-1913 and from 1915 until his death, and was Speaker of the House from 1925.
