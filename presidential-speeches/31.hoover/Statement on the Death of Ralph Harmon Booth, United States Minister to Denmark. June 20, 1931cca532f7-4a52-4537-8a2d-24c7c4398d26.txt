Statement on the Death of Ralph Harmon Booth, United States Minister to Denmark.
THE DEATH of Ralph Harmon Booth, U.S. Minister to Denmark, which occurred today, deprives the public service of an able and devoted man. Appointed to the post in January 1930, after a distinguished career in American journalism, he had already rendered valuable diplomatic service. His death is a loss to the country.
Note: Mr. Booth headed Booth Newspapers, Inc., a chain of Michigan dailies, before he was appointed United States Minister to Denmark. He died in Salzburg, Austria, where he was undergoing treatment for a heart ailment.
