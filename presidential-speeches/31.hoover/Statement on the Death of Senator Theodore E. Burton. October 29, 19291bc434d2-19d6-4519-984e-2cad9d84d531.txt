Statement on the Death of Senator Theodore E. Burton.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"The death of a great leader is a national loss. Senator Burton gave practically all his long adult manhood to public service, in turn to his city, his State and to the Nation. His was always constructive action and from his leadership has sprung much of our national advancement. He was a true servant of the people, profoundly versed in the history and [p.360] tradition of our institutions, jealous to preserve their integrity. When the origins of great and successful policies are examined in the retrospect of history, the Senator's name will rank among the first leaders of his time. He has ever been held in a respect which many years ago became veneration. His death is a grievous personal loss to me. He was a lovable character and an affectionate friend."
