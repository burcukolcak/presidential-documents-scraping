Herbert Hoover
March 04, 1933

Statement on the Disapproval of a Bill To Provide Appropriations for Executive Office and Independent Agencies.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"The appropriation bills passed by the Congress when taking into account mere postponements to later deficiency bills show that the total appropriations for the next fiscal year were approximately $161 million above the President's recommendations. Of this increase, $130,900,000 is in the independent offices bill. The President is not signing this bill in order that it may be reviewed in the next session."
Note: Congress adjourned on March 4, 1933, resulting in a pocket veto of H.R. 14458.
On the same day, the White House issued a text of an "Analysis of Changes in the 1934 Budget Estimates Made by Congress in the Appropriation Acts so far as They Were Passed by the Congress."
