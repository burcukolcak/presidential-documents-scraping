Herbert Hoover
February 27, 1931

Statement on the Emergency Adjusted Compensation Act, 1931.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"Although I have been greatly opposed to the passage of the bonus legislation in its provisions for loans from the Treasury to people not in need, now that it is a law we propose to facilitate the working of it in every way possible.
"Inasmuch as the physical task of making loans to 3,500,000 veterans, or even half that number, who might apply, will require many months, even with the most intensive organization, I have requested General Hines to give complete priority to applications from veterans who are in need, and have asked him to set up some machinery for the certification of these cases, especially giving regard to the certification of the veterans' service organizations and the various relief organizations dealing with unemployment. The recent survey of the larger cities shows, in the opinion of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, that about 6 percent of the total number of veterans in industrial centers, are now receiving support from the local unemployment and other relief committees. This bill will relieve some of the burden now being carried by these committees, but as the amount possible for many veterans to borrow under the bill is so small, it is urgently necessary that the local committees shall continue their service to many veterans.
"I wish to compliment the veterans' service organizations for their cooperation in undertaking a campaign amongst all veterans, urging them not to take advantage of the loan provisions except in cases of absolute necessity. I understand they are placing it on the ground of assistance to the Federal Government in minimizing the amount of money we shall be called upon to borrow and upon the fact that loans upon the bonus certificates exhaust the protection to veterans' families under the endowment insurance features of the certificates.
"Taking General Hines' survey of the number of veterans being assisted by local committees as a basis, it would appear that if all loans were confined to need, the drain on the Treasury may be limited to 10 percent of the potential liability created by the law."
Note: On the same day, the White House issued the text of a letter, dated February 26, 1931, from Frank T. Hines, Administrator of Veterans' Affairs. The letter with inclosed reports follows:
My dear Mr. President:
I am inclosing herewith as complete information as it has been possible to secure as to the number of veterans and veterans' families who are receiving relief through organized charity.
These returns represent the reports from eighteen cities whose veteran population is estimated as approximating 898,469. While, in my opinion, the figures on relief extended are indexes only including, as they doubtless do, some duplication, and on the other hand in some instances probably not including all cases to whom relief is being extended, it is interesting to note that from these figures the percent of veteran population represented who is actually in receipt of relief approximates 8, as some 72,310 cases are represented by the attached reports. If we apply this percent to the 3,400,000 holders of bonus certificates there would result a figure of approximately 272,000, which is at least indicative of the number of veterans at this time so in need as to seek relief from organized charity.
I might add it is my personal opinion, however, that these figures on the average are higher than probably the actual facts warrant when we take into account possible duplications and also minor forms of relief which may be comprehended. I would say that a better average figure might be 6%. Further, I have checked back on certain reports originally received, and modified figures have been used.
Very sincerely yours,
FRANK T. HINES
Administrator
[ Honorable Herbert Hoover, The President of the United States ]
