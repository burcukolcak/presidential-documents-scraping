Statement on the Enactment of the Farm Relief Bill and on Plans for the Federal Farm Board.
AFTER MANY YEARS of contention we have at last made a constructive start at agricultural relief with the most important measure ever passed by Congress in aid of a single industry.
As it would have introduced many cross currents to have initiated any movement toward the selection of the Farm Board until after the legislation was completed, no steps have been taken in this direction beyond the receipt of several hundred recommendations. It will require 2 or 3 weeks to make these selections. The choice of the Board is not easy for its members must in a measure be distributed regionally over the country; it must at the same time be chosen so as to represent so far as possible each major branch of agriculture. Moreover, the Board must be made up of men of actual farm experience, and inasmuch as its work lies largely in marketing in conjunction with farm cooperatives, its membership should be comprised of men who have been actually engaged in directing farmers marketing organizations. It is desirable that the Board should have in its constitution at least one man experienced in general business and one with special experience in finance.
I am asking for a preliminary appropriation of $150 million at once out of the $500 million that has been authorized, and as Congress will be in session except for short periods, the Board will be able to present its further requirements at almost any time.
Note: As enacted, the Agricultural Marketing Act (H.R. 1), which created the Federal Farm Board, was Public, No. 10 of the 71st Congress, approved June 15, 1929 (46 Stat. 11).
