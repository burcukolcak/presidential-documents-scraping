Statement on the First Anniversary of Signing of the Treaty for the Renunciation of War.
THE KELLOGG PACT has focused the moral enthusiasm of the world upon the cause of peace. But if it is not to become another pious gesture it must be followed by practical and sincere measures, and the first among them is a turn of the tide of increasing armament.
Note: The President's statement was published in the August 27, 1929, issue of The Christian Science Monitor.
The international treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy was signed in Paris on August 27, 1928, ratified, and proclaimed by the President on July 24, 1929 (see Item 161 ).
