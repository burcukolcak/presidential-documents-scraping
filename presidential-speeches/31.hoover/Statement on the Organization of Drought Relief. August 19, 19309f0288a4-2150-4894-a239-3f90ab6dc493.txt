Statement on the Organization of Drought Relief.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"In accordance with the conclusions of my conference with the Governors, I have appointed Secretary Hyde to undertake coordination between Federal and State activities as Chairman of the National Drought Committee. The members of this Committee are:
CHAIRMAN [ALEXANDER H.] LEGGE, of the Federal Farm Board.

CHAIRMAN [HORACE PAUL] BESTOR, of the Federal Farm Loan Board.

GOVERNOR [ROY A.] YOUNG, of the Federal Reserve Board.

CHAIRMAN [JOHN BARTON] PAYNE, of the Red Cross.

CHAIRMAN [RICHARD H.] AISHTON, of the American Railway Association.
UNDER SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY [OGDEN L.] MILLS.

MR. HENRY M. ROBINSON, Chairman of the First National Bank of Los Angeles.
These members from the different national organizations will appoint alternates or additional members from those agencies from time to time to undertake the special problems before the Committee. Mr. Robinson has consented to serve on the Committee for purposes of coordinating Federal with State and private credit activities. The headquarters of the National Drought Relief Committee are being set up in the Department of Agriculture.
"The Governors of the various States are moving rapidly in the creation of their organizations. The Governors of Illinois and Virginia have reported their committees, comprising men of high leadership in their States. Their State committees are:
ILLINOIS
MELVIN A. TRAYLOR (banker), Chicago.

E. N. HURLEY (manufacturer), Chicago.

EARL C. SMITH (president, Illinois Agricultural Association), Pittsfield.

VICTOR A. OLANDER (secretary-treasurer, Illinois Federation of Labor), Chicago.

L. A. DOWNS (president, Illinois Central Railroad), Chicago.

HARVEY J. SCONCE (farmer), Sidell.

JULIUS POSTEL (miller and farmer), Mascoutah.

JOHN M. KREBS (farmer, banker, and representative of Red Cross),Carmi.

STUART E. PIERSON (director, department of agriculture), Springfield.
VIRGINIA
EX-GOVERNOR HARRY FLOOD BYRD, chairman

FREDERICK W. SCOTT (banker).

A. C. NEEDLES.
R. H. ANGELL (representative, Red Cross).

JOHN R. HUTCHESON.
These committees are already actively creating their county organizations.
"Continuing reports confirm the severity of the situation and the inevitability of distress over the winter in the acutely affected counties, which now apparently number something over 300. The rains of the last few days have stemmed the spread of the drought and greatly improved the situation outside of the acutely affected area. In those areas the destruction of crops has proceeded to a point that is beyond any great degree of recovery, although pasturage should improve. It must be borne in mind that from a relief point of view the burden of the problem in the acute area will show very much more vividly over the winter than at the present moment.
"I have received from all sections of the drought area high appreciation of the railways for their prompt and constructive action. It is a notable act of courageous cooperation and has been undertaken in the face of seriously reduced income due to the depression. It emphasizes the public interest of maintaining the strength and financial stability of our railways that they shall be able to cooperate in times of national difficulty.
"In order that there may be no failure to cover any case of distress pending the time when the States have completed their detailed organization, the Red Cross has given instructions to all their county agencies to take care of the situation."
Note: On August 20, 1930, the White House released texts of letters from the Governors of Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, and Missouri listing the membership of their State drought committees.
