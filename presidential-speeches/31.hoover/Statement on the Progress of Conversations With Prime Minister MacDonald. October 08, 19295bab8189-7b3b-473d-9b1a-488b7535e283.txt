Statement on the Progress of Conversations With Prime Minister MacDonald.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"There is nothing that I can report at the present moment on the conversations with the Prime Minister. These conversations are continuing in the most friendly of atmospheres. We fortunately have no controversies between our countries to be settled. We are, therefore, able to discuss our mutual problems in the long distance view and solely in the broad aspect of human welfare in the largest sense. Moreover, we are able to carry our conversations without circumlocution and in absolute frankness with recognition of the point of view of both sides. [p.319] Neither of us has anything to reserve. We have to search only for those things that will promote the increase of good will and moral solidarity between the two countries. The Prime Minister possesses a wealth of Scotch humor which lubricates any discussion.
"More important than all is the great evidence shown by the press and the American people of genuine friendliness to the Prime Minister of Great Britain and to his people. The demonstration that is in progress is in itself of more importance than any incidental conclusions that he and I might come to on matters concerning our two nations."
