Statement on the Reorganization of the Government of the Virgin Islands.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"We have undertaken to reorganize the Government of the Virgin Islands. The Navy Department has asked to be relieved of the administration, and I am assigning it to the Department of the Interior.
"I am proposing to forward to Congress the name of Dr. Paul M. Pearson, of Pennsylvania, for Governor. Other civilian officials will be appointed in replacement of naval officers.
"Congress recently made special appropriations for reorganization and developmental work in the islands, and the new organization is intended to make these provisions more effective.
"Mr. Herbert Brown of the Bureau of Efficiency and Colonel [J. Clawson] Roop, Director of the Budget, have drafted plans for the new administration which are being carried into action."
