Statement on the Special Session of the Congress on Farm and Tariff Legislation.
IN ANSWER to inquiries from the press, the President said:
"The majority leaders, both Senator Watson and Congressman Tilson, are united in their recommendations to me that there should be no recess in the special session until farm legislation is complete, and that there should be no recess after that except for a few weeks to accommodate the Senate Finance Committee in its hearings on the tariff bill unless there is a completely fixed agreement in the Senate as to an early date upon which a vote will be taken on the bill, with a further agreed period for debate on the conference reports, which would assure a final vote in the Senate as early as possible. The interest of the country obviously necessitates the rapid determination of both these questions, and I am entirely in accord with their views."
