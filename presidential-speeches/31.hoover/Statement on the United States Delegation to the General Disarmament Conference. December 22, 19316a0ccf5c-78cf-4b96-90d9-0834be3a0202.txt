Herbert Hoover
December 22, 1931

Statement on the United States Delegation to the General Disarmament Conference.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"General Dawes will head the American Delegation to the Geneva Conference. Mr. [Henry P.] Fletcher, I am sorry to say, finds that he will not be able to accept membership on the Commission. The whole question of disarmament is and has been of profound interest to the women of the United States. They have shown great interest in it for many years. I have determined to appoint a prominent woman as a member of the delegation. I am now conferring with a lady of high fitness for the position as to her acceptance of that important mission.
Note: Charles G. Dawes was U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain.
The General Disarmament Conference was scheduled to meet in Geneva, Switzerland in February 1932.
