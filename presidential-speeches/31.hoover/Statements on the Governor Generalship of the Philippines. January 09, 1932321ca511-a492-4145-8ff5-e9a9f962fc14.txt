Statements on the Governor Generalship of the Philippines.
IN CONNECTION WITH the announcement of Governor General Davis' resignation the President stated:
"Governor General Davis accepted the appointment to the Philippine Islands at great personal sacrifice. His resignation is based upon personal and family reasons, the force of which must, I feel, receive every consideration, particularly in view of the very generous sacrifices which he has already made in consenting to remain in the Philippine Islands much longer than his personal interests warranted. I have accepted his resignation with the greatest reluctance. His administration of the affairs of the Philippine Islands has been eminently able and successful and constitutes a fitting continuation of the distinguished service he previously rendered as Secretary of War. The 20 years during which he served in the Philippine Islands have been marked by exceptionally cordial and satisfactory relations between the American chief executive and the legislative and other local authorities. Governor General Davis relinquishes office with the deep regret of all concerned, and with a further claim upon the gratitude and affection of both the American and Filipino people."
With reference to the appointment of Governor Theodore Roosevelt to be Governor General of the Philippines the President stated that:
"Governor Roosevelt, who will be appointed to succeed Governor General Davis in the Philippines, has just completed a period of duty as Governor of Porto Rico, where he has administered the affairs of the island with marked ability and success. His experience in Porto Rico fits him specially to render valuable service in the larger field to which his new appointment will take him."
Note: Dwight F. Davis, former Secretary of War (1925-1929), served as Governor General of the Philippines from 1929 to 1932.
Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., served as Governor of Porto Rico from 1929 to 1932
