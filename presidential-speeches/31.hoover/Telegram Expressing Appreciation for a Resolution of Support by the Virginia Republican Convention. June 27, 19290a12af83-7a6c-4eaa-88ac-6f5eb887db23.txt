Telegram Expressing Appreciation for a Resolution of Support by the Virginia Republican Convention.
I THANK YOU for your message and deeply appreciate the expressions of encouragement and support adopted by the Virginia [p.202] Republican Convention. They furnish added proof of the purpose of the people of your great state to rise and remain above the level of single party control in local government.
The example initiated by the people of Virginia themselves under their own chosen leadership will prove an inspiration to other states throughout the South to do likewise and thus establish and maintain that wholesome rivalry between parties out of which come clean and efficient administration of public affairs in which the people. of all parties alike are primarily interested.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable R. H. Angell, State Chairman, Republican National Committee, Richmond, Virginia]
