Telegram to the Convention of the American Institute of Steel Construction.
I CORDIALLY appreciate the telegram from your convention. Thank you indeed for the encouragement it brings.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The telegram is in response to a message from the American Institute of Steel Construction Convention, which follows:
The American Institute of Steel Construction in convention assembled at Pinehurst, North Carolina hereby extend to you our loyal support in furthering your program of construction and employment. We also endorse and commend your suggestion to appoint a commission to study the causes that impair profitable operation of industry. It is our hope that such a commission would recommend a modification of the Sherman Act which in its present form we believe to be obsolete and in detriment to successful business operation. The removal of such a hazard would contribute largely to more stable employment in the future. We believe the country is fortunate in having as its President at this time a man of your ability and experience to cope with the unusual and abnormal economic problems that are the result of worldwide conditions. The results of your endeavors will be increasingly effective and appreciated.
