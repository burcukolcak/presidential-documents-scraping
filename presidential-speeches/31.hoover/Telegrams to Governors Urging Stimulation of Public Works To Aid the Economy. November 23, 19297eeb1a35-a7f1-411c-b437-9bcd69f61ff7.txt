Telegrams to Governors Urging Stimulation of Public Works To Aid the Economy.
WITH VIEW to giving strength to the present economic situation and providing for the absorption of any unemployment which might result from present disturbed conditions, I have asked for collective action of industry in the expansion of construction activities and in stabilization of wages. As I have publicly stated, one of the largest factors that can be [p.397] brought to bear is that of the energetic yet prudent pursuit of public works by the Federal Government and state, municipal, and county authorities.
The Federal Government will exert itself to the utmost within its own province and I should like to feel that I have the cooperation of yourself and the municipal, county, and other local officials in the same direction. It would be helpful if road, street, public building and other construction of this type could be speeded up and adjusted in such fashion as to further employment.
I would also appreciate it if your officials would canvass the state, municipal, and county programs and give me such information as you can as to the volume of expenditure that can be prudently arranged for the next twelve months and for the next six months and inform me thereof.
I am asking Secretary Lamont of the Department of Commerce to take in hand the detailed measures of cooperation with you which may arise in this matter.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The White House also released telegrams to the President from the Governor of Arizona and the mayors of Philadelphia, Pa., and St. Paul, Minn., offering cooperation. Over the next several days, responses to the November 23 telegram from the various Governors were made public.
