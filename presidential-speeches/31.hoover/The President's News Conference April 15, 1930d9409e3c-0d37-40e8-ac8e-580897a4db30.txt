The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. This is a small assembly this morning, and I have small news--in fact, none at all. I will just welcome you back to the new White House.

Q. Congratulations on that, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. You will be more comfortable and so will I.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and third news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, April 15, 1930.
Due to a Christmas eve fire in the executive offices of the White House, prior news conferences had been held in the State, War, and Navy Building.
