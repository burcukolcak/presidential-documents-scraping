The President's News Conference
SPECIAL AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN
THE PRESIDENT. I have only one thing for today. We are sending Mr. William R. Castle's name up to the Senate as a Special Ambassador to Japan during the period of the arms conference. We want to have there someone who is familiar with the naval proposals, and because of Mr. Castle's special familiarity with it and his fitness for the position we have asked him temporarily to take that position as a Special Ambassador. As you know, he has been one of the principal executives in the State Department for some 10 or 15 years. And he will return to his position as Assistant Secretary of State when we have completed the arms negotiations.
Q. When is he going, Mr. President ?
THE PRESIDENT. As soon as he is confirmed.
Q. Will he stay here to meet the Japanese delegation ?
THE PRESIDENT. Oh, yes, without any doubt.
POSTMASTERS
Other than that I have no news on this occasion, unless you want to know a list of 815 postmasters we have sent up to be appointed.
Note: President Hoover's seventy-third news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, December 10, 1929.
