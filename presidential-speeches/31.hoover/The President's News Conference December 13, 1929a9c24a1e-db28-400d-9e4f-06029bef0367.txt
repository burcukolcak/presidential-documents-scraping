The President's News Conference
VISIT OF THE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF MEXICO
THE PRESIDENT. I have only one announcement, and that is that the President-elect [Pascual Ortiz Rubio] of Mexico will come to Washington on the 26th of December, and he will be received as a most distinguished guest.
Q. Will he be a White House guest, Mr. President ?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Q. Overnight, Mr. President ?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't think so. Just dinner or something.
THE BUSINESS SITUATION
One point on the business situation--the Department of Commerce and other agencies report that the Christmas buying is up to the average of last year, and a little above the average of last year taking the country [p.468] as a whole--some places quite well above and, of course, some places a little below, which is a pretty fair index of the situation.
And that is all I have got on my mind.
Note: President Hoover's seventy-fourth news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, December 13, 1929
