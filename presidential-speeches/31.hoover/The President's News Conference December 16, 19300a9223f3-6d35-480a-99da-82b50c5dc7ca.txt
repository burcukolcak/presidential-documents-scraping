The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. There seems to be a lot of news elsewhere--a great plenty--no famine of that character at all in the city, so I have got nothing that I can add on this occasion.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and sixty-first news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, December 16, 1930.
