The President's News Conference
APPOINTMENTS
THE PRESIDENT. The only questions I have relate to some appointments in the District, and each one starts "Is the White House considering a successor to former Chief Justice, et cetera." I am certainly considering successors. That is part of my job, but I haven't got conclusions.
We will have some appointments of interest during the afternoon, I hope. Otherwise than that I haven't got any news at all.
Q. Will they be local appointments or national ?
THE PRESIDENT. National.
So that I am afraid I can't help you out this morning. It is getting time for Christmas and you don't want to work anyway.
Note: President Hoover's seventy-fifth news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, December 17, 1929.
On the same day, the President nominated Joseph B. Eastman for reappointment and Robert Milton Jones for appointment to the Interstate Commerce Commission. A brief biography of Mr. Jones and lists of endorsers for both nominations were issued by the White House.
