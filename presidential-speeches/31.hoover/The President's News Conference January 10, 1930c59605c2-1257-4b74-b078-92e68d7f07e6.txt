The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. It seems a sad thing to bring you all here from really a good day, but I haven't a thing on my mind. Our publicity news does not seem to break in so well with these conferences, so you will have to wait for another time. I have nothing today.
Note: President Hoover's eighty-first news conference was held in the State, War, and Navy Building at 4 p.m. on Friday, January 10, 1930.
