The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. This is a famine day. I haven't had a single incident that would make news. All the news centers have moved over to London and I will have to leave it there for a while--plus up on the Hill, of course, always. So I can't tell you anything.
Note: President Hoover's eighty-fifth news conference was held in the State, War, and Navy Building at 4 p.m. on Friday, January 24, 1930.
