The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I have two items.
FRED MORRIS DEARING
We have transferred Mr. Dearing from Portugal to be Ambassador at Peru. That is in accord with the policy which I stated some months ago of filling the South American and Central American posts with career men. All of the Central and South American posts now, except Bolivia, are held by career men in the diplomatic service. Bolivia is still vacant, and we shall find some service man to fill that post in due time.
EMPLOYMENT
The other item is the report of the Department of Labor for the week ending January 13, the details of which you can get from the Department some time during the day, but incidentally, it shows an increase of 3.3 percent in employment over the previous week, and that increase is current in practically every industry except one or two minor ones where there has been no increase, but it is generally distributed over the whole of the industrial world--some of them more than others--but the details of it you can get from the Department. It is at least an encouraging sign. And that is all I have this morning.
Note: President Hoover's eighty-sixth news conference was held in the State, War, and Navy Building at 12 noon on Tuesday, January 28, 1930.
