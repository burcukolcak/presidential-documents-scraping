The President's News Conference
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS
THE PRESIDENT. I had one question about District appropriations. I understand negotiations have been resumed on that subject.
GENERAL EDGAR JADWIN
I have a question on the Power Commission. I have selected General Jadwin for the chairmanship of the Power Commission, and he has accepted. The other members have not yet been settled on, but will be sent to the Senate in the special session.

And that is all that I have at the present time.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and twenty-third news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, July 1, 1930.
Gen. Edgar Jadwin headed the Army Corps of Engineers from 1926 until his retirement in 1929. On July 14, 1930, he declined the appointment as Chairman of the Federal Power Commission.
