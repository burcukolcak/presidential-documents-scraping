The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I have nothing today of any kind. I have some questions here on the reparations settlement on which I am unable to comment, as there is everything in the press that we have.
I also have some questions as to holidays during the summer. I am condemned to work this summer and stay in Washington so that I expect nothing out of it but Saturday afternoons and Sunday. Other than that I have nothing to help you with today.
Note: President Hoover's twenty-eighth news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, June 7, 1929.
