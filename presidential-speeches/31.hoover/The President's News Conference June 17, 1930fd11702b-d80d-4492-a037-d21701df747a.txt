The President's News Conference
ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON SHIPPING BOARD SALES
THE PRESIDENT. I have a question here as to whether we have completed the members of the Advisory Committee on Shipping Board Sales. In addition to Mr. [Albert C.] Dalton, who is already known, we have Mr. Ira Campbell of New York, Mr. Clarence Woolley, who is the chairman of the American Radiator Company, and whose seat of business is Detroit--he lives in New York, however, and is a Director of the Federal Reserve Board--also Mr. E. N. Hurley. There will be two more, but they have not yet been determined on.

Q. Mr. President, do you mean Mr. Hurley, the former Chairman ?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I am waiting to hear from Mr. Charles Pease, who was formerly on the Board, but I do not think his health will permit his doing it.

Q. Will Mr. Hurley be Chairman ?
THE PRESIDENT. There has not been any determination of that.
GREAT LAKES RESCUE MISSION
Also I have some telegrams and inquiries both from the press and from individuals from Ohio with respect to some citizens who disappeared on the lakes yesterday, and whose boats have been found undamaged, and asking for Government aid in making proper search I have directed that that should be done.
Q. Mr. President, are the Treasury facilities being used--the Coast Guard ?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, the Coast Guard is. A number of Ohio papers inquired about that.
TARIFF BILL SIGNING
That is all I have except that the tariff bill will be signed at 12:45.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and nineteenth news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, June 17, 1930.The Tariff Act of 1930 (H.R. 2667) is Public, No. 361 (46 Stat. 590).
