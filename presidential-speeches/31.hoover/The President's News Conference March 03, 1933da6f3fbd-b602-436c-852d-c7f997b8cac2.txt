The President's News Conference
FAREWELL TO THE PASS
THE PRESIDENT. I only wanted to express my appreciation to you for your cooperation in the last 4 years--many of you.
I haven't any news today. You will find plenty of news in other quarters, but I have had a pleasant association with you through a troublesome time. I want you to know that I appreciate it. We have all had difficulties, but nevertheless I have only recollections of a pleasant association with you all. I am in hopes if any of you come out to the Pacific coast, you will come and see me, and we will be able to discuss matters at more length in terms of objectivity than when we are in the midst of the battle.
I wish to thank you for the cooperation that I have had and to tell you goodby.
REPORTER. Mr. President, if I may speak for my colleagues, I would like to say that you will carry with you the best personal wishes of all of us. We have had a very pleasant association with you over these 4 years. Your responsibilities have perhaps been much greater than ours, but we have a feeling nevertheless that we were sharing that responsibility with you. We want to assure you most heartily, sir, that we wish you well and a long life.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very much. Goodby.
