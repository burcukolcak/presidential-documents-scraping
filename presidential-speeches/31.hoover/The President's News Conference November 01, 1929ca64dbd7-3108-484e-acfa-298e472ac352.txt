The President's News Conference
COMMISSION TO ATTEND CEREMONIES IN ICELAND
THE PRESIDENT. I have very little of general public interest at this time. Some of the special public will be interested in the appointment of the commission to attend the celebration of the 1,000th anniversary of the Althing in Iceland, and I have requested Senator [Peter] Norbeck, Congressman [O.B.] Burtness, Mr. [Frederick H.] Fljozdal, Mr. [O.P.B.] Jacobson, and Mr. [Sveinbjorn] Johnson to become members of that commission, all of which you will find set out in a mimeographed sheet.
APPOINTMENT OF G. AARON YOUNGQUIST
I have to announce today the appointment of Mr. Youngquist to the Department of Justice, and I only wanted to say that we have had some delay in that appointment because of the unwillingness of Mr. Youngquist to come for some considerable time. It has taken a certain amount of persuasion to induce him to leave his present position to come into the Federal Government, which accounts for most of our delay in filling the position. I am glad he has been able finally to accept.
Other than that I have no startling news.
Note: President Hoover's sixty-second news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, November 1, 1929.
The White House released brief biographical information on the appointees to the commission representing the United States at the 1,000th anniversary of the Icelandic Althing (Parliament) with lists of endorsers. The commission was also to present to the people of Iceland a statue of Leif Ericsson.
A biographical sketch of G. Aaron Youngquist, who was nominated for the post of Assistant Attorney General in charge of prohibition and taxation, was also released.
