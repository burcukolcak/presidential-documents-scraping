Herbert Hoover
November 26, 1929

The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I am afraid this is a dry day. I have been pretty busy trying to get out a message yesterday and this morning, so that I haven't had much time to think about anything else.
There is no news about the business arrangements that you don't already know, so I am afraid I am very little help this morning.
THANKSGIVING DAY PLANS
Q. Have you any plans for Thanksgiving, Mr. President ?
THE PRESIDENT. Nothing more than to eat a wild turkey that somebody sent in and decide what is to be done with five other turkeys that have arrived. Other than that we haven't anything in view.
STATE OF THE UNION MESSAGE
Q. When do you expect to have the message, Mr. President ?
[p.400] THE PRESIDENT. I expect to give you some advance on it if I can make it. I think it will be delivered on Thursday, so Tuesday I hope to get it out. Friday at the latest (it will be delivered).
I can't help you any more than that.
Note: President Hoover's sixty-ninth news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, November 26, 1929.
The President's first State of the Union address was delivered to the Congress on Tuesday, December 3, 1929 (see Item 295).
