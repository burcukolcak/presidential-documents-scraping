The President's News Conference
APPOINTMENT OF GENERAL GRAHAM EVERSON
THE PRESIDENT. I have one appointment to announce, and that is General Graham Everson as head of the National Guard Bureau.
OIL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
And I have only one question, and I will reply to that in the utmost confidence. Someone wants to know if I shall have discussions with Mr. [J. Ramsay] MacDonald on the subject of oil conservation. I hadn't heard of the subject, and I don't believe that any such discussion is going to take place.
Otherwise you haven't furnished me any material for thought today, and I am glad to leave the responsibility to you.
Note: President Hoover's fifty-first news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, September 20, 1929.
