The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I am sorry to have you all gather here without any returns, but I have none to give. There is nothing going on about this office that is of importance today that I know of. I shall be in the papers for the next week, I expect, with remarks on various subjects to keep you going. But on this occasion I haven't a mortal thing.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and forty-third news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, September 30, 1930.
