Invitation to Ramsay MacDonald to Visit and Discuss the World Economic Situation.
Ever since my conversations with the British Ambassador at Warm Springs, I have been hopeful that you might find it possible to visit Washington. I should particularly welcome such a visit in the near future, as the preparations for the World Economic Conference, of which you are to be President, are entering a more intensive stage and because of the need for making further progress toward practical disarmament. In my judgment' the world situation calls for realistic action; the people themselves in every Nation ask it. I therefore hope that you will find yourself free to come to Washington during the present month. If you can come, I trust that you will stay with us at the White House and bring with you any of your family you may desire.
