Letter on the Defeat of the Reorganization Bill.
Dear Sam:
Thanks for the fine fight. Will you also thank the Speaker and the others.
The reorganization bill is intended to simplify and improve the public service. With this single objective in view, I have given it my earnest approval.
The question presented is solely one of policy. Therefore, the legislative developments of yesterday offer no occasion for personal recrimination, and there should be none.
Very sincerely yours,
Honorable Sam Rayburn,

House of Representatives,

Washington, D.C.
