Telegram Urging States to Adopt Minimum Wage Legislation.
May I call your attention to minimum wage law just passed by Legislature of New York and approved by Governor Lehman which declares it against public policy for any employer to pay women or minors a wage which is "both less than the fair and reasonable value of services rendered and less than sufficient to meet the ultimate cost of living necessary for health." This represents great forward step against lowering of wages, which constitutes a serious form of unfair competition against other employers, reduces the purchasing power of the workers and threatens the stability of industry. I hope that similar action can be taken by the other States for protection of the public interest.
