Letter of Tribute to Benjamin Franklin.
My dear Mr. Staples:
I exceedingly that I shall be unable to be with you on May nineteenth for the dedication of the Benjamin Franklin Memorial at which time an heroic statue of Franklin to be placed in Franklin Hall of the Memorial will be unveiled.
One of the greatest and most useful of public men in our colonial and early national periods, Franklin with every generation looms ever larger in world history. Time, as we know, is a great leveler and shows little respect to any save those whose lives are linked with great achievements. But Franklin touched the life of his time at so many angles and his character showed so many and such diversified facets that he would be sure of remembrance on account of any one of several achievements.
Now, nearly a hundred and fifty years after his death, his accomplishments assume their due proportions. As statesman, diplomatist, economist, philosopher and scientist he would have a claim upon the respect of posterity even though he had not given us the immortal "Autobiography," reflecting in every page the true wisdom and sound common sense of which Franklin was the embodiment. It is in keeping with his strongly practical nature that the Memorial you are dedicating will serve a useful purpose.
Very sincerely yours,
Philip C. Staples, Esq.,

The Franklin Institute,

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
