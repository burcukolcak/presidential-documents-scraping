Remarks to a Congressional Delegation.
I am very glad to see you all and it is mighty good of you to come down here. I can't be truthful and say I am glad to get back—I am awfully sorry to get back, but while I have been having a wonderful time, I gather also that both houses of Congress have been having a wonderful time in my absence. Furthermore, I expected on this trip to get some good publicity about the fish I was catching, but couldn't in view of the fact that here in Washington ' apparently you good people have been going from Wirt to Wirt. The newspapermen on the train have been trying to make me say that I hope that Congress would go home very soon. I wouldn't say it because I hope you will stay here just as long as you like' to. For you younger members of both Houses—speaking from an experience of many years in Washington—I want to point out to you the advantages of the Washington climate in July and August. It rarely gets over 110 degrees here; there is no humidity and I don't mind if I stay here all summer.
Well, anyway, I wish you had had the chance I had to get away for two weeks because I did have a wonderful holiday and I have come back with all sorts of new lessons which I learned from barracuda and sharks. I am a tough guy. So, if you will come down and see me as often as you possibly can, I will teach you some of the stunts I learned.
It's fine to see you; many thanks; and I will see you all soon.
