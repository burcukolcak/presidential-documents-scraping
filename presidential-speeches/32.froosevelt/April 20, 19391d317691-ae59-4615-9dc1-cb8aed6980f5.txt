Message to Congress on Reserve Officers on Duty with the Civilian Conservation Corps.
To the Congress:
After consideration of the administrative difficulties and fiscal effects flowing from the enactment of the last proviso of Section 5, Public No. 18, approved April 3, 1939, I am constrained to recommend to the Congress that early consideration be given to amending the law so as to remove all Reserve officers on duty with the Civilian Conservation Corps from the purview of the benefits provided in that section of the law for members of the civilian components of the Army brought into active military service for more than thirty days.
In making this recommendation, I am influenced by the belief that the Congress in enacting the law had in mind its application to individuals serving on extended active duty with the Army under conditions where they are exposed to military hazards of the same nature and to the same degree as individuals of the Regular Army. While it is held that duty with the Civilian Conservation Corps is military service, nevertheless, application of the law to the Reserve officers on such duty is considered neither desirable nor necessary; as a matter of fact, as we all know, duty with the Civilian Conservation Corps is in no way comparable with active military dutyâ€”in fact, it is almost wholly civilian duty. Legislative action in accordance with my recommendation is considered preferable to the alternative of replacement of Reserve officers by civilians, and I therefore recommend the matter to the favorable consideration of the Congress.
