Request for Resumption of Bituminous Coal Mining.
WHILE an agreement between a majority of operators and workers in the bituminous coal industry has been negotiated, there is still a disagreement, with the union and one group of operators on one side and another group of operators on the other. The result is that the mines, which should be operating, are not doing so and there is a diminishing supply of soft coal available to plants engaged in defense production.
It is imperative that there be no shortage now, or at any other time, of coal for defense production purposes. In order that the supply be immediately replenished, through the resumption of mining operations, and in the best interest of the United States and its citizens, I publicly recommend and urge that:
1. The miners and operators already in agreement resume coal production under the terms of that agreement.
2. The operators and miners who have not yet reached an agreement, enter into wage negotiations and at the same time reopen the mines, the agreement ultimately reached to be made retroactive to the date of resuming work.
This will bring about prompt return of a steady and needed supply of coal in the interest of national safety. I am certain that all groups concerned in the wage controversy will put the interest of their fellow countrymen above any other interest and immediately begin making arrangements looking toward the reopening of the mines. Bituminous coal production must be resumed, and promptly. The public interest demands it and the public interest is paramount.
