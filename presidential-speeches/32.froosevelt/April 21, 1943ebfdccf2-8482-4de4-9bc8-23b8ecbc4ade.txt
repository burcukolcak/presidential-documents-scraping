Remarks at Corpus Christi, Texas.
I am glad that all cadets of the naval training station are hearing what I have to say, because what I have to tell you concerns them, as well as those here in this mess hall.
I regard this as one of the great American historic meetings. I think you will remember this just as long as you live, for we have just received a President on American soil- the President of our sister Republic.
I want to tell you that yesterday was one of the high points of my life. We had a perfectly magnificent reception in Monterrey. And today we are especially very happy to greet the President of Mexico, because here among us are a large number of Mexican cadets, as well as many other cadets from sister American Republics.
The President of Mexico would like very much- when we go out of hereâ€”to shake hands with his own cadets.
I feel that from the point of view of continental defense and unity of purpose, that the kind of mutual training we are doing with cadets from sister Republics, both in the Army and the Navy, means a wide and long step forward in the relations of this hemisphere.
Let the good work go on!
