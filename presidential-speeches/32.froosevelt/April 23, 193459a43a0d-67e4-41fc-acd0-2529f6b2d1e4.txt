Whereasin the course of said investigation a hearing was held, of which reasonable public notice was given and at which parties interested were given reasonable opportunity to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard;
Whereasthe Commission has reported to the President the results of said investigation and its findings with respect to such differences in costs of production;
Whereasthe Commission has found it shown by said investigation that the principal competing country is Germany, and that the duties expressly fixed by statute do not equalize the difference in the costs of production of the domestic articles and the like or similar foreign articles when produced in said principal competing country, and has specified in its report the decreases in the rates of duty expressly fixed by statute found by the Commission to be shown by said investigation to be necessary to equalize such difference; and
Whereasin the judgment of the President such rates of duty are shown by such investigation of the Tariff Commission to be necessary to equalize such difference in costs of production;
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,President of the United States of America, do hereby approve and proclaim decreases in the rates of duty expressly fixed in paragraph 1539 (b) of title I of said act on laminated products (whether or not provided for elsewhere in the Tariff Act of 1930) of which any synthetic resin or resin-like substance is the chief binding agent, in sheets or plates, from 25 cents per pound and 30 per centum ad valorem to 15 cents per pound and 25 per centum ad valorem, the rates found to be shown by said investigation to be necessary to equalize such difference in costs of production.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Doneat the City of Washington this 23d day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and fifty-eighth.
