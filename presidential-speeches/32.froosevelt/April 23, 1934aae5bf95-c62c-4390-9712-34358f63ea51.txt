Letter to the National League of Women Voters.
I wish to extend my cordial greetings to the Eleventh National Convention of the National League of Women Voters. The splendid work of your organization in promoting the ideals of intelligent citizenship and study of national affairs has helped in no small degree not only to further the successful participation of women in public life, but also to extend knowledge of national, State, and local problems throughout the community.
This type of educational work is of vital importance in our national life, and is more needed today than ever before when the solution of new and baffling problems challenges the cooperation of all our people.
It gives me great satisfaction to send to your members assembled in Boston my appreciation for their contributions to enlightened citizenship and my sincere good wishes for the success not only of their present deliberations but of their continued efforts in behalf of the public welfare.
May I take this occasion to say how much I appreciate the fine work of your President, Miss Belle Sherwin, in the interests of humanity, and to compliment you in having had her understanding and intelligent leadership for so many years?
Very sincerely,
National League of Women Voters,

Boston, Mass.
