Joint Statement with Prime Minister MacDonald.
The Prime Minister, the President, the British Ambassador and the Secretary of State met this afternoon with the officials and experts participating in the discussions of the past few days. They reviewed the substance of their discussions with deep satisfaction.
Among the subjects considered in these discussions were the world price level, central bank policies, monetary standards, exchange restrictions, improvement of the status of silver and, in addition, a number of world problems relating to trade and particularly the limitation of trade restrictions.
Agreement with reference to any of these subjects has been reserved for the World Monetary and Economic Conference itself.
It was never the purpose of the present discussions to conclude definitive agreements. They were designed to explore and to map out the territory to be covered. This purpose has been admirably served by the conversations which have taken place.
