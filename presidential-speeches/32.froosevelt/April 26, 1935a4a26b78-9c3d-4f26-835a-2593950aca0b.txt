Franklin D. Roosevelt
April 26, 1935

Greeting to the National Congress of Parents and Teachers.
My dear Mrs. Langworthy:
It gives me much pleasure to send a message to the delegates of the Thirty-ninth Convention of the National Congress of Parents and Teachers.
At this time when the homes of America are greatly in need of stabilizing influences, the theme you have chosen, "The Home -The Index to National Life," is particularly appropriate. I hope that your deliberations will result in stimulating the members of your organization to successful efforts in securing for all children in America the rights and privileges to which they are entitled.
I congratulate you for your past achievements and wish for you a full measure of success in the future.
Very sincerely yours,
Mrs. B. F. Langworthy,

President, National Congress of Parents and Teachers,

Chicago, Illinois
