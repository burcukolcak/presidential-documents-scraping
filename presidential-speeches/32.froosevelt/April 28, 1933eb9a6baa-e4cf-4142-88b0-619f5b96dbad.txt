Joint Statement with M. Herriot of France.
The President has discussed with M. Herriot the problem of intergovernmental debts. The President has set forth the entire situation from the American point of view and M. Herriot has explained how the problem appears to the French Government and Parliament. This long exchange of views, which was of the most frank and friendly character, was for the purpose of reaching a clearer understanding of the realities of the situation and will undoubtedly help in determining the steps to be taken hereafter.
It is the hope of the President .and of M. Herriot that these conversations, which have proved to be of value, may be continued in Paris and in Washington after M. Herriot has had an opportunity to report to the French Government.
