Message to Congress on Child Labor on American Vessels.
To the Congress:
To fulfill the obligations of this Government under the Minimum Age (Sea) Convention (Revised), 1936, I transmit herewith for the favorable consideration of the Congress the enclosed report from the Secretary of State and the accompanying draft bill to implement the convention.
This bill was prepared by an interdepartmental committee after careful consideration of the questions involved. The purpose of the proposed bill is to establish minimum standards for the employment of minors on American vessels comparable to the standards heretofore adopted by the Congress for the purpose of eliminating interstate traffic in the products of child labor. These standards consist in a basic minimum age of 16 years for employment on small vessels and a minimum age of 18 years for employment on large vessels and in certain other maritime employments considered to be particularly hazardous or detrimental to the health and well-being of minors of such ages.
I heartily recommend enactment of this proposed legislation for it will extend still further our frontiers of social progress by erecting additional safeguards against the employment of the youth of our Nation at immature ages.
Inasmuch as the convention heretofore ratified by the Government of the United States will become effective for the United States on October 29, 1939, it is a matter of great importance that legislation be enacted at this session of the Congress.
