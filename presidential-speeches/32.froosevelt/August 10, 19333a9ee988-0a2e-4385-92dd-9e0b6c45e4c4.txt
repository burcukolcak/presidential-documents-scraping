Informal Address at Bowdoin Farm
Bowdoin farm is accomplishing something not only for the younger boys and girls, but is also doing something to advance a cause that has long been a pet hobby of mine that is, to educate young men to become useful citizens outside of the cities.
More and more people are discovering that if they go to live on a farm they will never starve to death, while they may if they remain in the city. Of course, in the city they have a chance of becoming millionaires. But there are lots of things better than growing exceedingly rich, and one of them is having the assurance of a competence, of a sufficient living, of a good life and good neighbors.
You boys have a mighty fine chance at that assured life.
