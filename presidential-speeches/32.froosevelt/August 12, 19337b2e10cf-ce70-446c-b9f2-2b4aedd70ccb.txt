Remarks at a Virginia C.C.C. Camp
I wish I could spend a couple of months here myself. The only difference between us is that I am told you men have put on an average of twelve pounds each. I am trying to lose twelve pounds.
It is very good to be able to visit these Virginia Civilian Conservation Corps camps. I hope that they are as inspiring all over 'the country as these I have seen today.
More important, I have seen the boys themselves, and all you have to do is to look at the boys themselves to see that the camps themselves are a success.
