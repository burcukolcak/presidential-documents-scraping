Letter of Appreciation to Congress.
My dear Mr. Speaker:
If the opportunity presents itself, will you be good enough to extend my greetings to the Members of the House of Representatives and to express to them my deep and sincere congratulations upon the work which they have accomplished? When a calm and fair review of the work of this Congress is made, it will be called a historic session. It has dealt, in a spirit of statesmanship, with matters of vital interest to the lives of our people. Much has been accomplished for the permanent well-being of the Nation as a whole.
I am grateful for, and happy in, the cooperation between us, and I extend to each and every one of you my good wishes for a well-earned rest.
Faithfully yours,
The Honorable,

The Speaker of the House of Representatives,

Washington, D. C.
