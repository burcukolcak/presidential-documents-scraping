Letter to Department Heads and Agencies Against Predicting an Early End of the War.
At a most critical time, when production of essential supplies vital to the war effort must be kept at a high level, speculative public statements by responsible military and civilian public officials at home and abroad indicating an early termination of the war tend to curtail production of essential war materials. It is highly necessary that this condition be remedied and to this end all Government officials are directed to refrain from such public statements.
