Greetings on the Forty-fifth Anniversary of the Lord's Day Alliance.
My dear Mr. Willey:

I extend congratulations and best wishes on the occasion of the Forty-fifth Anniversary of the Lord's Day Alliance of the United States.
The object of your organization is, in my opinion, a very worthy one, and the efforts of its members toward the successful attainment of such a goal, are deserving of the highest praise. It is my sincere hope that this work may be carried on with even greater success through future years.

Very sincerely yours,

Mr. John H. Willey,
