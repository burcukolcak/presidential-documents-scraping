Letter on the United Hospital Campaign.
My dear Mr. Pyle:
While the Federal Government has necessarily stepped in to aid the States and localities in providing relief for the needy unemployed in their homes, it is impossible to make Government funds available to the hospitals for the care of the sick who lack funds to pay. Yet such patients are among the most needy of all the victims of unemployment. I have repeatedly stated my feeling that the care of the sick is a local responsibility. All over the land communities are rising manfully to fulfill this obligation.
I am interested to know of the campaign of the United Hospital Fund of New York on behalf of its fifty-six member hospitals, which depend wholly upon voluntary contributions and do not receive any tax aid.
I have been familiar with the work of this organization for many years. I commend its cause heartily to citizens of New York.
Very sincerely yours,
Mr. David H. McAlpin Pyle,

President, United Hospital Fund,

New York, N. Y.
