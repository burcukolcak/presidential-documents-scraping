Greeting to Finland on Her Independence Day.
His Excellency

Kyosti Kallio,

President of the Republic of Finland,

Helsinki, Finland
This anniversary on which the Finnish people recall with pride the achievement of their independence gives me yet another welcome occasion to voice the wholehearted esteem felt for them and for their Government by the people and Government of the United States.
It is my earnest hope that these tragic days may not be long in giving way to a happier era to permit the Finnish people to continue, untroubled, the steady development of their free political and social institutions which have aroused the admiration of the American people.
