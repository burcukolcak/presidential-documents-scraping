Statement of Thanks to the Republican and Democratic National Chairmen for Pledging Cooperation in the War.
Let me thank you both, personally and on behalf of our country, for the patriotic action you have in contemplation. The national organizations of the two great parties are capable of inestimable service in our present emergency. The Nation-wide quality of their personnel, the circumstance that their agents are men and women of eminence and respect in their respective communities will, I am sure, demonstrate that in time of war there can be no partisan domestic politics. There can be only a determined intent of a united people to carry on the struggle for human liberty to a victorious conclusion.
So, I am sure we appreciateâ€”and the people will appreciate -that the political truce is for the period of the emergency and that the principles of our respective parties will continue to dominate our courses. When the war is over we will still be adhering to our historic method of settling our domestic problems which has made our country the great Nation it is, and has shown the world that democratic freedom is a perfectly workable system of government.
My own thought, with which I hope you will agree, is that the two national party organizations can function to the best advantage in the field of civilian defense, but you will, of course, work out your own procedure and processes in carrying out your patriotic purpose.
