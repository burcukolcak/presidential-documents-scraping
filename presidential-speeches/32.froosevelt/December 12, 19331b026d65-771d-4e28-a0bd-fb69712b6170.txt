A Message to the President of the Pan-American Conference.
I wish to express to Your Excellency my fervent and devout hope that the efforts which I understand are being made by the Conference, both individually and collectively, the efforts being made by the League of Nations, by His Excellency the President of Uruguay, and those cooperating with him, and by all other agencies to bring about a cessation of the tragic warfare between Bolivia and Paraguay may speedily result in overwhelming success.
