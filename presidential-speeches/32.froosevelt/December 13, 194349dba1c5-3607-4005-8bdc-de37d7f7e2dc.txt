Statement on the Death of Marvin Mcintyre.
ANOTHER faithful servant is lost to the public service in the death of Marvin Mcintyre. Despite the handicap of frail health in recent years which would have defeated a less valiant spirit he could not be persuaded by any consideration of self-interest to relax his devotion to the heavy and important duties and responsibilities which fell to him to discharge.
To me personally his death means the severing of a close friendship of a quarter of a century. We at the White House shall miss him. We shall remember him as a public servant whose whole career emphasized fidelity and integrity in the performance of the many tasks which made up his busy day. We shall remember also his never failing humor, his cheerful spirit, and his ever ready helpfulness throughout these years. . . .
