Statement to the Federation of Women's Clubs.
My dear Mrs. Poole:
The dawn of a New Year always is a challenge. It suggests new opportunities. It is characterized by inventories, accountings of past performances, making of new estimates and resolutions.
We enter upon the New Year with a realization that we have crossed the threshold of a New Era. We have the opportunity of improving conditions and making our country a better home, materially and spiritually, for more than 120,000,000 people. To do this will require the concerted aid and continued efforts of many forcesâ€”of Government, Federal, State and local; of social, spiritual, industrial and financial agencies.
I welcome this opportunity to express my thanks for the splendid cooperation which you and members of the General Federation of Women's Clubs have given to me and the Government. Your support of the measures initiated by the Government to end the terrible depression and to establish social justice and economic security for all of our people has been and is a real influence for the good we have been able to accomplish.
I ask that we, men and women of the present and the new generations, continue to work together. With such united effort, we can attain the strength and force necessary to cure existing ills and give us a new national health and prosperity.
Very sincerely yours,

Mrs. Grace Morrison Poole,

Washington, D.C.
