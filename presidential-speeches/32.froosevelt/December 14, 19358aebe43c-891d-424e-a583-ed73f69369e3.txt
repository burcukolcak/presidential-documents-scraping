Statement on the New Agricultural Building at Tuskegee Institute.
Agriculture is and probably will continue to be the chief source of income for the South. The success of Southern agriculture is dependent in great part upon the industry, intelligence and thrift of the Negro farmers. It seems especially wise, therefore, that the white people of the South should provide for the erection of an agricultural building on the campus of Tuskegee Institute as an endorsement of the splendid work being done there in the teaching of scientific agriculture.
The success of the programs now being launched by the Federal Government for the rehabilitation of agriculture depends upon the program of education which must go hand in hand with any new development.
As an adopted citizen of the South I have great faith in Tuskegee.
