Letter on Retirement Pensions for Railroad Employees.
My dear Mr. President:
This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 28th concerning the subject of retirement annuities for railroad employees, and suggesting the desirability of a conference between representatives of the railroads and their employees for the purpose of considering the retirement problem and attempting to find a satisfactory solution.
In accordance with your suggestion, arrangements are now actively under way for a meeting of representatives of management and employees for the purpose of considering this subject. We hope to hold this meeting about mid-January, and you may be assured that, when it is held, full and thorough consideration will be given the suggestions which you very kindly offer and outline in your letter.
In this connection, permit me to take occasion to express our appreciation for what you have to say as to the aptitude of railroad management and employees in considering and dealing with their problems of mutual interest in a cooperative way. At the same time, we wish also to thank you for your manifest interest and help at all times in doing everything that can consistently be done to assist in helping solve this and other problems of the industry.
Sincerely yours,
J. J. PELLEY
Honorable Franklin D. Roosevelt,

The White House,

Washington, D. C.
