Letter on Retirement Pensions for Railroad Employees.
Dear Mr. President:
I acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 28th suggesting that representatives of the railroads and their employees undertake a conference for the purpose of endeavoring to reach a satisfactory solution of the existing controversy on the Railroad Retirement and Tax Acts.
We are now endeavoring to arrange for such conference and it appears that we will meet very shortly after the middle of January, 1937. It will be our purpose to exert every effort in the direction of reaching a satisfactory understanding with the representatives of the carriers.
I thank you for your interest in this matter and want you to know that your assistance, counsel and advice are greatly appreciated.

With kindest personal regards, I am

Very sincerely yours,
G. M. HARRISON
The President of the United States
