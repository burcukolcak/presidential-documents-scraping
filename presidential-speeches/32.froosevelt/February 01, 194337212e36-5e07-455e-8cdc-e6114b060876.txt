Transmittal to Congress of a Treaty for the Relinquishment of Extraterritorial Rights in China.
To the Senate:
I transmit herewith a treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of China for the relinquishment of extraterritorial rights in China and the regulation of related matters signed at Washington by the Secretary of State and the Ambassador of China on January 11, 1943, and a supplementary exchange Of notes also concerning matters related to extraterritorial rights which was signed by them at the same time and which according to its terms is made an integral part of the treaty.
I enclose for the information of the Senate a copy of the report of the Secretary of State laying the treaty before me, in which its provisions are reviewed.
The two main objectives of the treaty as pointed out in the concluding paragraph of the Secretary's report are the abolition of the extraterritorial system in China and the regulation of certain related matters. The more important among the latter are restated from the treaty and the exchange of notes in the report of the Secretary of State.
The treaty and the exchange of notes have my approval.
Accomplishment of the abolition of the extraterritorial system in China is a step in line with the expressed desires of the Government and the people of the United States. The spirit reflected by the treaty will, I am sure, be gratifying to the Governments and the peoples of all the United Nations.
I ask the advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of the treaty, together with the exchange of notes which accompanies it.
