Greeting to the Convention of the National Association of Broadcasters.
My dear Chairman McNinch:
It is a pleasure through you to extend greetings and good wishes to the radio broadcasting industry on the occasion of the Sixteenth Annual Convention of the National Association of Broadcasters to be held in the Capital of the Nation.
During the past year we have witnessed basic developments and progress in radio which will have a profound effect upon the application of broadcasting in this country as well as on the North American Continent.
One of the greatest advantages of the system of licensing broadcasting is that it is sufficiently flexible to lend itself readily to adjustment to meet our changing social and economic needs. In a new field of public service such as that of broadcasting we may and should expect rapid progress in both the development of the art and in meeting the public requirements that this national resource shall increasingly contribute toward our social as well as our economic advancement. The broadcasting industry has, indeed, a very great opportunity to serve the public, but along with this opportunity goes an important responsibility to see that this means of communication is made to serve the high purposes of a democracy. I have the high hope that the industry under the guidance of and in cooperation with the Federal Communications Commission will prove itself to be worthy of the great public trust reposed in it.
I hope the forthcoming deliberations will be fruitful of wise judgments in dealing with the many and diverse problems that enter into the broadcasting industry.
Very sincerely yours,
Honorable Frank R. McNinch,

Federal Communications Commission,

Washington, D.C.
