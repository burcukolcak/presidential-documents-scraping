Telegram Supporting the Child Labor Amendment.
Honorable Fiorello LaGuardia

Mayor of New York

New York, N. Y.
I want all friends and supporters of the Child Labor Amendment to the Constitution to know that my attitude toward this measure to protect the rights of childhood has not changed. Only last month I wrote a letter to the Governors of nineteen states asking that ratification of the Amendment be made one of the major items in the legislative programs in their states this year. I sincerely hope that my own state will be among those to ratify.
