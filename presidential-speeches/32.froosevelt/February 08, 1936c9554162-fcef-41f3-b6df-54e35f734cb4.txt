Statement on the Death of Former Vice President Charles Curtis.
I am deeply distressed to learn of the sudden passing of my old friend, Charles Curtis. Whether they knew him as a Senator, as the Vice President of the United States, or as the man he was in his own right, his legion of friends will remember him, always affectionately, and will mourn his passing.
