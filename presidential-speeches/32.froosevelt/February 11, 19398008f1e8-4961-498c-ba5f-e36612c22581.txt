Letter on a Federal Planning Agency.
My dear Mr. Cochran:
I am sending you the enclosed "Progress Report" of the National Resources Committee because it is more than the usual annual statement of a Federal executive agency. This report reviews the problems and progress with which a planning agency has been concerned during the last five years. It demonstrates the usefulness of the kind of planning service which, as I have recommended to the Congress, should be provided as a permanent establishment within the Federal Government.
I hope that this report will be helpful to you and your colleagues on the Select Committee on Government Organization in the development and enactment of appropriate legislation to provide for continuation, correlation and decentralization of planning work.
Sincerely yours,
Hon. John J. Cochran,

Chairman, Select Committee on Government Organization,

House of Representatives,

Washington, D.C.
