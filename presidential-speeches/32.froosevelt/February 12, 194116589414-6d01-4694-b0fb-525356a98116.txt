The President of the Senate.
Sir:
I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress a supplemental estimate of appropriation of $10,000,000 for the Tennessee Valley Authority for the fiscal year 1942, together with drafts of proposed changes in the text pertaining to the appropriation "Tennessee Valley Authority fund" (amendment to H. R. 2788, the independent offices appropriation bill, 1942).
The details of this estimate and the proposed changes in the text, the necessity therefor, and the reason for their transmission at this time are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget transmitted herewith, with whose comments and observations thereon I concur.
Respectfully,
