Letter to Marvin Jones Urging Crop Control of Cotton.
My dear Mr. Chairman:
As you know, I have watched the cotton problem with the deepest attention during all these months. I believe that the gains which have been made and they are very substantialâ€”must be consolidated and, insofar as possible, made permanent. To do this, however, reasonable assurance of crop limitation must be obtained.
In this objective, the great majority of cotton farmers are in agreement. I am told that the recent poll by the Department of Agriculture shows that at least 95 percent of the replies are in favor of some form of control.
My study of the various methods suggested leads me to believe that the Bankhead bills in principle best cover the situation. I hope that in the continuing emergency your Committee can take action.
Very sincerely yours,
Hon. Marvin Jones,

Committee on Agriculture,

The Capitol,

Washington, D. C.
