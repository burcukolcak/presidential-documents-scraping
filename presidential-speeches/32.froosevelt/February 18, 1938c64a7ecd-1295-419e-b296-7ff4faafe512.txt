Letter on Credit for Borrowers to Stimulate Employment.
Dear Jesse:
While the modifications we have heretofore made in your lending authority since my letter to you of October 18th permit emergency loans of various character, it is my wish that you make credit available to all deserving borrowers to which you are authorized to lend, especially loans that will maintain or increase employment.
Very sincerely yours,
Mr. Jesse Jones,
Reconstruction Finance Corporation,
Washington, D. C.
