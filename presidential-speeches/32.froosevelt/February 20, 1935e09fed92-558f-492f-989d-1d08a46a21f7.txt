Recommendation to Congress on Appropriations for Farm Seed Loans.
Sir:
I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress a draft of a proposed provision making available to the Farm Credit Administration the amount of not to exceed $60,000,000 to carry into effect the provisions of the Act entitled "An Act to provide for loans to farmers for crop production and harvesting during the year 1935, and for other purposes," approved February 20, 1935.
This provision will enable the $60,000,000 to be made available to the Farm Credit Administration from the appropriation for relief purposes as carried in House Joint Resolution No. 117, 74th Congress, 1st Session, as passed by the House of Representatives on January 24, 1935.
The $60,000,000 required for making these loans to farmers is for relief purposes principally in the drought-stricken areas and should therefore be defrayed from the general appropriation for relief purposes contained in House Joint Resolution No. 117. As the contemplated expenditures from the pending relief appropriation are included in the 1936 Budget, the inclusion of the $60,000,000 within such contemplated expenditures will not have the effect of increasing the Budget estimate of expenditures.
Respectfully,
The Speaker of the House of Representatives,

Washington, D. C.
