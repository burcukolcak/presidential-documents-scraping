Letter Inviting Delegates to the United Nations Conference at San Francisco.
The following letter was sent to Secretary of State Stettinius, Honorable Cordell Hull, Senator Connally, Senator Vandenberg, Representative Bloom, Representative Eaton, Commander Harold Stassen, and Dean Virginia Gildersleeve:
"I take pleasure in inviting you to serve as a member of the Delegation of the United States to the United Nations Conference which is to meet at San Francisco on April 25, 1945, to prepare a charter for a general international organization along the lines proposed in the informal conversations at Dumbarton Oaks. You will understand, I am sure, that the sending of this invitation several days after the public announcement is due to the unavoidable delay in my return to Washington from the Crimea Conference.
"I feel certain that this important conference bringing together all the United Nations which have so loyally cooperated in the war against their common enemies will successfully complete the plans for an international organization through which the close and continuing collaboration of all peace-loving peoples may be directed toward the prevention of future international conflict and the removal of the political, economic, and social causes of war.
"I am confident that as a member of the Delegation you would effectively contribute to the realization of the hopes and aspirations of the American people for an international organization through which this Nation may play its full part in the maintenance of international peace and security."
