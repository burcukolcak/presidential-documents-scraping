Congratulations on the Inauguration of Governor Herbert H. Lehman, of New York.
On the occasion of the third inauguration of Herbert H. Lehman as Governor of the State of New York, I will be grateful if you will express to him and his associates in the Government of the State my warm congratulations and at the same time my personal regrets that I cannot be present in person.
Governor Lehman's leadership has won and maintained the confidence of the overwhelming majority of the citizens of our State. His leadership is an outstanding proof that the processes of democratic Government can serve current needs, maintain a sound credit and demonstrate unselfishness and honesty in the conduct of public affairs.
He and all of you who are associated with him have my very good wishes for the coming years.
