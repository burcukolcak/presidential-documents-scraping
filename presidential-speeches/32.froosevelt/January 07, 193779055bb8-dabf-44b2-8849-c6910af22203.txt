Letter to Governors Urging Ratification of the Child Labor Amendment to the Constitution.
Dear Governor:

I AM sure you will agree with me that one of the most encouraging developments of the past few years is the general agreement that has been reached that child labor should be permanently abolished. Outstanding gains were made under the N.R.A. codes which have been maintained in many establishments through the voluntary cooperation of employers.
However, it is clearly indicated that child labor, especially in low-paid unstandardized types of work, is increasing. I am convinced that nationwide minimum standards are necessary and that a way should be found promptly to crystallize in legal safeguards public opinion in behalf of the elimination of child labor.
Do you not agree with me that ratification of the child labor amendment by the remaining twelve States whose action is necessary to place it in the Constitution is the obvious way to early achievement of our objective? I hope that you will feel that this can be made one of the major items in the legislative program of your State this year.
Very sincerely yours,
(The foregoing letter was sent by the President to the following Governors and Governors-elect: Governors Clyde Tingley, New Mexico; Richard Kirman, Nevada; Olin D. Johnston, S.C.; Herbert H.
