Letter to Congress Transmitting a Report on Fiscal Relations between the United States and the District of Columbia.
To the Congress:

Pursuant to the provisions in the 1937 District of Columbia Appropriation Act approved June 23, 1936 (Public No. 762, 74th Cong.), I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress the following report on Fiscal Relations between the United States and the District of Columbia.
The major recommendations in this report are outlined in my 1938 Budget message as transmitted to you on this date. I have considered these findings and recommendations in collaboration with the Advisory Committee and the Director of the Study, and I earnestly commend these to your close consideration at this session of Congress. I urge early enactment of the necessary legislative measures to assure a continuing equitable determination of fiscal relations between the two governments.
Special attention is invited to Sections 10 and 13, which show that while the extent of local governmental service in the District of Columbia is substantially equal to that in seventeen comparable cities, both the property tax and the total tax load in the District of Columbia are lower than in any of these cities.
