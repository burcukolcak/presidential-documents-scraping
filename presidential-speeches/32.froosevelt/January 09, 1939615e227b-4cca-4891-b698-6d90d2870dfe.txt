Letter of Invitation to the Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
His Excellency,

Getulio Vargas,

President of the United States of Brazil,

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

There have arisen during recent months various-questions of great importance in which our two governments are equally interested. It would be particularly gratifying if these matters could be discussed in direct conversations between high officials of our respective governments in that frank and friendly manner and in that spirit of mutual helpfulness which fortunately are traditional in the relations between Brazil and the United States.
For this purpose I am extending through Your Excellency an invitation to your distinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Oswaldo Aranha, to visit Washington as the guest of this government. If it is agreeable to Your Excellency and convenient for him I would suggest that the visit take place as soon as possible after the first of February.
I hope very much that it may be possible for your Minister to accept this invitation and to visit Washington where he gained so many friends during his service as your Ambassador to this capital, and where it would give me and the members of my government the greatest pleasure to welcome him.
Please accept the assurances of my highest consideration, together with the expression of my warm personal regard.
