Letter of Greeting to the Conference on Better Care for Mothers and Babies.
Dear Madam Secretary:

Will you convey to the delegates to the Conference on Better Care for Mothers and Babies my appreciation of their interest in the problems that will come before the conference. I rejoice that the responsible officials of the Federal Government and the States will have the benefit of their counsel in developing practical ways of providing more adequate care for mothers and infants.
The Interdepartmental Committee to Coordinate Health and Welfare Activities is at the present time considering the many questions involved in conserving the health of the people and will soon present a report in which will be outlined its recommendations with respect to the next steps to be taken. Clearly, preserving the lives and health of mothers and their newborn babies is of first importance in safeguarding family life and the welfare of the whole people. I look forward with interest to the findings of the conference.
Very sincerely yours,
The Honorable,

The Secretary of

Labor, Washington, D. C.
