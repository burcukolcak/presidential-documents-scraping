Greeting to the Dinner of the Electoral College.
It gives me great pleasure to send hearty felicitations and warmest personal greetings to the Presidential electors of the United States who are dining at the Mayflower Hotel on the eve of Inauguration. Yours was a special participation and the overwhelming victory which your votes registered is a measure of the responsibility which goes with so overwhelming a popular mandate.
We shall assume that responsibility cheerfully and in full faith that democracy can be made to function in the world of today as effectively as it did in the simple world in which our Nation was born a century and a half ago.
I trust that the dinner will be the rousing success which loyalty and fidelity to the principles merit.
