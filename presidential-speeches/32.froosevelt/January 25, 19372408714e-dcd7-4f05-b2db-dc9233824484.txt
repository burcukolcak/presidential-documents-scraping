Letter Discontinuing Conferences to Establish a Southeastern Power.
My dear Mr. Delano:
ON SEPTEMBER 17, 1936, I asked you, together with other representatives of the Government and private interests, to participate in a conference to explore the possibilities of joint use of power transmission facilities in the Tennessee Valley area. The preliminary fact-finding arranged for at that conference has been completed and the report is in my hands.
Since the conference of September thirtieth, a sweeping preliminary injunction has been issued against the Tennessee Valley Authority upon the application of nineteen utility companies, including certain companies who were parties to the conference. The securing of an injunction of this broad character, under the circumstances, precludes a joint transmission facility arrangement, and makes it advisable to discontinue these conferences.
Very sincerely yours,
Honorable Frederic Delano,
National Resources Committee,
Interior Building,
Washington, D. C.
