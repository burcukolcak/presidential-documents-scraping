Statement on the Celebration in Denmark of the Anniversary of American Independence.
I have learned with much interest and pleasure of the celebration of the anniversary of the Independence of the United States which is to be held in Denmark at Rebild National Park, with participation by American citizens of Danish birth or descent, some of whom may possibly have been instrumental in founding this remarkable international monument.
It seems singularly fitting, and of good augury for the future of international relationships, that the commemoration of this milestone in the progress of the American people toward a fuller expression of their national and individual life should find a sympathetic response in the land of origin of many of my fellow citizens.
It is my belief that the Americans assembled at Rebild Park may, by serving as interpreters between their lands of origin and of adoption, do much to encourage the growth of helpful international understanding, and advance the cause of good-will throughout the world.
