Letter to Henry A. Wallace on Cotton Adjustment Campaign.
My dear Mr. Secretary:

I want you to make it very clear that I attach the greatest possible importance to the cotton adjustment campaign. It is our first major attack on the agricultural depression.
I know that for the past two weeks the representatives of the farm adjustment administration have been presenting to the 2,000,000 producers of cotton the hard facts of supply and demand, but the real question is, are the cotton growers ready to recognize these facts and seize their opportunity.
I myself am one of those who as a planter of cotton has suffered from the absurdly low prices of the past few years. What I am concerned about, and what every other cotton grower ought to think about, is the price of cotton next year if cotton acreage is not reduced.
There are two reasons why every cotton grower should go along with the Government's national responsibility. The first is the patriotic duty of making the plan a success for the benefit of the whole country; and the second is the personal advantage to every cotton grower in helping as an individual to reduce an oversupply of cotton and thereby obtaining a better price for what he grows.
The responsibility rests on the individual grower, and I believe that we can get substantial unity among our more than 2,000,000 cotton producers for this program of a planned and orderly harvest.
Very sincerely yours,
Hon. Henry A. Wallace
Secretary of Agriculture
Washington, D. C.
