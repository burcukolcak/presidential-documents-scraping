Statement on the Boundary Dispute between Ecuador and Peru.
On February 6, 1934, I consented to serve as arbitrator in the boundary dispute between the Republic of Ecuador and the Republic of Peru in accordance with the terms of the Ponce-Castro Oyanguren Protocol concluded between those two countries in 1924, which provided that if the two Governments were unable to fix a definitive line through direct negotiation, the zone upon which they could not agree should be submitted to the arbitral decision of the President of the United States. I have been particularly glad to receive, today, the visit of the Ambassador of Peru and of the Minister of Ecuador, who have officially advised me that the nature of the arbitration has now been agreed upon by the two Governments through a further protocol signed on July 6th, last, which also provides that the Delegations of the respective countries will commence their final negotiations in Washington on September 30th, next.
This decision of these two great Republics to hasten the peaceful adjudication of this long-continuing controversy will be regarded as a cause for encouragement and gratitude by all lovers of peace on the American Continent. It will do much to insure the success of the deliberations of the twenty-one American Republics at the approaching Inter-American Peace Conference.
