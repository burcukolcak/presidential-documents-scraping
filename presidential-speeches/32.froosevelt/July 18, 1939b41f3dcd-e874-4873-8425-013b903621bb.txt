Franklin D. Roosevelt
July 18, 1939

Statement on the White House Neutrality Conference.
Senator Barkley said:
"The consensus of opinion on the part of those members of the Senate present was that no action on neutrality legislation can be obtained in the Senate at the present session and that a majority of the Senate would concur in this view."

Senator McNary expressed the same belief.
They agreed that a majority of the Senate would consider neutrality legislation at the beginning of the next session.
The President and the Secretary of State maintained the definite position that failure by the Senate to take action now would weaken the leadership of the United States in exercising its potent influence in the cause of preserving peace among other nations in the event of a new crisis in Europe between now and next January.
