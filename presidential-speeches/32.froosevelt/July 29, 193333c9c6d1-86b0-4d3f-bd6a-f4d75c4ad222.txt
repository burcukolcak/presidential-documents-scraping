Letter of Congratulations to Mrs. Christopher J. Collins, Jr.
My Dear Mrs. Collins:
It is with sincere pleasure that I have heard about your new baby daughter and the tribute you have paid to our effort toward industrial recovery by christening her Nira in honor of the National Industrial Recovery Act.
Signifying, as it does, the faith, confidence and cooperation necessary in any great human endeavor, I compliment you on your choice and hope that your baby will be healthy and happy in the better days to come.

Very sincerely yours,

Mrs. Christopher J. Collins, Jr.,

Upper Darby, Pennsylvania.
