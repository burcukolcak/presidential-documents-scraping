Letter to Herbert Lehman on Flood Relief in New York State.
Reurtel yesterday. In order to get around the difficulty of using persons in the civilian conservation corps on private ground in flood area the Federal Emergency Relief Administration have worked out arrangements whereby transients and other persons on relief will be concentrated in that area. I am informed by Aubrey Williams, acting for Mr. Hopkins, that fifteen hundred persons are being moved to the area this morning and that one thousand more are on their way. This action is authorized by the following telegram to Frederick I. Daniels: "This is your authority for employment of transients now on relief in the distressed areas New York caused by recent flood. These persons are to be paid while engaged in this work at the regular going rate paid to the persons employed from relief work engaged in similar labor." I sincerely hope that this will fully meet the situation.
Franklin D. Roosevelt
Honorable Herbert Lehman,
