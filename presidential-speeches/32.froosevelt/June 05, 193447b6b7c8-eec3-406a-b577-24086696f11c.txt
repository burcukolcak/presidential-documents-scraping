Message of Greeting to the American Newspaper Guild.
So many of my friends are attending with you the second national convention of the American Newspaper Guild that it affords me real and personal pleasure to send a word of greeting and best wishes. Newspapermen have been and are rendering real and valued service to the Nation. It is gratifying that they accept the great responsibilities that go at all times with their work. I wish for you a most successful convention.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
