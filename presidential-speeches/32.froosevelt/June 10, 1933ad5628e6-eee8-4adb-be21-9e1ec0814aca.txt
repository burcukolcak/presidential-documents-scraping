Message to Congress Transmitting Executive Order 6166
To the Congress:
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 1, Title III, of the Act entitled "An Act to maintain the credit of the United States Government," approved March 20, 1933, I am transmitting herewith an Executive Order for certain regroupings, consolidations, transfers, and abolitions of executive agencies and functions thereof.
Please let me tell you very simply and frankly that in transmitting this Executive Order at this late hour in the Special Session, I have had no thought of taking what might be considered an advantage of the Congress. The very urgent demands of the public business, both legislative and administrative, during the past few weeks have made it literally impossible to complete the study of consolidation.
Many other changes are in contemplation and I have selected only those which I believe should be put into effect as quickly as possible. These additional changes I do not feel it right to submit until the next regular session of the Congress.
May I suggest that if the changes proposed in the present Executive Order are not concurred in by the Congress they can be restored or otherwise changed at the beginning of the next regular session a few months hence.
The justification for sending this Executive Order up, even at this late hour, is that it will effect a saving of more than $25,000,000. This is well worth while.
The Executive Order 6166 only affects such reorganizations as could be determined upon within the limited period of time available for study.
