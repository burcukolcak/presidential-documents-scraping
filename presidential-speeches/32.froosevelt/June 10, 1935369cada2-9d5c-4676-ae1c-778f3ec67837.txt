The Department of Justice is Asked to Investigate Kidnapping Suspects.
Newspapers report long criminal record in case of two men definitely suspected of Weyerhaeuser kidnapping, including not only arrests and convictions but also paroles. Every decent citizen is interested in humane parole systems, which seek rehabilitation of offenders, but at the same time we should seek to prevent abuses of parole, especially in cases of habitual criminals. Therefore I am glad that you are having a special study made of these two cases, investigating all facts relating to their previous records in every jurisdiction where they have been apprehended or paroled.
