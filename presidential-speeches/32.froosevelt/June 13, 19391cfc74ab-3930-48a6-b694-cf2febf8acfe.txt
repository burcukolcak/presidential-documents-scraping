Franklin D. Roosevelt
June 13, 1939

Greeting to the N.A.A.C.P.
Dear Mr. White:
The opportunities of a democratic people to participate in national progress are legion. Their responsibilities for sharing in the achievement of that progress are equally great. We delight in recognizing the contributions which members of the Negro race have made to American life and the part which they have had in the progress of the nation.
My sincerest wish for all of you is that your opportunities may be increasingly shared and your responsibilities continuously accepted in helping the Negro race to hold fast to the advancements already made and in moving forward to higher planes of accomplishment. As an integral group in our American democracy we look to you to uphold its ideals, to help to carry its burdens and to partake of its blessings.
In extending cordial greetings to the Thirtieth Annual Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, may I express the hope that the Negro race will find steadily expanding fields in which to serve with industry, loyalty and distinction.
Very sincerely yours,
Mr. Walter White,

National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,

New York, N. Y.
