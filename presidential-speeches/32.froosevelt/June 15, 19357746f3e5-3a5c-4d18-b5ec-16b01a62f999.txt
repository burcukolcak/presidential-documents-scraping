Franklin D. Roosevelt
June 15, 1935

Statement on Executive Orders 7073 and 7074.
The administration of the amended Act will proceed as rapidly as possible to adjust activities and personnel to conform to present limited objectives.
So long, however, as there is a possibility of further legislation it will be desirable to maintain the general structure of the recovery administration in Washington and in field offices, and to retain those essential members of a trained personnel who can be usefully employed. There will be lasting values in a careful appraisal of the two-year accomplishments of the N.R.A. and in preserving for permanent use the records of that experience. This can be done most efficiently and economically by those heretofore engaged in the work of codification.
A steady but gradual reduction of personnel is, therefore, a sound public policy which will also avoid imposing undue hardships on faithful public employees who can continue to render a service of exceptional value to the Government. It will be necessary, of course, to retain a sufficient field force to report on the effects of code abolition. This will include information covering changes in labor and fair practice standards.
