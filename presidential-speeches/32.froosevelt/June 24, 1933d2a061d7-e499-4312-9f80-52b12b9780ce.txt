Request to Cotton Growers for Cooperation.
The fate of any plan depends upon the support it is given by those who are asked to put it into operation. This program for the cotton producer essentially places the responsibility upon the individual farmer.
He and he alone will, in the last analysis, determine whether it shall succeed.
This plan offers the cotton producer a practical, definite means to put into immediate application the methods which Congress has prescribed to improve his situation.
I have every confidence that the cotton producer will face the facts and cooperate fully in the reasonable and practical plan that is proposed.
