Franklin D. Roosevelt
June 25, 1938

Greeting to the NAACP.
Dear Mr. White:
I am happy to extend to the Twenty-ninth Annual Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People cordial greetings and best wishes for the success of its efforts in advancing the interests of the Negro race and bringing about that cooperation and understanding between the races so essential to the maintenance of a vital democracy.
I have watched with interest the constructive efforts of your organization, not only in behalf of the Negro people in our nation, but also in behalf of the democratic ideals and principles so dear to our entire nation. For it is evident that no democracy can long survive which does not accept as fundamental to its very existence the recognition of the rights of its minorities.
I wish you a most successful meeting.
Very sincerely yours,
Mr. Walter White,

National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,

Columbus, Ohio.
