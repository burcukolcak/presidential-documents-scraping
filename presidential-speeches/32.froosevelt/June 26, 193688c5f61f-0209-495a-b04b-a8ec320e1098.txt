Letter of Congratulation to the National Youth Administration.
My dear Mr. Williams:
One year ago today when I signed the Executive Order creating the National Youth Administration and placing its affairs in your hands, I predicted that the return on the investment would be high.
I am happy to see that this prediction, twelve months later, has been fulfilled. I am still more gratified that Congress, sharing in this belief, has seen fit to include a substantial allotment for the National Youth Administration in the Deficiency Bill for 1937.
No greater obligation faces the Government than to justify the faith of its young people in the fundamental rightness of our democratic institutions and to preserve their strength, loyalty and idealism against the time when they must assume the responsibilities of citizenship. The splendid record of the National Youth Administration in helping some 600,000 young men and women against the despair of idleness seems to me excellent testimony that our means of meeting that obligation are sound.
It is my sincere hope that the influence and usefulness of the National Youth Administration will continue to widen during the coming year.
Very sincerely yours,
Honorable Aubrey Williams,

National Youth Administration,

Washington, D. C.
