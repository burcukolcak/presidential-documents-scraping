Letter to Emily R. Kneubuhl of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs.
My dear Miss Kneubuhl:
Because of the widening of women's horizons through recent decades, they have acquired such a knowledge and understanding of human needs that they are qualified to make a valuable contribution to our program of national planning for social justice.
Women already can point to some fine achievements along this line. They can rejoice in the success of the representatives of their sex in public positions and particularly in the constructive contributions that these women leaders are making to the whole program of progress. Women also can take justifiable pride in the widespread accomplishments of their own organizations, the indefatigable efforts of which have been largely responsible for much of the social legislation already achieved in State and Federal Government, in the way both of permanent statutes and of emergency measures.
I appeal to you, therefore, to continue to show even in the face of uncertainties the courage, the vision, the initiative and the cooperation that you have displayed in the first months of our new era.
Very sincerely yours,
Miss Emily R. Kneubuhl,
The National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs,

New York, N. Y.
