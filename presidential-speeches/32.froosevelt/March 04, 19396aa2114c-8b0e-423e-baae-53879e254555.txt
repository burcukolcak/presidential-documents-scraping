Request for Defense Appropriations.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives:
I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress 10 supplemental estimates of appropriation for the War Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1939, totaling $69,738,287, all of which would remain available until June 30, 1940, and $1,953,443 of which would remain available until expended. In addition, these estimates provide for the granting of contract authorizations aggregating $46,801,000. These estimates are for the purpose of carrying out certain recommendations contained in my message to Congress of January 12, 1939, upon the subject of national defense.
The details of these supplemental estimates of appropriation, the necessity therefor, and the reasons for their transmission at this time are set forth in the letter of the Acting Director of the Bureau of the Budget, transmitted herewith, with whose comments and observations I concur.
Respectfully,
