Request for Lend-Lease Program Appropriations.
My dear Mr. Speaker:
This Nation has felt that it was imperative to the security of America that we encourage the democracies' heroic resistance to aggressions, by not only maintaining but also increasing the flow of material assistance from this country. Therefore, the Congress has enacted and I have signed H. R. 1776.
Through this legislation, our country has determined to do its full part in .creating an adequate arsenal of democracy. This great arsenal will be here in this country. It will be a bulwark of our own defense. It will be the source of the tools of defense for all democracies who are fighting to preserve themselves against aggression.
While the defense equipment produced under H. R. 1776 remains under the control of the United States until it is ready for disposition, it is the fixed policy of this Government to make for .democracies every gun, plane, and munition of war that we possibly call.
To accomplish these objectives, I am transmitting an estimate in the amount of $7,000,000,000, the details of which are set forth in the accompanying letter from the Director of the Bureau of the Budget. I strongly urge the immediate enactment of this appropriation.
Respectfully,

Honorable Sam Rayburn,

Speaker, House of Representatives,

Washington, D. C.
