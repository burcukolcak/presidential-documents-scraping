Appointment of a Committee on Coordinating Foreign Relief
I am enclosing a copy of a letter I have received from the Secretary of State with regard to certain problems existing in the field of foreign relief. I would be grateful if you would be good enough to serve on a committee of three I would like to appoint for the purpose of making a thorough canvass of this situation and making recommendations with regard to the best methods of dealing with the problems which have arisen therein.
It would be appreciated if the committee would arrange to meet in Washington at an early date, at which time I will be glad to put at its disposal such information on the subject as may be available.
Very sincerely yours,
Franklin D. Roosevelt
