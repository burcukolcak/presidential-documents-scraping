Franklin D. Roosevelt
March 15, 1939

Tribute to the Late J. D. Ross, Administrator of the Bonneville Project.
It is fitting that every American should know of the passing of one of the greatest Americans of our generation. Mr. J. D. Ross, fighting against illness, built for himself a strong body and a brilliant mind in the building of Alaska and later of the Pacific Northwest. An outstanding mathematician and an equally great engineer, he combined with this the practical ability to make things work in the sphere of public opinion and successful business. More than that, he was a philosopher, and a student and lover of trees and flowers.
His successful career and especially his long service in behalf of the public interest are worthy of study by every American boy.
My personal affection for him grew with the years and because so many people leaned on him for so much of inspiration and advice, his place in our country will be almost impossible to fill.
