Letter Against Politics in Relief.
My dear Mr. Hopkins:
I have examined the evidence concerning corrupt political interference with relief in the State of Ohio. Such interference cannot be tolerated Â£or a moment. I wish you to pursue these investigations diligently and let the chips fall where they may. This Administration will not permit the relief population of Ohio to become the innocent victims of either corruption or political chicanery.
You are authorized and directed forthwith to assume entire control of the administration of Federal relief in the State of Ohio.
Very sincerely yours,
Honorable Harry L. Hopkins,

Federal Emergency Relief Administration,

Washington, D. C.
