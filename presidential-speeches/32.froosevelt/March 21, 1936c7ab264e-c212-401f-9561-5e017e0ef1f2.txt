Statement on Funds for Repairs and Replacement of Public Property Damaged by Floods.
The President today allocated to the Works Progress Administration $25,000,000 for repairs or replacement of publicly owned property or utilities which have been destroyed or damaged by floods. This sum, which is in addition to an emergency allotment of $18,411,633 made on February 29, will be apportioned to the stricken States as needed.
In making the allocation, the President has given the Works Progress Administration blanket authority to restore roads, streets, bridges, sewers, water and electric plants, and other damaged public properties. The funds previously made available will be used to fight the threat to health which has arisen in many quarters where the waters have receded.
The President pointed out that, with the exception of food and clothing furnished by the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation and from W.P.A. women's projects, direct relief needs were being met by the American Red Cross and by local welfare agencies in the stricken areas. W.P.A. funds generally, he said, would be spent in reestablishment of public improvements. . . .
