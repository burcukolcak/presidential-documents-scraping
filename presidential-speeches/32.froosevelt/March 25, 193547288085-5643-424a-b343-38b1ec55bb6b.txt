Letter on Code Compliance.
Dear Mr. Richberg:

Before leaving Washington I wish to answer your letter of today and to express to the National Industrial Recovery Board my desire that the full power of the National Recovery Administration shall be exerted to insist upon and to obtain compliance with the requirements of approved codes of fair competition. There is no excuse whatsoever at the present time for members of trade and industry who have sponsored and are subject to these codes to fail to give them wholehearted support. Nor can there be any justification for the bad faith involved in attempting to lengthen hours or reduce wages contrary to code requirements. I am particularly requesting the Department of Justice to give every assistance in maintaining compliance with the codes and in advising the District Attorneys throughout the country to take prompt and vigorous action to prevent or to punish such violations.
Let me also suggest that the National Industrial Recovery Board bring the facts of this situation to the attention of the appropriate committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives so that they may understand the importance of accelerating action to extend the National Industrial Recovery Act and to end a period of uncertainty as to the provisions and the extension of the law which has a retarding effect upon industrial recovery and tends to unsettle commercial and labor relations.
Very sincerely yours,

Honorable Donald R. Richberg,

Chairman, National Industrial Recovery Board,

Washington, D. C.
