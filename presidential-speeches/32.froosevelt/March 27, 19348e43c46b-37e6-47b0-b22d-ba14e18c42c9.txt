Letter on Public School Problems.
My dear Dr. Arps:
My I congratulate the organizers of the Citizens' Conference on the Crisis in Education for calling together leaders in American thought to consider ways and means of solving some of the critical problems that confront the schools of the Nation?
That our educational institutions have suffered much within the past few years is evident. Because of a lack of funds, thousands of schools have closed early this year and many have eliminated highly essential services.
Although the effects of the present lack of adequate educational opportunities on our national life may not be noticeable today, the time may soon come when dire effects will be apparent. It is, therefore, the responsibility of every American to see that the great strides that we have made in education since Colonial times shall not be lost. It is also his responsibility to see that the schools march forward, that the scope of education become such as to provide educational opportunities for every person from early childhood on into adult life. One group that we need to consider especially are the many youths who are not in school and who are apparently drifting.
I realize the seriousness of the problems that will be discussed at your Conference, but I am confident that after careful deliberation you will be able to formulate a plan of action. My great regret is that I find it impossible to participate in your deliberations upon so important a subject.
I send you my heartiest wishes for a fruitful and epoch-making Conference.
Very sincerely yours,
Dr. George F. Arps,
