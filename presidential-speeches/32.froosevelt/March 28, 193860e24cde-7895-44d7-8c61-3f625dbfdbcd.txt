Statement on the Death of Colonel House.
A great and unique figure has been lost to our national life in the death of Colonel House. The trusted friend and advisor in foreign affairs of a great war President, Colonel House possessed a sagacity, prudence, patriotism and integrity which made his counsels invaluable in one of the most critical periods of world history.
Few Americans have possessed in such degree the confidence of statesmen at home and abroad as did this modest and self-effacing man who placed his country's good and the good of humanity above all personal considerations.
As one who had long enjoyed the privilege of his friendship I shall miss his wise counsel and unvarying loyalty.
