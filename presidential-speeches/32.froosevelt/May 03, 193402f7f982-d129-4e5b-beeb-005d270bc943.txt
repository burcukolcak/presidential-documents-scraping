Franklin D. Roosevelt
May 03, 1934

Statement on the Death of Secretary of the Treasury William H. Woodin.
The President learned of Secretary Woodin's death shortly after 8 o'clock on the evening of May 3, 1934. He was at dinner when the news reached him. He announced the death to his dinner guests and said:
"I am very deeply shocked and distressed by the passing of my dear friend."
This statement was immediately given to the press for publication and a short time later the following statement was issued by the President's direction at the White House Executive Offices:
"It is known that both Mrs. Roosevelt and I have felt deep concern for Mr. Woodin's health ever since the days in the spring of 1933 when he declined to take adequate care of an ulcerated throat and insisted upon working day and night during the financial crisis of the Nation and on the many other problems which had to be solved. No man in time of war showed greater devotion or gave greater sacrifice than Secretary Woodin. He made a great place for himself in the hearts of all Americans and especially among those who, knowing him, loved him for himself."
The following personal telegram was sent to Mrs. William H. Woodin:
"It is impossible for us to tell you how deeply grieved we are at the news of Will's death. For several days we have been hoping against hope that he would rally. Eleanor and I want you to know, as you must know, that our hearts are with you in the loss of your dear husband and our dear friend.
"Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt"
Mrs. William H. Woodin,

2 East 67th Street,
