Appeal for Contributions to the American Red Cross.
The American Red Cross has issued an appeal for a war-relief fund of at least $10,000,000.
I urge all Americans who have a feeling of deep sympathy for the peoples of those unfortunate countries who today have been added to the long list of those who are suffering the horrors of invasion and aerial bombardment, to respond quickly and generously to this appeal.
The American Red Cross, our official national volunteer relief agency, is efficiently organized to answer such emergency calls. It is, therefore, the logical agency through which our citizens can express their compassion for the innocent victims of the wars that rage overseas. I am confident we will not fail them.
