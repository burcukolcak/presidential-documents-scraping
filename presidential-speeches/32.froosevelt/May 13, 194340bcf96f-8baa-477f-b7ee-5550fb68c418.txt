Message to Stalin.
Thank you for your message of congratulation on the performance of our forces in liberating Tunisia.
Now that we have the initiative, it is reasonable to expect further successes on both the Eastern and Western Fronts and further supplies, including air.
The message to Chiang Kai-shek.
For the Allied forces in the African theater of war, I should like to express appreciation of your message of congratulation on the complete destruction of the enemies of liberty in Africa.
We hope in the near future to take, together with your gallant Army, the initiative in Asia and bring to an end the war which you have for many years carried on successfully in spite of all difficulties.
