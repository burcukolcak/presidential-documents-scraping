Joint Statement with Finance Minister Pani of Mexico.
In the course of our conversations, it has been highly satisfactory to confirm that the judgment of the two Governments coincides not only as regards the imperative need of coordinated effort of all Nations to restore economic equilibrium in the world, but also, specifically, in connection with the outstanding subjects in the Agenda which, with such purpose, are to regulate the work at the London Conference.
Likewise, we have been able to determine general features for a future understanding looking to removing obstacles that are in the way of normal development of trade relations between the two Nations.
It is also of great interest to announce that, Mexico and the United States being the two main silver-producing countries in the world, a project of agreement toward the stabilization of the price of this metal has been the subject of special and fruitful consideration in these conversations.
We may justly expect, therefore, that as a result of these conversations there will be unalterable cooperation at the World Conference, and that soon normal trade between Mexico and the United States will be restored.
