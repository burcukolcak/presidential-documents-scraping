Letter Requesting Legislation to Help the Oil Industry.
The President sent to the Vice President and the Speaker of the House the following letter:
As the Congress is doubtless aware, a serious situation confronts the oil-producing industry. Because oil taken from the ground is a natural resource which once used cannot be replaced, it is of interest to the Nation that its production should be under reasonable control for the best interests of the present and future generations.
My Administration for many weeks has been in conference with the Governors of the oil-producing States and with component parts of the industry but it seems difficult, if not impossible, to bring order out of chaos only by State action. In fact, this is recognized by most of the Governors concerned.
There is a widespread demand for Federal legislation. May I request that this subject be given immediate attention by the appropriate committee or committees? The Secretary of the Interior stands ready to present any information or data desired.
May I suggest further that in order to save the time of the Special Session it might be possible to incorporate action relating to the oil industry with whatever action the Congress decides to take in regard to other industriesâ€”in other words, that consideration could be given at the same time that action is taken on the bills already introduced and now pending in committee?
