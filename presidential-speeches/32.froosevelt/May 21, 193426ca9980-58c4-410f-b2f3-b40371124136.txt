Telegrams on the Settlement of the Dispute between Colombia and Peru.
I desire to send to Your Excellency my heartiest congratulations on the settlement of the Leticia question. In my judgment, this proof that two great Republics of the American Continent can resolve the difficulties which had arisen between them through peaceful adjustment furnishes an example to the entire world, of which my countrymen in common with all the other peoples of the American Republics may be justly proud.
His Excellency, Senor Doctor Don Enrique Olaya Herrera, President of Colombia, Bogota, Colombia.
