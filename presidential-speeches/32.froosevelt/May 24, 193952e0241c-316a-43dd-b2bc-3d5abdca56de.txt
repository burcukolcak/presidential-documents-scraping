Letter on Resale Price-Fixing Legislation in the District of Columbia.
My dear Mr. President:
MY ATTENTION has been called to H.R. 3838, which would render legal in the District of Columbia contracts for the maintenance of resale prices. A study of "fair trade acts," which is a term applied to resale price maintenance statutes, has been begun by the Federal Trade Commission, and the Temporary National Economic Committee has under consideration a study of general marketing laws, including fair trade acts and statutes having to do with prices and price policies.
In view thereof, this bill should not, in my judgment, receive the consideration of the Congress until the aforesaid studies of the subject matter of such legislation have been reported upon by the Temporary National Economic Committee and by the Federal Trade Commission.
Very sincerely yours,
Hon. John N. Garner,

President, United States Senate,

Washington, D. C.
