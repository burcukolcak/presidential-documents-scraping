Letter to Governor John G. Winant of Hew Hampshire Regarding Minimum Employment Standards.
My dear Governor Winant:
The Secretary of Labor has told me that on Tuesday, May 29th, representatives of the States of Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania are to convene at Concord, New Hampshire, under your chairmanship, to consider and to act upon a draft of an interstate compact establishing uniform minimum standards for conditions of employment.
You may recall that in January, 1931, when I was Governor of the State of New York, I called the first conference of officials of the Northeastern States to consider the possibility of proceeding by joint State action to maintain and improve industrial and labor standards. Because this meeting on the 29th of May is, at least in part, an outgrowth of our earlier discussions in Albany, I naturally have a deep personal satisfaction in it. But my interest goes much further, for the State action now proposed is complementary to the national action already taken in Washington to give American citizens a more ample and more secure life.
I hope you will extend to the representatives and guests who attend the conference my good wishes and my heartiest congratulations upon their substantial accomplishment.
Very sincerely yours,
Honorable John G. Winant,

Concord, New Hampshire
