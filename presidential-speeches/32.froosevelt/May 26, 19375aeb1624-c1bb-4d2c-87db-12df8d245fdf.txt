Greeting to the National Seaway Council.
Mr. Fred J. Freestone.
Chairman National Seaway Council,
New York, N. Y.
Your letter of May twenty-first transmitting resolutions adopted by the National Seaway Council favoring early construction of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Waterway and Power Project is deeply appreciated. I am in complete agreement with your declaration that "Further delay in its completion, with continued loss of transportation savings and waste of power, cannot be reconciled with sound policies of economy and conservation of our natural resources." My interest in and enthusiasm for this important project has constantly increased and I propose to do everything within my power to bring about an agreement which will start its construction at the earliest possible date. Please convey to the members of the Council my hearty congratulations on the splendid accomplishments achieved during its first year of activity and my best wishes for its continuing success.
