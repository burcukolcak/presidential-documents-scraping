Statement on to the Red Cross Membership Drive.
Each year, during the period from Armistice Day to Thanksgiving, the American Red Cross appeals to our people for the membership support which makes possible the continuance of its work through the coming year. It is the aim of this great organization of mercy to enroll as many Americans as possible so that they will have a conscious share in its service to humanity-local, national, and international- through individual membership.
It is with a feeling of deep pride and gratitude that we look back upon the accomplishments of the Red Cross during the year, when the country was faced with the gravest disaster in its peace-time history. Acting as our national relief agency, the Red Cross gave practical assistance to more than a million people driven from their homes by the floods which swept through the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. During the same twelve months, the organization brought speedy and efficient relief to the victims of more than one hundred other disasters which visited our people.
In order that the ever increasing calls for Red Cross service may be met promptly wherever and whenever they are sounded, it is of the utmost importance that we further increase the popular support always given to this great organization. I, therefore, urge our people everywhere to respond generously and promptly to the Red Cross membership roll call.
