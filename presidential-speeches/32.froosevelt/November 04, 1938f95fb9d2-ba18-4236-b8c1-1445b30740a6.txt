Statement on Senator Wagner of New York
When we were in the Legislature together more than a quarter of a century ago, Senator Wagner and I were called Communists and Socialists because we worked for a fifty-four hour a week law for women and children in industry; for a full crew law for railroad trains; for factory inspection and workmen's compensation. Today we are proud of that old record.
Today we are called Communists and Socialists because we are trying to provide old age pensions, unemployment insurance and slum clearance and peacefully and equitably to solve problems of labor and capital which have accumulated without treatment for over thirty years. Tomorrow we shall be proud of that record too.
