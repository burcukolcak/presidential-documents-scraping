Remarks to Neighbors on Return to Washington.
My friends, I am very glad to come back among you, my old neighbors.
I formed a very good habit of coming to Washington when I was five years old; and I am glad that that habit will not be broken during the coming four years.
I have seen Washington grow during this half century and as an American I am very proud and happy in this wonderful Capital of ours. It is not only the most beautiful city in all the world but I think it is one of the grandest cities to live in in all the world.
This is a very wonderful greeting that you have given to me on this wonderful day. I am very thankful to you and hope to see much of you in the next four years.
