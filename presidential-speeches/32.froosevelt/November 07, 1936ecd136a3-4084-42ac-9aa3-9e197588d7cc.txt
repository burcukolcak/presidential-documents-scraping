Greeting to the Third National Conference on Labor Legislation.
My dear friends:
I wish to send you my hearty greetings, and to welcome to Washington this large and representative gathering of State officials and representatives of organized labor. The sessions of the National Conference on Labor Legislation in 1934 and 1935 formulated a program for the raising of labor standards which commands my whole-hearted sympathy and approval, and that of my Administration. Furthermore, I believe the country has this last week given a mandate in unmistakable terms to its legislators and executives to proceed along these lines until working people throughout the Nation and in every State are assured decent working conditions, including safe and healthful places of work; adequate care and support when incapacitated by reason of accident, industrial disease, unemployment, or old age; reasonably short working hours; adequate annual incomes; proper housing; and elimination of child labor.
I hope that your Conference will give serious consideration as to how these objectives may be achieved and that when you return to your States you will assume the leadership in your communities for putting the necessary legislation on the statute books. I assure you that the Federal Government is willing to do its part in making these standards effective, and in supplementing the efforts of the States when problems assume an interstate or a national character. This coming year should be an outstanding one in the annals of labor legislation. I am indeed sorry that I cannot personally attend your sessions, but I assure you that I shall follow the outcome with a great deal of interest.
Sincerely yours,
