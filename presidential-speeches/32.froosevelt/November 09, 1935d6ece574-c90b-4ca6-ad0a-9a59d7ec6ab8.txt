Joint Statement with W. Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of Canada.
The President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Canada have considered the question of increased trade which has been discussed for some time by representatives of the two Nations. There is complete agreement on the objective of a greatly increased flow of trade for the benefit of both countries and substantial progress has been made toward this end. It is recognized that such an increase would be beneficially felt in all activities, because trade is but another word for increased employment, transportation and consumption.
