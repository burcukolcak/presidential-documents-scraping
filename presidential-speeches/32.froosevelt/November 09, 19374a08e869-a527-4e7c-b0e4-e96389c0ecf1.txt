Statement on Cooperation with the Unemployment Census.
A highly important task which confronts our nation today is finding jobs for willing workers who, through no fault of their own, are unable to find work for which they are suited.
The problem is both social and economic. Our mental wellbeing requires the removal of fear from the minds of those below the border line of necessity. Our economic well-being calls for the stimulus that wages, paid in exchange for productive labor, will add to our national income.
To put all willing workers to work calls for long-term planning. Long-term planning calls for facts.
We shall learn the facts of unemployment if all our people employed as well as unemployedâ€”cooperate in the Unemployment Census to be inaugurated on Tuesday when the postmen will distribute blanks to every home.
I appeal to all unemployed and to the partly unemployed to give us the facts by answering the fourteen questions and mailing these cards, without postage, by November twentieth.
The men and women who are unemployed are our problem. We must help them back to re-employment. The task before us is vast enough and important enough to call for the utmost of national cooperation- from labor; from industry; from agriculture, and government. Those who are employed can help by calling the attention of their unemployed neighbors to the duty of registering in this census.
Thus every element in the community can help those who need help. It is all in the spirit of helpfulness- the spirit of the good neighbor applied at home.
