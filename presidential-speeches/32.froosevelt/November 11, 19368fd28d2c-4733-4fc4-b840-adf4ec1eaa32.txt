Greeting to the National Reclamation Association.
My dear Mr. Warden:
The National Reclamation Association was organized to encourage the conservation of water, the greatest Western resource, and its use for irrigation. The program under the Federal reclamation policy has steadily gone forward and has relieved unemployment not only in the West, but in the industrial East where these Western developments create a market for the products of the factories. The prolonged drought has given added emphasis to the benefits of irrigation.
To the annual gathering of your Association in Spokane, November 23d and 24th, I send my greetings and best wishes for a successful meeting. Your achievements as a group are very gratifying, particularly in educating the public as to the place Federal reclamation takes in our economic existence and in helping administrative officers preserve a sound policy.
Very sincerely yours,
Mr. O. S. Warden, President,

National Reclamation Association,

Helena, Montana.
