Remarks at Greenbelt, Md.
Although I have seen the blueprints of Greenbelt, the sight of the project far exceeds anything I dreamed of.
I wish everyone in the country could see it. It's a splendid thing to have near both Baltimore and Washington. The project is an achievement that ought to be copied in every city in the Nation.
It's a good thing to get people out into the country, but more than that, it benefits the low-income groups.
