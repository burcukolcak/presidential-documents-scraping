Message to the Grange.
To the members of the Grange:
For many years, as you know, I have been a member of the Grange. I have felt at home in it because it embodies the fine flavor of rural living which I myself have known and loved. Beyond this it has been an instrument for expressing in useful activity the highest sentiments and deepest loyalties of Americans. Now, as perhaps never before, the Grange has an opportunity to extend its service to Agriculture and to the Nation in helping to adapt the democratic process to an age of fundamental economic change. Only from the thoughts and efforts of such groups as the members of the Grange can the new American democracy be built to stand the tests of time.
Mr. L. J. Taber, Master, The National Grange, Hartford, Connecticut
