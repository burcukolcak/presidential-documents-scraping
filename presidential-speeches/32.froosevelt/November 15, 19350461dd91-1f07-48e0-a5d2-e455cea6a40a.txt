Franklin D. Roosevelt
November 15, 1935

Excerpts from the Press Conference
Q. Mr. President, I was wondering if you read the statement by Senator Norris that he might not run again in 1936? I was wondering, if you had, if you would care to comment.
The President: I understood there was a question as to whether he had made it.
Q. I read several versions of it.
The President: I don't see why I should not say something about it. It is perfectly clear, I feel. It is the kind of thing you can say about a very few individuals in the United States, and George Norris happens to be one of them. Put in this way: If I were a citizen of the State of Nebraska, regardless of what party I belonged to, I would not allow George Norris to retire from the United States Senate, whether he wanted to or not, for the very good reason that I feel that he is necessary not only to Nebraska, but to the United States as long as he lives.
