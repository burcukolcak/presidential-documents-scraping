Letter via Sky-Mail to the President of the Philippines.
My dear Mr. President:
It is a great pleasure for me to send you this word of greeting by the first airplane to carry the mails between the United States and the Philippine Islands.
I feel that the more rapid communications which will inevitably follow the inauguration of this service will result in increased benefits to the trade and intercourse between the United States and the Philippines. I am, my dear Mr. President,
Very sincerely yours,
The Honorable Manuel L. Quezon,

President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines,
