Statement on a Report of the National Resources Committee.
The rapid organization and progress of forty-six State Planning Boards, the accomplishments of which are outlined in the report of the National Resources Committee, show that the people of our country understand and want long-range planning and foresight in public affairs. To give lasting substance and direction to planning for the wise use of our human and natural resources, we need permanent advisory planning boards for towns, cities, counties, States and the Nation.
The report prepared for the President by the National Resources Committee summarizes the activities and progress of the State Planning Boards organized throughout the country in the last two years. It presents recommendations that Federal assistance to the State units be continued. The work of the State Boards in the field of land use, water resources, social problems, public construction, electric power problems and mineral resources, etc., is described. The Committee's survey of the organization of the State Planning Boards shows that nearly 500 leading citizens of forty-six States have actively participated in the work of State planning.
