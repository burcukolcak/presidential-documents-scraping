Letter on Monopolistic Practices Raising Living Costs.
My dear Mr. Ayres:
My attention has been directed to reports of a marked increase in the cost of living during the present year, as compared with recent years past, attributable in part to monopolistic practices and other unwholesome methods of competition.
I believe it to be important to know the facts touching this situation, and, therefore, request the Federal Trade Commission to make an immediate investigation into such alleged practices and methods and report to me as early as practicable.
I understand such inquiry can be made without any increase in your current appropriation.
Very sincerely yours,
Honorable W. A. Ayres,

Chairman, Federal Trade Commission,

Washington, D.C.
