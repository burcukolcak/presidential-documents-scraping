Tribute to the Late Justice Pierce Butler of the Supreme Court.
I have known Justice Butler for a great many years and I always regarded him as a personal friend. His undoubtedly great ability, his complete frankness in the expression of his philosophy and his honest convictions, commanded my respect and, in common with his many friends, I sincerely regret his untimely passing.
