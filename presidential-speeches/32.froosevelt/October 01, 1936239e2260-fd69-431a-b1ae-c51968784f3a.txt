Rear-Platform Remarks at Fairmont, W. Va.
I am glad to come back to Fairmont and to note that it is a much more prosperous-looking community than the last time I was here.
I am glad to be here with Senator Neely and Governor Kump and your Congressman and also your next Governor.
I received a telegram a few moments ago on the train and through you good people I am going to make an announcement about it. The telegram reports that for the first time in fifty-five years we have completed one full year without a single national bank failure in the United States. From that, I am inclined to think that the banks of the United States are safer than they have been in fifty-five years.
I have been much interested in seeing that great dam that is under construction farther up-stream. The engineer in charge told me that in July and in August of this year there has been a greater tonnage of water-borne freight on the Monongahela River than on any other stream in the United States.
I am glad that the Federal Government is thus cooperating with the communities of this part of the country. I call it pretty successful cooperative boondoggling.
It is good to be with you and I hope to come back one of these days soon. Many thanks.
