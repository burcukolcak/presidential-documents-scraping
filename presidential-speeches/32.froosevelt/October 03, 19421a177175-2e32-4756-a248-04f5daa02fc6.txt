Letters to Leon Henderson on Ceiling Prices for Certain Foods and Rent Control.
I have signed the cost of living stabilization bill.
I wish that you would consult with the Secretary of Agriculture and immediately establish ceiling prices for eggs, chickens, butter, cheese, potatoes, flour, and such other foods as can be controlled under existing laws.
In line with my recent message to the Congress, you should consider present governmental payments to agricultural producers, and subsidy payments in arriving at the minimum ceiling prices.
This Government is determined to use all of its powers to prevent any avoidable rise in the cost of living.
That part of the Nation which has not yet been designated within defense rental areas should now be so treated. We should make no distinction between city and country residents as to their participation in the total war effort. Certainly the contribution of agriculture to the effective prosecution of the war is clear. Therefore, our rural population equally deserves to have its rents stabilized.
I wish you would immediately issue appropriate orders to prevent rent increases on urban and rural dwellings. In such areas as you deem appropriate to reduce current rents, I am sure you will proceed to take such action as may be necessary.
