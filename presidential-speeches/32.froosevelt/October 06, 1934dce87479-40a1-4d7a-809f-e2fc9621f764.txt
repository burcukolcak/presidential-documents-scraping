Letter to Robert Fechner Congratulating the C.C.C.
Dear Mr. Fechner:
I have been greatly interested and encouraged by the fine report of your visits to C.C.C. camps in many parts of the country.
This kind of work must go on. I believe that the Nation feels that the work of these young men is so thoroughly justified and, in addition, the benefits to the men themselves are so clear that the actual annual cost will be met without much opposition or much complaint.
Very sincerely yours,
Hon. Robert Fechner,

Civilian Conservation Corps,

Washington, D. C.
