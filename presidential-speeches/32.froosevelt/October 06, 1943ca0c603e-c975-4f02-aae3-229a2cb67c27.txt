Remarks at the Dedication of Four Bombers for Yugoslavian Service.
Mr. Ambassador, General Giles, members of the first Yugoslav air force trained in this country:
I am very happy to take part in this most interesting ceremony. I am happy also that you gentlemen are going to wear as members of the Yugoslav Air Force the wings of the United States Air Force.
May these planes fulfill their mission under your guidance. They are built with two great objectives. The first is to drop bombs on our common enemy successfully and at the right points. The second is to deliver to your compatriots in Yugoslavia the much-needed supplies for which they have waited so long-food, medicineâ€”yes, arms and ammunition.
And so you fare forth on one of the greatest odysseys of this war. I count on you to bear yourselves well. And I am sure you will have every success in this great mission that you are undertaking. Remember always that we are comrades in arms.
