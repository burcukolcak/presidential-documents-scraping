Statement on the Presentation by the French Ambassador of a Sabre of Honor Made for George Washington.
Accompanied by H. E., Mr. Andre de Laboulaye, the French Ambassador, General de Chambrun this morning presented to the President, on behalf of the President of the Council, a Sabre of Honor which was made especially for George Washington, whose death took place before the presentation could be made.
In accepting the sabre, President Roosevelt announced that it, together with the letter of transmittal, would hang directly beneath the portrait of General Washington at the White House.
General de Chambrun, in presenting the sabre, delivered the following letter from the President of the French Council to President Roosevelt:
TRANSLATION
"OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL"
Paris, September 21, 1933.
"To His Excellency, President Roosevelt
"Mr. President:
"I am charging General de Chambrun to offer to Your Excellency the Sabre of Honor which the French Volunteers had made at the celebrated works at Klingenthal (Alsace) to send to George Washington.
"The death of the hero took place before the gift could be sent to him; but the token of admiration of the French soldiers of the Revolution still keeps, despite the lapse of time, its value as a symbol, and the Government of the Republic takes pleasure in renewing, to Washington's successor, the homage of a free people to the noblest figure of the struggles for Liberty.
"I have chosen for this mission General de Chambrun, a descendant of Lafayette, in order thus to attest the community of memories and the continuity of the ties which unite to France the great Republic of the United States.
"Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my high consideration and my cordial sentiments.
(s) "Ed. Daladier."
