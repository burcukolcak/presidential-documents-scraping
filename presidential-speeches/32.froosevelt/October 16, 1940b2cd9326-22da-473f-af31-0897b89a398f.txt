Franklin D. Roosevelt
October 16, 1940

Message to Selective Service Registrants.
I WISH I could personally talk to each one of you about our country's pressing need for a stronger defense, and its vital meaning to you, your family, and the whole Nation. I would tell you that the task before us today is as compelling as any that ever confronted our people, and I would add that each of us must willingly do his bit if we are to hold fast our heritage of freedom and our American way of lifeâ€”our national existence itself.
And whether or not you are to be among those selected, I welcome you as one whose name has been inscribed on the roll of honor of those Americans ready, if need be, to join in the common defense of all.
