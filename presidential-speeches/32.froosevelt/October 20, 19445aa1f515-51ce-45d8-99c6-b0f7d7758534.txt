Franklin D. Roosevelt
October 20, 1944

Congratulations to General MacArthur
The whole American Nation today exults at the news that the gallant men under your command have landed on Philippine soil. I know well what this means to you. I know what it cost you to obey my order that you leave Corregidor in February, 1942, and proceed to Australia. Since then you have planned and worked and fought with whole-souled devotion for the day when you would return with powerful forces to the Philippine Islands. That day has come. You have the Nation's gratitude and the Nation's prayers for success as you and your men fight your way back to Bataan.
