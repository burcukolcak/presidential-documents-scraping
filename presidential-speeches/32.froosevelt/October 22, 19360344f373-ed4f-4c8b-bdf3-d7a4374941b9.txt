Tribute to Senator James Couzens on the Occasion of His Death.
In the death of Senator Couzens the Senate of the United States and the people of Michigan and the Nation have lost a leader whose convictions were a part of the best that America aspires for and whose courage was a match for his idealism.
Senator Couzens did not enter public life because he sought either fame or power, but rather because of a service he believed he could render to the cause of progressive thought and political uprightness. He was a party member. But his prior obligation was to the well-being of the people whom he served. He never hesitated in that service.
The death of Senator Couzens to me is a great loss. But, more than that, it is a great loss to the multitudes of Americans whose needs and problems were always in the forefront of his thought and action.
