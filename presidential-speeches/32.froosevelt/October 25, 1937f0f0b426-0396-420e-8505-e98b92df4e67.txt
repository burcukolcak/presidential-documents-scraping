Greeting to the National Conference on Labor Legislation.
My dear Friends:
I had hoped that this year I would have the opportunity to meet the delegates to the National Conference on Labor Legislation but I find that other important engagements will take me out of the city during the days that you are here. I am therefore asking the Secretary of Labor to convey to you my greetings and hearty good wishes for a successful conference.
I have followed with great interest the progress that has been made in State labor legislation during this administration, and particularly during the past year. You will recall that at your last conference I urged you to assume leadership in your communities for putting legislation on the statute books assuring the working people safe and healthful places of work; adequate care and support when incapacitated by reason of accident, industrial disease or old age; a short work day and work week; adequate wages; proper housing, and the elimination of child labor. I now congratulate you on the extent to which you have been successful in bringing about these much needed improvements.
I have called a special session of Congress to enact, among other things, a wage and hour bill which I hope will supplement and strengthen your legislation in behalf of workers. In the administration of the Federal legislation we shall need your active participation so that by joint effort we may develop a fuller protection to the workers of the country than either the Federal Government alone or the States could achieve in their respective jurisdictions.
I hope that your discussions of administrative problems will serve to focus attention on the importance of further administration as your deliberations in previous years have focused attention on legislative standards.
Sincerely yours,
