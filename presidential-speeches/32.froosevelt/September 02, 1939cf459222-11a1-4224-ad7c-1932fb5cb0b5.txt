Invitations to Foreign Nations to Continue Participation in the New York World's Fair.
I have today authorized an invitation to the foreign countries and nations participating in the New York World's Fair, to continue their participation in 1940. I take particular pleasure in extending this invitation at this particular time.
The World is disturbed by armed strife but the continuing ideal of all nations must be a world of peace. The continuing emphasis of nations must be on the progress of civilization, and not on its destruction.
The continuing hope of the nations must be that they will increasingly understand each other. The New York World's Fair is one of the many channels by which this continuing conception of peace may be made known.

The duty rests on all of us to keep these channels open.
