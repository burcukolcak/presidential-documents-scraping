Letter to Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd on the Departure of His Antarctic Expedition.
My dear Dick:

I am delighted that you have had the faith to go ahead with this scientific expedition to the Antarctic Continent and that you have definitely set the date of departure for September 25th.
It is because you and I are such old friends, and because I have followed so closely your three previous expeditions, that I expect to keep in close touch with your new expedition.
I realize the importance of your excellent preparations for scientific discovery, and the fact that you will make a detailed survey of a large area of new continent previously unexplored. It is worth while to serve twelve branches of science.
I am especially interested in the exhaustive study of weather on the Antarctic Continentâ€”a territory in the clutches of the ice age, and a weather maker for the greater part of the South American Continent. Your weather observations will undoubtedly be of great importance to South America and to the scientific knowledge of world weather conditions.
From a sentimental point of view I am delighted that you are using the famous old Coast Guard revenue cutter Bear, and I wish much that I could see you and the expedition of[ when you sail.
I want you to feel that on your expedition you have the full support of the United States Government and that you can call on the Government in case of need or emergency.
When you reestablish the post office at Little America be sure to send me a letter for my stamp collection. Good luck to you and all of your associates and crews.

Always sincerely yours,

Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd,

9 Brimmer Street, Boston, Mass.
