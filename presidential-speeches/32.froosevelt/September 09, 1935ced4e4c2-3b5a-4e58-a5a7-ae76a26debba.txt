Statement on the Murder of Senator Huey P. Long.
I deeply regret the attempt made upon the life of Senator Long, of Louisiana. The spirit of violence is un-American and has no place in a consideration of public affairs, least of all at a time When calm and dispassionate approach to the difficult problems of the day is so essential.
