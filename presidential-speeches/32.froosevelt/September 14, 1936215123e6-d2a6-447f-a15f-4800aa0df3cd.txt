Letter to a Policeman Injured while Safeguarding the President.
My dear Mr. Mangum:
I have learned with very great regret that you were injured Sunday evening while safeguarding my return to the White House.
I cannot resist the impulse to assure you of my sincere appreciation of your effort in my behalf. I do hope that your injuries are not serious and that you will have a speedy recovery.
Very sincerely yours,
Mr. Percy G. Mangum,

Washington, D. C.
