Statement on the Transportation of Arms and Munitions to China or Japan.
Merchant vessels owned by the Government of the United States will not hereafter, until further notice, be permitted to transport to China or Japan any of the arms, ammunition, or implements of war which were listed in the President's Proclamation of May 1, 1937.
Any other merchant vessels, flying the American flag, which attempt to transport any of the listed articles to China or Japan will, until further notice, do so at their own risk.
The question of applying the Neutrality Act remains in status quo, the Government policy remaining on a 24-hour basis.
