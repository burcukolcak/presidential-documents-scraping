Greeting to the Convention of the American Philatelic Society.
My dear Mr. Klein:
As one stamp collector to a fellowship which knows so well the compensations of the hobby, I send hearty felicitations to all who attend the annual convention of the American Philatelic Society. The best thing about stamp collecting as a pursuit is that the enthusiasm which it arouses in youth increases as the years pass. It dispels boredom, enlarges our vision, broadens our knowledge of geography and in innumerable ways enriches life and adds to its joys.
Very sincerely yours,
Mr. Eugene Klein,

American Philatelic Society,

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
