(b) The National Youth Administration in the Federal Security Agency, and its functions, duties, and powers.
(c) The Apprenticeship Training Service in the Office of the Federal Security Administrator, and its functions, duties, and powers, including those relating to the program to encourage apprentice training in national defense industries.
(d) The Training Within Industry Service in the Office of the Federal Security Administrator, and its functions, duties, and powers.
The Apprenticeship Training Service and the National Youth Administration shall be preserved as organizational entities within the War Manpower Commission.
2. The following functions, duties, and powers are transferred to the Chairman of the War Manpower Commission:
(a) All functions, duties, and powers of the Federal Security Administrator relating to the administration of any agency or function transferred by paragraph 1 of this order.
(b) All functions, duties, and powers of the Federal Security Administrator relating to the following matters administered by the Office of Education: loans to students in technical and professional fields (national defense); education and training, defense workers (national defense); and visual aids for war training (national defense).
3. All records and property (including office equipment, contracts, agreements, and leased office space) used primarily in the administration of any agency, function, duty, or power transferred by this order, and all personnel used primarily in the administration of such agencies, functions, duties, and powers (including officers whose chief duties relate to such administration) are transferred to the War Manpower Commission for use in the administration of the agencies, functions, duties, and powers transferred by this order. So much of the unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, or other funds available for the use of any agency in the exercise of any function, duty, or power transferred by this order or for the use of the head of any agency in the exercise of any function, duty, or power so transferred, as the Director of the Bureau of the Budget shall determine, shall be transferred to the War Manpower Commission, for use in connection with the exercise of functions, duties, and powers so transferred. In determining the amounts to be transferred, the Director of the Bureau of the Budget may include an amount to provide for the liquidation of obligations incurred against such appropriations, allocations, or other funds prior to the transfer.
4. In order to maintain, to the maximum extent consistent with the effective prosecution of the war, the essential coordination and integration of public employment service and unemployment compensation functions, and to avoid any necessity for establishing duplicate public employment office facilities, the Chairman of the War Manpower Commission is directed to provide for making available to agencies charged with the administration of unemployment compensation laws, such services, information, and facilities by the United States Employment Service and its public employment offices as the Chairman of the War Manpower Commission finds will not be inconsistent with the effective prosecution of the war and as the Social Security Board finds necessary for the proper and efficient administration of such unemployment compensation laws.
