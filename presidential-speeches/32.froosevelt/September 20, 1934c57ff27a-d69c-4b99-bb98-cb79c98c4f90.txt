Statement on the Receipt of a Report on the Cotton Textile Strike.
The excellent report of the board of inquiry for the Cotton Textile Industry presents findings and recommendations which cover the basic sources of difficulties, and does this in a way which shows the wholly fair and reasonable approach with which the board undertook its task.
It is, I think, a good example of the practical way in which industrial problems can be calmly discussed and solved under a republican form of government.
It is, of course, greatly to be hoped that a fair solution can be had because of the good-will and intelligence which undoubtedly exist in the industry as a whole including both workers and plant owners.
