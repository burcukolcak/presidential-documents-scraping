Letter to J. I. Banash on the Prevention of Accidents.
My dear Mr. Banash:

The conservation of human life and the prevention of accidental injury are of vital importance to our welfare and happiness. While much progress has been made in accident prevention during the past two decades, particularly in the field of industry, there is still much that should be done.
We sacrificed 88,000 lives through accidents last year. Approximately 9,000,000 people were injured. The economic costs run close to two billion dollars. The social cost is immeasurable. Briefly stated, that is our national accident problem, and it certainly offers a most serious challenge to the American people.
I extend my cordial greetings and best wishes with the hope that you will find abundant inspiration for intensified efforts in all fields of human activities throughout the coming year.

Very sincerely yours,

Mr. J. I. Banash,

Chicago, Illinois
