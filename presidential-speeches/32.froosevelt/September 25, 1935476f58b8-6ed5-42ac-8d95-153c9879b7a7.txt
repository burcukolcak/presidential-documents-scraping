Greetings to the American Protestant Hospital Association.
My dear Doctor Jarrell:
It is with pleasure that I send my personal greetings to the American Protestant Hospital Association meeting in annual convention at St. Louis. I gladly embrace this opportunity to acknowledge the contributions you are making to human welfare.
Generous American people have always shown a disposition to help the afflicted and to make life happier for an ever-increasing percentage of the population. Our hospitals, and particularly those administered by non-profit religious organizations, symbolize better than any other institution the depth as well as the dynamic quality of this national characteristic.
This country at last is emerging from the great economic depression which has engulfed the entire Nation for six years and some parts of our population for a much longer period. Out of this experience there is evolving a keener appreciation of social values than obtained when our thinking was more individualistic.
Because of our changed and changing viewpoint regarding our social responsibilities, the hospitals are destined to grow in the important services they render communities. This growth, I think, will be along two major lines: first, to provide better treatment and better accommodations for the patients and thus return them to productive activity in minimum time; and, second, they will exert positive health influences and disseminate information on all matters concerning the health of communities.
With best wishes for the success of your meeting, I am
Very sincerely yours,
Reverend Charles Jarrell, D.D.,

President, American Protestant Hospital Assn.,
