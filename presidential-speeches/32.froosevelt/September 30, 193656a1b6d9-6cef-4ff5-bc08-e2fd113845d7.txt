Greeting to the Atlantic Deeper Waterways Association.
My dear Mr. Moore:
In my letter to your association last year it was my pleasure to point out to the members of the Atlantic Deeper Waterways Association the progress which had been made in harbor and waterway improvements along the Atlantic Coast with funds of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act. These meritorious public works have been continued and during the past fiscal year funds totalling more than $24,300,000 have been expended in the improvement of rivers and harbors on the eastern seaboard. This year has been noteworthy in witnessing the completion of the 1,435 mile inside route of the Intracoastal Waterway from Trenton, New Jersey, to Miami, Florida. Much credit for this accomplishment belongs to your association and it is to be congratulated therefor. Other waterway projects of permanent value to the nation sponsored by your organization have been completed or are progressing in a satisfactory manner.
It is a pleasure for me again to extend my greetings to the members of your association on the occasion of its twenty-ninth annual convention. Your organization, since its inception at Trenton in 1907, has been most active in sponsoring waterway improvements along the Atlantic Coast. I may say to you that these improvements are being prosecuted vigorously and that funds for the fiscal year 1937 amounting to $24,000,000 have been allotted to this purpose. Permit me to congratulate you on the success which has attended your efforts and express my appreciation of your continued interest in national waterway improvements which serve to increase business and industry, improve employment, and provide lasting benefits to the Nation's welfare.
Very sincerely yours,
Hon. J. Hampton Moore,

President, Atlantic Deeper Waterways Association,

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
