Statement by the President Concerning Benefits for Philippine Army Veterans.
ON FEBRUARY TWENTIETH, at the time of signing the Surplus Appropriation Rescission Act, I referred to a provision excluding Philippine Army veterans from various benefits provided by law in respect of military service, and stated that the Secretary of War, the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, and the United States High Commissioner had been asked to work out a suitable plan for prompt submission to the Congress.
It was expected that such a plan could be prepared by March fifteenth. The departments concerned have reported to me that the problem is receiving diligent study but that further time will be needed to work out a suitable program and prepare necessary legislation for its administration.
I want to state for the benefit of our comrades in the Philippines that the matter is receiving attention and is being expedited as much as possible. In the meantime the Army is making hospital services available as far as possible under existing law by postponing the discharge of personnel who are in need of hospitalization. It should not be overlooked moreover that in the Surplus Rescission Act previously mentioned the Congress has authorized payment of pensions to Philippine veterans and their families in the event of service-connected disability or death. It has been estimated that these pension disbursements will eventually total half a billion pesos.
Note: For the President's statement upon signing the rescission act see Item 38. A message to Congress dealing with benefits for Philippine veterans was transmitted on May 18 (see Item 122).
