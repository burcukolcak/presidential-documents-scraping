Statement by the President on Making Public the Report of the Commission on Migratory Labor.
I HAVE today received the report of the Commission on Migratory Labor which I appointed in June 1950. I asked this Commission to investigate the whole range of problems associated with the use of migratory labor to meet agricultural labor needs.
This report makes an impressive contribution to a subject which should be of serious concern to all of us. It will be useful to Government officials and the general public alike.
The report contains a careful and painstaking collection of the basic facts about social, economic, health, and educational conditions among migratory workers. It analyzes in detail the forces which have caused increasing use of migrants, particularly foreign workers, in agriculture. It deals systematically with basic public policy issues.
The report suggests that primary reliance must be placed on the use--and better use-of our domestic farm labor force. The report makes a number of suggestions and recommendations for Federal and State legislative and administrative action.
The report represents diligent and careful work on the part of the Commission and deserves the careful consideration of all of us-of the Congress, the executive agencies, and the general public.
I want to thank the members of this Commission for their efforts. Their contribution will assist greatly in developing fair and practical solutions to what is admittedly a complicated problem.
Note: The President's Commission on Migratory Labor was established on June 3, 1950, by Executive Order 10129 (3 CFR, 1949-1953 Comp., p. 317). For the White House statement announcing the establishment of the Commission, see 1950 volume, this series, Item 153.
The report of the Commission is entitled "Migratory Labor in American Agriculture" (Government Printing Office, 1951, 188 pp.).
