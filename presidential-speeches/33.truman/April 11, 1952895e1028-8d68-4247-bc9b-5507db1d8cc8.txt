Remarks at the Presentation of the Congressional Medal of Honor to 1st Lt. Lloyd Burke, USA, Cpl . Rodolfo Hernandez, USA, and T. Sgt. Harold E. Wilson, USMC.
IT HAS been my pleasure this morning to present Medals of Honor to 1st Lt. Lloyd Burke, United States Army, Cpl. Rodolfo Hernandez, United States Army, and T. Sgt. Harold E. Wilson of the United States Marine Corps.
These are wonderful citations. They show just exactly what the fiber of the American people is made of. They show exactly how the young men feel toward their Government. They show the sacrifices that they are willing to make to support and keep that Government a free one from now on.
They set an example which all of you ought to be proud to listen to, and I congratulate every single one of them. And I congratulate the corps to which they belong.

Thank you.
Note: The President spoke at 12:35 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. The text of the citations was not made public.
