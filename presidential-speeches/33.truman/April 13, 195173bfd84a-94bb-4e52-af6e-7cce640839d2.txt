Statement by the President on the Invitation to General MacArthur To Address a Joint Session of Congress.
I AM happy to learn from Speaker Rayburn that Congress is planning to invite General MacArthur to address the Members of both Houses. I regard it as fitting that Congress bestow this honor on one of our great military men.
