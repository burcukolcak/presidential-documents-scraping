Statement by the President on the Death of President Manuel Roxas of the Philippines.
I AM deeply shocked at the news of the sudden death of President Manuel Roxas of the Philippines. In his passing, the Philippine people have lost a great leader and the United States of America a true friend.
He assumed office as President when his war-ravaged country was faced with the most staggering problems. His untimely death in itself is evidence of the energy which he brought to the restoration of the Philippines and to the service of his people. The officials of this Government with whom he came in contact have been unanimous in their praise of his farseeing vision and statesmanship. His sure leadership of the people of the Philippines and his courageous faith in his country may well serve as an inspiration to the people of all lands.
