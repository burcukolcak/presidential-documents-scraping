Remarks Upon Receiving a Gift for the White House Presented by the french Ambassador.
THANK YOU very much, Mr. Ambassador. We shall place this beautiful clock and candelabra in the Red Room, and every visitor who goes through the White House will see it and thank the people of France, and the President of France, for giving it to us.
Note: The President spoke at 12:05 p.m. on the North Portico of the White House to Henri Bonnet, french Ambassador to the United States. In making the presentation the Ambassador said: "Mr. President:
"In the name of President Vincent Auriol, I have great pleasure in presenting to you for the renovated White House this musical clock and two candelabras as a token of the gratitude and friendship of the french people for the people of the United States.
"The clock and the candclabra were both acquired especially by the President of France on this occasion. The clock is mounted on a white marble base and is supported by two cupids astride bronze animals. Before the hour, the clock plays pastoral music of the 18th Century ("ariettes and musettes") on a miniature organ hidden in a gold case. It is the work of sculptor Gouttiere, one of the celebrated masters of that period."
