Statement by the President on the Death of Senator Vandenberg.
ARTHUR VANDENBERG was a patriot who always subordinated partisan advantage and personal interest to the welfare of the Nation.
In his passing the Senate has lost a pillar of strength in whom integrity was implicit in every decision he made and in every vote he cast during a long tenure. The Nation mourns a leader who had wisdom, fortitude, and courage. A grateful country will hold his memory in lasting remembrance.
The senior Senator from Michigan never gave hasty judgments. He formed his opinions only after deliberate study of every aspect of every problem that came before him. His courage was fortified by a good conscience. So he had no fear of the consequences to his personal fortunes when the time came for him to differ from men of great power and influence within his own party on the paramount issue of foreign policy.
Of course we know that his independence cost him dearly in everything save honor. But to him his country's welfare, the security of the Nation and a just and enduring peace in a world of free men were above and beyond all other considerations. He even risked health and life in the cause of peace. When the heat of controversy has subsided and the present conflict of principle and policy has been resolved, I believe that the verdict of history, rendered through the perspective of time, will be for Senator Vandenberg.
