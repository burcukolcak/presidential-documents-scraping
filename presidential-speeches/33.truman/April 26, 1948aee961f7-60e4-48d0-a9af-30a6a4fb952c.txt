Exchange of Messages With the Queen of the Netherlands.
I HAVE received with great pleasure and gratitude Your Majesty's telegram announcing the posthumous award to President Roosevelt of the Grand Cross of the Military Willems Order. I am sure that the late President would have been particularly proud of this honor, as he always felt a special esteem and admiration for Your Majesty and the people of the Netherlands.
