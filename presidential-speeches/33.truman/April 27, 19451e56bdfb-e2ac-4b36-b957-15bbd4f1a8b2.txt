Letter to Edwin W. Pauley Appointing Him as the President's Personal Representative on the Reparations Commission.
My dear Mr. Pauley:
I hereby designate you to act as my personal representative, with the rank of Ambassador, to represent and assist me in exploring, developing and negotiating the formulae and methods for exacting reparations from the aggressor nations in the current war.
In this matter, you will represent me in dealing with the other interested nations.
At the Crimea Conference, it was agreed that Germany would be obliged to the greatest extent possible to make reparations in kind for the damage caused by her to the Allied countries. It was further agreed that a commission would be established to consider the question of the extent and methods for collecting such reparations.
I wish you also to represent the United States and me personally as a member of that commission.
In all matters within your jurisdiction you will report to me personally and directly.
May I express my gratification at your willingness to assume this important but arduous mission.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: A statement by Mr. Pauley concerning reparations was released by the White House on the same day.
