The President's News Conference on the Rumor of German Surrender
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I was over here, as you can see, doing a little work, and this rumor got started. I had a call from San Francisco, and the State Department called me. I just got in touch with Admiral Leahy and had him call our Headquarters Commander in Chief in Europe, and there is no foundation for the rumor. That's all I have to say.
Q. May we quote you?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Q. Are you going to stand by?
THE PRESIDENT. I'm going to finish this work.
Note: President Truman's fourth news conference was held in his office at the White House at 10 p.m. on Saturday, April 28, 1945.
