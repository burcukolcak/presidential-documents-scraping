August 03, 1946

Statement by the President on the Review of the 1947 Budget.
IN ACCORD with previous practice I present at this time a review of the Federal Budget for the fiscal year 1947, as well as actual figures for the fiscal year 1946. This revision of the January Budget estimates takes into account not only the action on appropriations which the Congress has just completed, but also other new legislation adopted since January and changes in the economic outlook. In view of the mounting inflationary threat, I have instructed Federal agencies to take drastic action to hold down expenditures and keep the expected deficit to the minimum. This Review reflects the expected results of such budgetary action.
1. Summary: Budget Trends and Budget Policy
Total budget expenditures for the fiscal year 1947 are now estimated at 41.5 billion dollars, and net receipts at 39.6 billion dollars, leaving an estimated budget deficit of 1.9 billion dollars.
When budget and trust accounts are consolidated on a strictly cash basis, the Federal Government in the current fiscal year will take in 2.8 billion dollars more in the form of taxes and similar cash receipts from the public than it will pay out to the public. In spite of a deficit in the Budget, there will thus be a net absorption of purchasing power by the Federal Government in the fiscal year 1947.
The situation has changed materially since the January Budget was issued. Both expenditures and revenues are higher than were estimated then. The January Budget estimated a deficit of 4.5 billion dollars for the fiscal year 1947. I now expect a deficit of less than half that amount.
As I anticipated in my statement of April 11, the budget results for the fiscal year 1946 were much better than expected in January. Then a deficit of nearly 29 billion dollars was expected, about 8 billion dollars greater than actually occurred.
For the two fiscal years 1946 and 1947 combined, the budgetary improvement over the January estimate is very striking. At that time it was estimated that the deficits for the two years would total 33 billion dollars. An aggregate deficit of 22.6 billion dollars for the two years is now expected-a reduction of one-third. As a result the January estimate of a 271-billion-dollar public debt on June 30, 1947, is now reduced to 261 billion dollars, or 10 billion dollars less.
In less than two years the budget deficit has been cut from one of 53.9 billion dollars in the last full year of war to one of 1.9 billion dollars in this, the first full year after the end of fighting. This cut in the deficit reflects a substantial reduction in Government expenditures, with taxes maintained at a high level.
Federal outlays will be reduced from the 100-billion-dollar wartime peak to 41.5 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1947--an expenditure still heavily loaded with war-related outlays. Revenues are expected to decline much less than expenditures--despite the effects of the Revenue Act of 1945 from a 46.5-billion-dollar wartime peak to 39.6 billion dollars. The contraction in wartime expenditures reflects more than a 90 percent cut in munitions procurement, rapid demobilization of the armed forces and considerable curtailment in civilian Federal personnel.
The strength of the armed forces has been reduced from a wartime peak of 12.3 million to the present level of about 2.7 million; it will be further reduced by at least another million by June 30, 1947. The total number of Federal civilian employees in the continental United States has been reduced from a peak of 3 million to 2.3 million. I expect a further substantial reduction during the fiscal year 1947 despite the important increases required by the program of veterans' services and surplus disposal activities.
This contraction in wartime budgets has been achieved through the concerted and joint effort of the Congress and the Executive agencies.
The budget recommendations which I have transmitted during this session have been based on severe scrutiny of 34.2 billion dollars of agency requests, which I reduced by 22 percent to 26.5 billion dollars. The Congress reduced them further in appropriating 24.9 billion dollars. (These figures exclude 7.8 billion dollars of indefinite appropriations for interest on the public debt, refunds, and various smaller items.)
Furthermore, the Congress has, upon my recommendation, rescinded during the last year 58 billion dollars of wartime appropriations and authorizations. In addition to the formal rescissions, we have, through budgetary processes, succeeded in securing the transfer of more than 2 billion dollars from special accounts to the Treasury surplus fund and miscellaneous receipts. These amounts otherwise would have been available for expenditure.
Many of us are not yet satisfied with the progress made. It must be recognized, however, that not only war but the aftermath of war and the transition to peace are very expensive.
National security and international commitments compel us to maintain a strong military establishment. Our participation in international organizations, in the occupation of enemy countries, in international finance and relief helps to build the secure peace we all desire. The most destructive war in all history demands a commensurate constructive effort to achieve real peace. The domestic aftermath of the war, which includes care of war veterans, interest payments on the huge war debt, and many other such activities, requires tremendous sums.
Expenditures for national defense, interest on the public debt, tax refunds, veterans, and international finance and relief, account for 86 percent of the budget total. The size of these programs makes it vital to exercise the utmost economy. During the years of fighting, financial considerations had to be subordinated to victory with the least sacrifice of lives. This urgency is no longer present. Today Government expenditures can and must be scrutinized minutely to obtain the maximum economy. The present inflationary situation makes it imperative that expenditures be cut to the minimum compatible with the responsibilities of Government. All deferrable programs must be postponed.
Recent legislation has added considerable amounts to Federal expenditures for the present fiscal year. I shall use all the powers available to the Executive branch for reducing expenditures which are not directly determined by legislation and which can be postponed or reduced without serious harm to national security and welfare.
These measures of budgetary control will, in the aggregate, keep expenditures in the current fiscal year at least 2.2 billion dollars below what they otherwise would have been.
I have directed the Secretaries of War and Navy to curtail military expenditures to the level contemplated in the January Budget, except for terminal leave pay, and certain additional naval programs which the Congress authorized upon my recommendation. My action requires the War and Navy Departments to offset the recent military pay increases by corresponding reductions in other areas. In addition, I have instructed the Secretaries of War and Navy to examine the feasibility of still further reducing the military programs without impairing national security and the ability to fulfill our international commitments.
In view of the rapidly mounting payments for veterans' pensions and benefits, the Administrator of Veterans Affairs has been asked to review and tighten certain standards for such payments in order to protect both the rights of deserving veterans and the national pocketbook.
I am addressing letters to the heads of those agencies which have direct charge of public works, and also to those which have responsibility for grants-in-aid or loans, requesting them to take all measures to secure the postponement of public works at the present time so that the Government competes as little as possible for scarce labor and materials. I have also given instructions to postpone all purchases of automobiles, office equipment, and other items in short supply except in emergency cases.
Furthermore, various agencies will absorb the major part of the recently enacted pay increases.
These measures of budgetary control, achieved by searching and drastic action, reflect the maximum economies I have been able to secure by executive processes at the present time.
In view of action the Congress has taken on price controls, I must repeat--with added emphasis--my recommendation of last January that no tax reduction be made until the inflationary situation has passed.
Budgetary policies have become a major weapon to fight the kind of "boom and bust" which followed World War I.
2. Original and Revised Expenditure Estimates
I am deeply concerned by the increase in the present estimates of expenditures over the tentative estimates which I transmitted in January. Total budget expenditures for the current fiscal year, including net outlays of Government corporations, were then estimated at 36 billion dollars. This estimate was based on then existing legislation and on legislation which I recommended in the same message.
The present estimate of total budget expenditures of 41.5 billion dollars is 5.5 billion dollars higher than the January figure. Programs which have increased are: national defense, refunds, veterans' programs, international finance, housing, and postal service. These combined programs are now estimated to cost 7.5 billion dollars more than six months ago. The increases are attributable to new legislation, deferrals from last year, and the need to expand certain programs more than was expected. On the other hand, expenditures for all other activities of the Federal Government are now expected to decline by 2.0 billion dollars. The difference is a net increase of 5.5 billion dollars, shown in the following tabulation which is derived from Table 1:

Increases in Revised Estimates. Legislation not included in the Budget document but enacted since January or now pending accounts for 4.4 billion dollars of the 7.7.5 billion-dollar increases. This legislation will necessitate the following expenditures in the fiscal year 1947:

Terminal leave pay $2.4

Increased pay for military personnel 0. 6

Increased pensions and liberalized benefits 0. 8

Housing, excluding defense housing, net of

receipts 0. 2

Post Office Department (general fund):

Pay increase0. 2
Total increase resulting from new legislation 4.4
About 1.5 billion dollars of the increases over the January estimate are accounted for by those expenditures originally scheduled for the fiscal year 1946, which were postponed and carried forward into the present fiscal year. This category includes the payment of 950 million dollars on our subscription to the International Monetary Fund. In addition, there are deferred disbursements under the programs of the Export-Import Bank and for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.
Finally, expenditures for certain programs included in the January Budget document are expected to exceed the original estimates by 1.6 billion dollars.
About 350 million dollars of this 1.6-billion-dollar increase arises because Government corporation receipts from the sales of industrial raw materials and surplus plant and equipment are now estimated below those shown in the original Budget. These receipts are treated as deductions from gross expenditures for national defense. A further reduction in receipts from the sale of surplus property by agencies other than Government corporations is reflected in the estimates of miscellaneous receipts of the general and special accounts, rather than as an offset to expenditures. Estimates of tax refunds have been increased by 270 million dollars because of experience with the new types of refunds.
Many more veterans are availing themselves of educational opportunities and other benefits than was estimated in January. These veterans' programs alone account for 1.0 billion dollars of the increase in authorized programs, and some of these programs are still expanding. I believe that tightening of standards for veterans' programs, especially for readjustment allowances and on-the-job training, can bring considerable economies.
Decreases in Revised Estimates. The increase in certain categories of expenditures for the fiscal year 1947 is offset, to some extent, by declines from the January estimates for other categories. These reductions, amounting to 2.0 billion dollars, occur in programs for agriculture, social security, general public works, and general government. A part of these reductions is to be attributed to delays in enactment of proposed legislation and to congressional action reducing appropriations below my recommendations. For example, the total of appropriations for civil departments and agencies is 104 million dollars below the recommendations-over one-half of the decrease in estimated expenditures for this item.
The decrease of 737 million dollars in estimated expenditures for agricultural programs reflects primarily the fact that little, if any, outlay for price supports will be required in the current fiscal year in view of the present outlook for agricultural prices. Expenditures for food subsidies, also included in this category, are now estimated at 975 million dollars, including 175 million dollars to liquidate 1946 obligations. The remaining 800 million dollars, I believe, will be needed during 1947 as a part of the food price control program. The favorable employment outlook also has permitted a considerable reduction in the estimates for social security expenditures.
Federal expenditures for public works are now expected to be less than 60 percent of the original estimates for the fiscal year 1947. Some of these programs were lagging because of material and manpower shortages, and public works of certain types were curtailed by executive as well as congressional action when the Veterans' Emergency Housing Program was initiated. In view of the present inflationary situation, however, this policy of deferment must be extended to all categories and must be enforced as drastically as possible.
I am directing the heads of Federal agencies to curtail public works expenditures in general, and to limit expenditures for certain programs to specified amounts. Consistent with this action, I am asking agencies making grants or loans for construction work to seek cooperation of State and local groups in holding down such expenditures wherever possible. The Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion is issuing an order providing for a 60-day moratorium on all new Federal public works commitments. This directive will also require deferment of a large volume of Federal construction until the last quarter of the fiscal year 1947. Where there is legislation for new programs, expenditures in the fiscal year 1947 will be restricted to planning activities. All in all, the reduction in Federal expenditures for public works is estimated at 707 million dollars. The policy of deferment will also hold down commitments for public works in the years immediately following.
Recent trends have indicated that military and naval expenditures in the current fiscal year were likely to run considerably above the level estimated in the January Budget. This was true even excluding new legislation, such as the military pay increase and larger naval appropriations recommended and enacted since January. The Secretaries of War and Navy, at my request, will reduce projected expenditures for the Army and Navy by 1,650 million dollars to the level shown in the revised estimates of this Review. I believe that this adjustment can be accomplished without impairing the effectiveness of our military establishment. Similarly, I have requested the Chairman of the Maritime Commission to adjust the current program for new ship construction so that expenditures for this purpose will not exceed 60 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947. This action will reduce projected Maritime expenditures by 60 million dollars. These reductions do not directly appear in the tabular comparison of the original and revised estimates. These cuts prevent a corresponding increase that otherwise would have occurred.
I cannot at this time estimate what additional reductions will be feasible under the reexamination of the defense program which, as I have stated above, the Secretaries of War and Navy will undertake. For the military activities of the War and Navy Departments the balances of prior year appropriations available for expenditure, together with new appropriations for the fiscal year 1947, amount to over 22.9 billion dollars. The expenditure program for these activities in the fiscal year 1947 is 13.2 billion dollars. One-third or more of the military expenditures in the fiscal year 1947 will be made from unexpended balances of war year appropriations. After allowing an operating margin this should still leave considerable amounts of carried-over funds to be repealed or to lapse. I believe it quite likely that the reexamination of our defense program will reveal the necessity for further downward adjustments in appropriations.
3. Revised Revenue Estimates and Tax Policy
In January net receipts were estimated at 31.5 billion dollars for the fiscal year 1947. The revised estimate is 39.6 billion dollars as shown in Table 1. The upward revision by 8.1 billion dollars has been made in the expectation that the high dollar volume of economic activity will continue, with a high level of taxable individual and corporate incomes and large sales of taxable commodities.
In making the revenue estimates, it has been assumed that taxes will be maintained at their present level. It has also been assumed that the collections under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act will be continued at a 2 percent total rate through the fiscal year.
The tax reductions and adjustments made last year fully met the needs for adapting the wartime revenue system to the reconversion period. I repeat, no further tax reductions should be made until the present inflationary situation has passed. Our tax policy should be designed not only to check inflation but to prevent any particular group from profiting by it.
4. The Deficit and the National Debt
Between the January and August estimates, receipts have gone up more than expenditures by about 2.6 billion dollars. Hence, the expected deficit for the fiscal year 1947 dropped from 4.5 to 1.9 billion dollars. Without the expenditures under new legislation legislation not contemplated last January-the Budget for the fiscal year 1947 would have shown a surplus.
I shall endeavor throughout the fiscal year to reduce expenditures whenever and wherever they can be reduced without harm to our security and the general welfare. A substantial budget surplus must be our objective for the following year. The Bureau of the Budget, at my direction, has informed all Federal agencies of this goal.
The retirement of the public debt is proceeding more rapidly than previously expected. In the January Budget the Federal debt was estimated at 271 billion dollars on June 30, 1947. By the end of the fiscal year 1947 it will decline to an estimated 261 billion dollars on the basis of present estimates. Liquidation of the Treasury cash balance was somewhat less than expected in the fiscal year 1946, and this will permit correspondingly more debt retirement during the current fiscal year.
5. Payments to and Receipts from the Public
The immediate economic impact of the Budget is felt when the Federal Government either collects money from individuals and business or disburses money to individuals and business. The Budget in its traditional form does not give an adequate picture of these cash transactions between the Government as a unit and the public.
Budget expenditures include certain intragovernmental transactions, such as transfers to trust accounts. They also include, for the fiscal year 1947, substantial amounts of noncash expenditures, such as 950 million dollars in notes to be issued to the International Monetary Fund, and 2.1 billion dollars in terminal leave bonds. On the other hand, budget expenditures do not include certain cash disbursements to the public, such as payments of old-age benefits from trust accounts.
To show actual payments to and receipts from the public, the transactions of the general and special accounts, of Government corporations and of trust accounts must be consolidated, and noncash transactions must be excluded. The following table summarizes such a consolidation:

The table indicates that under the revised estimates the Government will receive more this year in the form of taxes, contributions and other receipts than it will pay to the public. This excess of receipts will help to mitigate inflationary trends.
6. The Government's Budget and the Nation's Budget
The Federal Budget has become of such vital importance that it must be viewed in its relationship with the economy as a whole.
As in former years, I present in Table 5 the most recent estimates for the Government's Budget and the Nation's Budget, with data for a war year, fiscal 1945, for comparison.
The comparison shows that consumer incomes in the last half of the fiscal year 1946 were at a relatively high level, in fact, not much below that of wartime. These consumer receipts include a considerable amount of income payments not received from our current production, such as mustering-out pay and veterans' benefits. Consumers, who accumulated large reserves during wartime, are increasing their purchases, partly financed by installment credit. The current rate of net savings by consumers is greatly below the wartime rate.
During the war business accumulated more funds through depreciation reserves and undistributed profits than it spent for capital outlays. This trend has been fully reversed. Capital formation, chiefly for expanding productive capacity, inventories and exports, now exceeds the internal fund accumulation of business, and thus requires spending of accumulated funds or new financing. Increased spending by consumers, expanded outlays by business, and a still high level of expenditures by Government are causing demand to outrun production. This characterizes the current inflationary threat.
This situation requires that the Federal Government, as well as State and local governments, reduce expenditures and keep taxes at a high level. All deferrable expenditures, at all levels of government, should be postponed until the backlog of demand for goods and services is satisfied.
I said in my January message: "Today inflation is our greatest immediate domestic problem." This is as true now as it was six months ago. The traditional forces of private enterprise and self-reliance are at work in transforming a war economy into a peace economy of high production and full employment. It is our duty to prevent this transformation from degenerating into a speculative boom and subsequent collapse such as we had after the last war. Budgetary policy has a great responsibility in that respect. Its responsibility increases as direct controls are lifted.
