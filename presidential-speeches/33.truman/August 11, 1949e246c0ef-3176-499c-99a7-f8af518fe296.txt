Letter to General Eisenhower Thanking Him for His Services as Presiding Officer of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
My dear General Eisenhower:
When I asked you, last February, to serve temporarily as presiding officer of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, you responded like the good soldier you are. I know how greatly this assignment disrupted your plans, and I want you to know how much I appreciate all that you have done, as well as all that you will do in the future as a consultant and adviser.
The Chiefs have made outstanding progress since you became their presiding officer. This progress has come about because of two principal factors: the great effort you have put into the job, and the high regard for your objectivity and impartiality which all of the Chiefs have--a regard which all of them have mentioned to me on a number of occasions.
The nation is extremely fortunate to have had the benefit of this most recent service by you. As President of the United States and as Commander-in-Chief, I want to thank you for a difficult job well done.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, President, Columbia University, New York, N.Y.]
Note: Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower served as presiding officer of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from February 11, 1949, through August 11, 1949.
