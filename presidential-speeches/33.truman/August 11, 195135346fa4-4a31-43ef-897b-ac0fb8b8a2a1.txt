Statement by the President on the Death of Stephen T. Early.
STEPHEN EARLY gave the best years of his life to the public service. He had been an outstanding newspaperman in Washington before he came upon the White House scene in 1933 with the advent of my predecessor, whom he served faithfully and well through all the changes and vicissitudes of the next 12 years.
Through that long and eventful period, whether the crisis was due to domestic depression, national preparedness, or the prosecution of the most devastating war in human annals, he was always at the side of President Roosevelt as secretary, friend, and sagacious adviser.
When the responsibilities of the Presidency suddenly and without warning came to me with awesome impact, Steve Early, from an impulse of selfless patriotism, consented to stand by as confidant and counselor. Because of all that he did to lighten the burden of the Executive during those momentous days I shall hold his memory in lasting gratitude and appreciation.
Not less valued was his tenure as Deputy Secretary of Defense in an interlude of public service after he had once returned to private business.
Honest, honorable, forthright--irascible sometimes but never vindictive and always just--he had vision as well as courage and a rare faculty of seeing all things in due proportion and through to their logical sequence.
In his untimely passing we mourn a true patriot who no matter what the odds always hewed straight to the line and followed the course where duty lay.
