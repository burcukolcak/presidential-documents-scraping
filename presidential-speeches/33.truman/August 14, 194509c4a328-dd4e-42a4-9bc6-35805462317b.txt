Harry S. Truman
August 14, 1945

Statement by the President Commending Federal Employees.
ONE OF THE hardest working groups of war workers during the past four years--and perhaps the least appreciated by the public--has been the Federal employes in Washington and throughout the country. They have carried on the day-to-day operations of the government which are essential to the support of our fighting men and to the carrying on of the war.
On behalf of the nation, I formally express thanks to them.
As a token of this feeling, I hereby request all the heads of the departments, agencies and bureaus throughout the government to excuse the employes thereof for tomorrow and Thursday.
This action is to be without charge against the annual leave of the employes. Only skeleton forces need be maintained.
I hope that all of the employes of the government will enjoy this well-deserved--though inadequate--holiday.
Note: The President also recognized the contribution of war workers in private industry through a White House release announcing that he had amended Executive Order 9240 to declare August 15 and 16 legal holidays for premium pay purposes. See also Item 115.
