Statement by the President Upon Approving Bill To Expand Basic Research in Agricultural Problems.
AGRICULTURAL MARKETING is the means by which we get food and fiber from our farms to consumers. Anything that increases efficiency in moving farm products to consumers is a material contribution to the nation's welfare. I note that this legislation has the support of producers, distributors, and consumers, and was passed by both Houses of Congress without a dissenting vote.
I consider it a major step for the improvement of the private agricultural marketing system of our country. In addition to work by the United States Department of Agriculture, grants to States are provided as well as authority for entering into contracts with other public and private agencies to accomplish the purposes of this Act. It provides for research on all types of agricultural problems, particularly on utilization of farm products, and the improvement of marketing services.
It is to research that we must attribute much of our progress on the food front as well as on the battle front during the war. Now, as we move into a new period of peace, basic research and the application of the results become even more important. Our greatest peacetime agricultural problem is the efficient marketing of adequate quantities of the right kinds of foods and other farm products. The basic research provided for in this Bill will help solve the problem, and will be of great value to future generations.
Note: As enacted, the bill (H.R. 6932) "To provide for further research into basic laws and principles relating to agriculture and to improve and facilitate the marketing and distribution of agricultural products" is Public Law 733, 79th Congress (60 Stat. 1082).
