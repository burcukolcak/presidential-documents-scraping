Message to President Syngman Rhee on the Second Anniversary of the Republic of Korea.
ON THIS second anniversary of the proclamation of the Republic of Korea, which finds the United States and other members of the United Nations aiding your people in the common purpose of repelling a savage and ruthless Communist invader, I convey to Your Excellency and to the people of Korea the good wishes of the people of the United States. The American people have watched with great satisfaction the impressive achievements of the Republic of Korea since its founding 2 years ago. I know that the aggressor will be repelled and that the people of Korea will achieve the freedom and independence which are their natural right. By a stanch adherence to the principles of right and democracy, victory is assured.
