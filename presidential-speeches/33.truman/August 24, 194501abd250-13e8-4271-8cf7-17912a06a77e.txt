CITATION FOR THE LEGION OF
MERIT DEGREE OF COMMANDER
GEORGES BIDAULT, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Provisional Government of the French Republic, was called to the colors in the autumn of 1939 and devotedly served his country as a sergeant of infantry until the spring of 1940 when he was taken prisoner by the Germans. In July 1941, after more than a year of captivity, he regained his freedom, whereupon without regard for his own safety or well-being he immediately became extremely active in French underground affairs. Displaying at all times zealous determination to drive the invader from France, he played a major part in organizing the French Resistance Movement for effective cooperation with the Allied armies, and became President of the National Council of Resistance, which post he occupied on the Day of Liberation. Continuing as Minister of Foreign Affairs to cooperate with the United Nations in the pursuit of their ideals, M. Bidault fostered a spirit of friendship and harmony between his republic and that of the United States.
