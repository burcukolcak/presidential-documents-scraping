Memorandum Concerning Veteran Preference in Federal Agencies.
[Released August 24, 1945. Dated August 23, 1945]
To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
Section 14 of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 sets forth certain definite procedures to be followed by the heads of departments and agencies in connection with the proposed discharge, suspension for more than thirty days, furlough without pay, or reduction in rank or compensation of an employee of the Federal Government who is entitled to veteran preference.
This Section likewise grants to the veteran, or his designated representative, the right of an appeal to the Civil Service Commission. The law also provides that the Commission shall conduct an investigation, consider the evidence submitted, and then submit its findings and recommendations to the proper administrative officer.
It is my desire that the heads of all departments and agencies arrange to put into effect as promptly as possible the recommendations which the Civil Service Commission makes under Section 14 of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944. This constitutes another way in which the Federal Government can demonstrate that it intends to live up to both the letter and the spirit of the Veterans' Preference Act.
