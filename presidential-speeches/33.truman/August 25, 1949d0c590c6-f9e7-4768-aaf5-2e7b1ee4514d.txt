Proclamation 2852â€”Further Postponing the Effective Date of Proclamation No. 2775 of March 26, 1948, Prescribing Changes in Panama Canal Toll Rates

Whereassection 411 of title 2 of the Canal Zone Code, approved June 19, 1934, authorizes the President to prescribe and from time to time change the tolls that shall be levied by the Government of the United States for the use of the Panama Canal, and provides that no tolls when so prescribed shall be changed unless six months' notice thereof is given by the President by proclamation; and
Whereasincreased tolls for the use of the Panama Canal were prescribed by Proclamation No. 2775 of March 26, 1948, the said proclamation to become effective on October 1, 1948; and
Whereasthe effective date of the said Proclamation No. 2775 was thereafter postponed until September 1, 1949; and

In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Doneat the City of Washington this 25th day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth.
