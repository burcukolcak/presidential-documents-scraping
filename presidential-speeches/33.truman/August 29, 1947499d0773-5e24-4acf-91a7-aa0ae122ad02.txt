Letter to Secretary Krug on the Forthcoming International Conference on Natural Resources.
[Released August 29, 1947. Dated August 27, 1947]
My dear Mr. Secretary:
The Economic and Social Council of the United Nations is undertaking to set up a preparatory commission to plan the International Scientific Conference on the Conservation and Utilization of Natural Resources. As this conference will be held in the United States and because it was initiated at my suggestion, I am especially eager to give the fullest possible cooperation to its planning and preparation.
The subject matter of this conference falls largely in the area of the work of the Department of the Interior. I, therefore, ask that you undertake to set up and give direction to a technical committee to assist representatives of the United Nations' preparatory commission in this work. The scope of the conference will, of course, include the interests of other Departments of the Government, especially State, Agriculture and Commerce, so that representatives of these Departments and other interested agencies should be included on your technical committee. I believe that you will need a full-time assistant to work with this group and to provide a liaison with the preparatory commission.
American participation in this conference should be based upon the broadest possible representation of scientific, educational, industrial and labor groups, as well as governmental agencies. I, therefore, ask that you also set up an advisory committee of members of these interested groups to assist the technical committee in the task of assuring the success of this important undertaking.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Honorable The Secretary of the Interior]
