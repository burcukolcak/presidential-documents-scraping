Message to General MacArthur Regarding the Withdrawal of the General's Message to the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
I AM sending you for your information the text of a letter which I sent to Ambassador Austin dated August 27. I am sure that when you examine this letter, and the letter which Ambassador Austin addressed to Trygve Lie on August 25 (a copy of which I am told was sent your headquarters that night), you will understand why my action of the 26th in directing the withdrawal of your message to the Veterans of Foreign Wars was necessary.
General Collins and Admiral Sherman have given me a comprehensive report of their conversations with you and of their visit to the United Nations forces now fighting under your command in Korea. Their reports were most satisfactory and highly gratifying to me.
Note: General MacArthur's message, in the form of a letter to Clyde A. Lewis, commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, was to have been read at the national encampment of the VFW in Chicago. It is printed in the Congressional Record (vol. 96, pp. 13575 and 13657)
For the President's letter to Ambassador Austin which includes a summary of Mr. Austin's letter to. Trygve Lie, see Item 223.
