Executive Order 10390â€”Amending Executive Order No. 10161 of September 9, 1950, as Amended, to Provide for Certain Alternate Members of the Wage Stabilization Board
By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2061 et seq.), and as President of the United States, it is ordered that section 403 of Executive Order No. 10161 of September 9, 1950, (15 F.R. 6105), as amended, be, and it is hereby, further amended by redesignating paragraph (b) thereof as paragraph (c) and by inserting immediately after paragraph (a) thereof the following new paragraph:
"(b) In addition to the members of the Wage Stabilization Board provided for in section 403 (a) of this order, the Board shall have not more than two alternate members who shall be representative of business and industry. Alternate members shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, at such times as he may deem necessary. Any alternate member shall participate as a member of the Board only in lieu of a member appointed under section 403 (a) of this order who is not participating, and only when called upon by the Chairman of the Wage Stabilization Board to so participate, and when so participating each alternate member shall have the same status and functions as a member appointed under the said section 403 (a). The designation of the Chairman of the Board of alternate members to participate as members of the Board shall be so ordered as to preserve the equal representation required by the provisions of section 403 (a) hereof and of section 403 (b) of the Defense production Act of 1950, as amended."
