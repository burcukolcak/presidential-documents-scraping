Remarks at the Presentation of a Floral Replica of a Defense Bond.
THANK YOU, Mr. Secretary. I am sure that this bond drive will be as successful as all the others have been, for the simple reason that it is right, that it is the safest investment in the world, that it is something that gives people with surplus funds a place to save them. Then, when the time comes that they need things in an emergency, they have got it. And they know it is just the same as money. In fact, better than money, because it is drawing interest.
I want to thank these gentlemen who are responsible for this beautiful floral piece. I hope they will take it and multiply it by a thousand times and put it into bonds.
Note: The President spoke at 3 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. In his opening words he referred to John W. Snyder, Secretary of the Treasury.
The floral display was presented to the President by representatives of the Florists Telegraph Delivery Association. The Association was holding its annual convention in Washington.
