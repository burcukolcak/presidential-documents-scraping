Letter to Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., Concerning Cooperation by the Broadcasting Industry in the Highway Safety Program.
[ Released December 3, 1948. Dated December 2, 1948 ]
Dear Mr. Sloan:
I am delighted to learn of the new radio awards initiated by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to encourage the widest possible cooperation of the broadcasting industry in the nationwide program for highway safety.
The active support of radio and the other public information media has been a vital factor in the success of the Action Program developed by the Highway Safety Conference which I called in 1946. Through intensive application of this safety plan in the states and cities during the past two years, a substantial reduction in the traffic toll has been recorded.
The problem now, in the face of increasing traffic volumes and greater accident exposure, is to maintain and extend our gains. This can be done only by continually stimulating public interest in furthering the Action Program, and a large share of the task necessarily falls to radio.
It is my hope, therefore, that every network and station will participate in the Alfred P. Sloan Awards for Highway Safety, thereby testifying to a truly comprehensive effort on the part of the industry in this important field of public service.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
