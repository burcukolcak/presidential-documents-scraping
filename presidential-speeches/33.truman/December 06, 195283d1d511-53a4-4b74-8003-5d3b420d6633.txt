Statement by the President on German Steps Toward Acceptance of the European Defense Community Agreements.
I AM GRATIFIED by the news from Germany of the first parliamentary action with regard to the European Defense Community Treaty and pleased to note that the Bundestag at the same time passed in second reading the Contractual Conventions. I am conscious of the profound significance of this demonstration of the will of the people through their elected representatives. Together, these agreements will in due course enable the Federal Republic to assume an important and honorable role in the family of free nations, will help create a common defense force for the protection of Western Europe and will constitute an additional major step toward European unity, a goal which is ardently desired by Europeans and their friends throughout the democratic world.
It is realized that the vote by the Bundestag does not constitute final action on account of certain other requirements connected with the ratification process in the Federal Republic. It is however our earnest hope that these can be completed as promptly as possible, and that this will soon be followed by ratification by the other states which have signed the conventions. I feel confident that all those concerned with these key steps will act, conscious of the serious political and other consequences to the position of Germany and to the defense of the free world if ratification is long delayed or not accomplished.
