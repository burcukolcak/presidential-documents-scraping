Statement by the President in Response to Report "Issues Involved in a Unified and Coordinated Federal Program for Transportation."
ON August 30, 1949, I requested the Secretary of Commerce to prepare for my consideration a report outlining the major policy issues which need to be resolved in order to assure maximum effectiveness and consistency of Federal programs in the field of transportation. The Secretary has recently transmitted his report in response to my request.
The issues raised in this report deserve careful consideration within the Government and by the general public. The adequacy and efficiency of our transportation services have a direct impact upon the well-being of our peacetime economy, and upon our defense preparedness. It is essential that Federal programs, covering a wide range of regulatory and promotional activities, make the maximum possible contribution to a healthy and balanced transportation system.
I am requesting all Federal agencies which have responsibility for transportation matters to give me their views on the policy questions raised in this report. With the cooperation of such agencies, immediate and continuing attention will be given to the exploration of these important problems.
Note: The report "Issues Involved in a Unified and Coordinated Federal Program for Transportation," is dated December 1, 1949 (Government printing Office, 1949, 44 pp.).
