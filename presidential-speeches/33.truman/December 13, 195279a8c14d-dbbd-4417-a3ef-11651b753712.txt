Letter to the Administrator, Economic Stabilization Agency, on the Wage Stabilization Board.
Dear Mr. Putnam:
I have received your letter of this date containing your recommendations with respect to the administration of the wage stabilization program pending the resumption of normal operations by the Wage Stabilization Board.
The course of action you recommend has my approval.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Roger L. Putnam, Administrator, Economic Stabilization Agency, Washington 25, D.C.]
Note: In his letter Mr. Putnam stated that all of the regular and alternate members representative of industry on the Wage Stabilization Board had resigned from their positions on the Board, and that the daily operations of the Board had been brought to a standstill. Mr. Putnam proposed that the Economic Stabilization Agency exercise its existing authority to act in the absence of a functioning Wage Stabilization Board. The letter concluded: "It is with great reluctance that I find it necessary to suspend the operations of the tripartite Wage Stabilization Board and to proceed to administer the wage stabilization program directly under my authority. With your approval, however, I shall immediately provide for such administration. At the same time, it is my intention and recommendation that the Government continue to make every effort to reestablish the tripartite Wage Stabilization Board with effective participation by representatives of business and industry, as well as of labor and of the public, as the best means of carrying out the wage stabilization program."
