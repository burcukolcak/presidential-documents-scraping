Message to the Secretary of State Designating General Eisenhower as Supreme Allied Commander, Europe.
[Released December 19, 1950. Dated December 18, 1950]
PURSUANT to the request of the North Atlantic Council that I designate a U.S. officer to take the position of Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, I have designated General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower. In taking this action I wish to express both my gratification and agreement with the view of the North Atlantic Council that General Eisenhower's experience and talents make him uniquely qualified to assume the important responsibilities of this position.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: The President's message was in reply to the following telegram from Secretary of State Acheson:
"The North Atlantic Council today completed arrangements for the establishment of an integrated European defense force. This plan provides that the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, be a U.S. officer. The Council has asked me to transmit to you its request that you designate a U.S. officer to take this position. At the time this action was taken the members of the Council expressed their earnest hope that you will find it possible to designate General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower for the position of Supreme Allied Commander, Europe.
