Harry S. Truman
December 23, 1950

Remarks in Grandview, Missouri, at a Meeting of the Order of the Eastern Stat.
Worthy Grand Matron, distinguished guests:
Don't you think it would be rather superfluous for the older brother of the Grand Matron to attempt to make a speech now ?
All I can say is that I am just as happy as I can be to be here. It is not very often that I get to come back home. As I said last night, it is a pleasure. I was a First Patron of this chapter in 1913, and I was hoping that I could, on occasion, come when I was not coming as a special guest on an invitation from the Grand Matron. Maybe that time will come someday. It is not in sight just yet.
I hope that you have a most prosperous year, and that everything goes as well in the future chapters as it did in 1913.
Note: The President spoke at 9:53 p.m. His opening words referred to his sister, Mary Jane Truman, Worthy Grand Matron of the Order of the Eastern Star for the State of Missouri.
