Harry S. Truman
December 31, 1945

Letter to the Chairman, National War Labor Board, on the Establishment of the National Wage Stabilization Board.
Dear Mr. Garrison:
I have your letter of December 27, 1945, pursuant to which, and in accordance with my letter to you of November 6, 1945, I am issuing an Executive Order terminating the existence of the National War Labor Board as of January 1, 1946, and creating a National Wage Stabilization Board to carry on the stabilization functions required under the Stabilization Act of 1942.
I am accepting as of December 31, 1945, the resignations of the members of the National War Labor Board who have heretofore been appointed by the President.
I wish to extend to all members of the National War Labor Board, to the members of its regional agencies and commissions, and to its staff in Washington and in the field, my thanks for the outstanding wartime job they have done in the last four years, under the most difficult circumstances, in helping to maintain industrial peace, maximum production, and wage stabilization. They have earned and thoroughly deserve the gratitude of their fellow citizens.
I deeply appreciate the accomplishments of the Board, as summarized in your letter, and I shall await with interest the submission of your more detailed terminal report.

Very truly yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Lloyd K. Garrison, Chairman, National War Labor Board]
