CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE LEGION OF MERIT DEGREE OF CHIEF COMMANDER TO

ABDUL AZIZ IBN ABDUR RAHMAN AL FAISAL AL SAUD
HIS MAJESTY Abdul Aziz Ibn Abdur Rahman al Faisal Al Saud, King of Saudi Arabia, rendered exceptionally meritorious service to the war effort of the United Nations. He led his country in an unwavering course of support and encouragement to the cause of the Allies, a course which culminated in a declaration of war against the Axis in March 1945. As Commander-in-Chief of Saudi Arabia, he kept the land, sea and air routes under his control open for use, and by his attitude of wholehearted cooperation, he enabled American forces to accomplish a program of construction and resource development in the country that derived benefits of major proportions for the prosecution of the war. Through his unswerving loyalty, and by his dynamic leadership at the head of his nation in the support of the cause, King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud made a notable contribution to the successful war effort of the United Nations.
