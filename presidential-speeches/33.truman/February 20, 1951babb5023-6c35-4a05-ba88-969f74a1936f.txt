Remarks to the Voice of Democracy Contest Winners.
IT IS a pleasure to greet you. It seems that the young ladies win their prizes at an earlier date than the young men--18 against 17, if I am not mistaken.
But you are to be congratulated on what you have done. It is a contribution to the welfare of the country, and highly appreciated by me.
I think this is the fourth time, if I am not mistaken, that you are having a meeting on this very same subject and for this very same reason, and I hope you will continue in your careers and keep on putting out this information for which you won these prizes.
Note: The President spoke at 11:35 a.m. in his office at the White House, where he received the four high school students who had written winning broadcast scripts on the subject "I Speak for Democracy": Robert A. Burnett of St. Louis, Mo., Marcia Anne Harmon of Del Rosa, Calif., Norita Newbrough of Baton Rouge, La., and Ricardo Romulo of Washington, D.C., son of Gen. Carlos P. Romulo, Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Philippine Republic.
The contest was sponsored by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Broadcasters, and the Radio-Television Manufacturers Association.
