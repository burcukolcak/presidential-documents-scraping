Remarks to the Winners of the Fifth Annual Voice of Democracy Contest.
WELL, I congratulate you again. You are really making a contribution to the cause of democracy, because you not only educate yourselves but you educate some other people when you are doing this, and that is the most important thing in the world.
I hope that this function will be continued indefinitely. I think this is my 5th or 6th year congratulating the winners, and it always gives me a lot of pleasure, as I told them time and again.
And I think that with peace in the world, which we will eventually get, the greatest age in history is ahead of us. I would give anything in the world if I were 18 instead of 68, so that I could see it.
It is up to you now to make it work, and I am sure you will when the time comes.

Again, I congratulate you.
Note: The President spoke at 12:45 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House to the four winners of a high school essay competition on the subject: "I speak for Democracy." The students were Dwight Clark, Jr., of Fort Collins, Colo., George A. Frilot III of New Orleans, La., Mara Gay Masselink of Burlington, Iowa, and Thaddeus S. Zolkiewicz of Buffalo, N.Y.
The contest was sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Broadcasters, and the Radio-Television Manufacturers Association. The schools participating represented over 1,500 communities in all 48 States, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico,
