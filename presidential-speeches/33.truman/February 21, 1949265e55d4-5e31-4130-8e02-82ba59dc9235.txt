Executive Order 10040â€”Amendment of Executive Order No. 9999, Suspending Certain Statutory Provisions Relating to Employment in the Canal Zone
By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Civil Functions Appropriation Act, 1949 (Public Law 782, 80th Congress), section 103 of the Department of the Navy Appropriation Act, 1949 (Public Law 753, 80th Congress), and section 4 of the Military Functions Appropriation Act, 1949 (Public Law 766 80th Congress), relating to certain kinds of employment in the Canal Zone, and deeming such course to be in the public interest, it is ordered as follows:
The first paragraph of Executive Order No. 9999 of September 14, 1948, which suspends compliance with certain statutory provisions relating to certain kinds of employment in the Canal Zone during the continuance of the present national emergency, is hereby amended, as of September 14, 1948, by changing the period at the end thereof to a colon and adding thereto the following proviso:
"Provided, that this suspension shall not be construed to affect the provisions of the said sections relating to the amount of compensation that may be received by persons employed in skilled, technical, clerical, administrative, executive, or supervisory positions on the Canal Zone directly or indirectly by any branch of the United Stares Government or by any corporation or company whose stock is owned wholly or in part by the Untied Stares Government."
