Remarks to a Delegation from the United Jewish Appeal.
IN THE TRIAL of war criminals at Nureraberg the fact has been established that 5,700,000 Jews perished under the murderous reign of Hitlerism. That crime will be answered in justice.
There are left in Europe 1,500,000 Jews, men, women and children, whom the ordeal has. left homeless, hungry, sick, and without assistance. These, too, are victims of the crime for which retribution will be visited upon the guilty. But neither the dictates of justice nor that love of our fellowman which we are bidden to practice will be satisfied until the needs of these sufferers are met.
Note: The President spoke in his office at the White House in connection with the opening of the United Jewish Appeal campaign.
