Remarks to Representatives of the American Council of Voluntary Agencies for Foreign Service.
THE AMERICAN people during and following World War I developed a tradition of help to the war afflicted through public and private support. Throughout World War II, and now in this trying postwar period, we are maintaining this tradition of humanitarianism.
A large need continues for public and private help. Congress has before it my recommendations for direct help, and I have asked also that we share the responsibility with other countries of the United Nations in meeting the needs of refugees.
While the provisioning of whole populations and the settlement of refugees is primarily a public task, voluntary help should continue as in the past. This form of help is essential to complement the public programs, whether carried out by our Government on its own responsibility or through the United Nations.
