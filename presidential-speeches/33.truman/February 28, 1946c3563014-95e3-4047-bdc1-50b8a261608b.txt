Statement by the President Recommending a Nationwide Voluntary "Share-the-Housing" Program.
THE HOUSING SHORTAGE has become a serious problem throughout the Nation. Thousands of our veterans are finding it impossible to obtain adequate housing for themselves and their families.
In spite of our best efforts to facilitate new construction, the shortage will probably remain acute for some months.
Recognizing that during the war, the churches and synagogues of the Nation have ministered to service men and women in many important ways, and believing that the personal concern of churchmen would aid materially in meeting our urgent housing needs, J recently discussed this matter with representatives of the Catholic, Protestant and Jewish faiths and suggested a nationwide "Share the Housing" effort. The religious leaders have responded with the following definite suggestions, which I indorse most heartily:
1. The organization of a housing committee in every church or synagogue.
2. A thorough canvass of the membership of every church or synagogue to discover available housing facilities.
3. A check-up on veterans in need of housing, using church Honor Rolls as the starting point.
4. Community-wide cooperation in this effort among all religious and civic groups. Surely no veteran who has served his country faithfully and well should now be left homeless on his return from service. I sincerely hope that every citizen will take this matter to heart and aid this effort in every way possible.
Religion teaches us that we should share. By sharing our housing we can render a practical and personal service to our veterans.
