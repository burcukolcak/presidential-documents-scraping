Statement by the President on the 39th Anniversary of the Founding of the Girl Scouts.
DURING the years since 1912, when girl scouting was founded, your organization's program of service to home, community, and country has become an integral part of the lives of millions of young people. On March 12, when you celebrate your 39th anniversary, every member can be proud of being part of a movement that is a growing force for freedom and for good citizenship in our Nation. I extend my warmest greetings to all Girl Scouts on this occasion.
There are today more than a million and a half girls in the United States taking part in the Girl Scout program and pledged to do their duty to God and country. In your troops you are learning skills that will enable you to take care of yourselves and to be of service to others; you are building strong bonds of friendship with children of other lands; you are learning how to work together for the good of all. The promptness with which you and your leaders have volunteered for civil defense is evidence of your willingness to serve community and country. Our Nation's civil defense program needs the support of everyone. It is gratifying to know that you are prepared to serve in time of emergency.
The gratitude of every citizen is due to the thousands of adult volunteer workers who make the Girl Scout program possible. I send them my best wishes for continued success and progress.
