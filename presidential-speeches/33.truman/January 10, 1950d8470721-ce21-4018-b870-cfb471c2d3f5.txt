Letter to the U.S. Representative on the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women.
My dear Judge Kenyon:
I want to express my appreciation of your service as United States Representative on the Commission on the Status of Women of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations during the past three years. I have been especially interested in the work of this Commission, for it is my belief, as I know it is yours, that the sound conduct of public business requires the full participation of all citizens, men and women alike. The Commission has benefited by your practical experience as a member of the Bar, especially in these first years of organization and planning. Your earlier service as an expert member of the League of Nations' Committee on the Legal Status of Women and in regard to the nationality problems of married women have also been an asset in selecting fields for action and evaluating results.
I am well aware that you have carried the work of this Commission at a great sacrifice to your heavy law practice. I know, too, that you have given generously of your time to counsel with other members of the Commission and with the staff of the United Nations concerned with the Commission's objectives, as well as to interpret its progress to organizations and individuals throughout the United States. I hope that even though your term of office has expired, we may call on you from time to time for consultation on the numerous technical problems which arise in working to achieve equality for women in all countries.
Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN.
[Honorable Dorothy Kenyon, 50 Broadway, New York 4, N.Y.]
