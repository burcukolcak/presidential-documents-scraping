MAJOR GENERAL William J. Donovan served in the highly important and responsible position of Director of Strategic Services, Joint Chiefs of Staff, from June 1942 to August 1945. With ability, judgment and foresight he anticipated the need for secret intelligence, research and analysis, and the conduct of unorthodox methods of warfare in support of military operations. He extended his organization to operate in overseas theaters and neutral areas, and through his many diversified activities gave valuable service in the field of intelligence and special operations to theater commanders, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the State Department and other government agencies. Through his successful achievements, General Donovan contributed in a high degree to the success of military operations in the prosecution of the war.
