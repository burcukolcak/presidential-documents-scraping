Letter to the Speaker of the House Transmitting Proposed Reductions in Appropriations.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives:
SIR: Pursuant to the provisions of the Second Deficiency Appropriation Act, 1945, and the Military Appropriation Act, 1946, I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress proposed rescissions and provisions as set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget in whose comments and observations thereon I concur.
These recommendations are the result of the continuous review of the war and war-related appropriations and authorizations which I indicated in my previous recommendations would be made. There is need for further efforts in this direction and I have directed that the review be continued.
The amounts here recommended for rescission, together with those set forth in the enrolled bill, H.R. 4407, are being placed in a nonexpendable status, pending the enactment of legislation.

Respectfully yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: A White House release of January 14, describing the proposal, stated that the President had recommended repeal of appropriations aggregating $5,751,428,483 and of contract authorizations of $420,079,000 and that he had proposed a return to the Treasury of $346,890 in corporate funds. The release also stated that these amounts were in addition to the net rescissions of $50.3 billion approved by the Congress at the close of its last session. The release added that the appropriations now recommended for rescission included $1,503,971,475 for the civil agencies of the Government, $1,420,576,472 for the Military Establishment, and $2,826,880,536 for the Naval Establishment.
The details of the proposal as set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, transmitted with the President's letter, are printed in House Document 394 (79th Cong., 2d sess.).
