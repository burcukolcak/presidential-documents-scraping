Letter Accepting Resignation of Charles F. Brannan as Secretary of Agriculture.
[Released January 16, 1953. Dated January 13, 1953]
Dear Charlie:
I have received your letter of January eighth and, in accordance with your wish, I am accepting your resignation effective at the close of my term of office. I want to tell you what a genuine pleasure it has been to have you in my Cabinet during the past four and a half years. Our working relationships have always been cordial and I have leaned heavily on your wise counsel on many matters of public concern.
The remarkable progress of American agriculture during your tenure, together with recommendations you have made which are yet to be recognized and put into effect, will assure you of proper recognition by future historians.
Not the least of my satisfactions has been your appointment as Secretary of Agriculture after many years of meritorious service with the Department. As you close seventeen years of diligent effort on behalf of the farmers of America, I offer you my thanks for what you have done for them and for me.
For the future, I wish every good thing for you. I know you will always be in the forefront of those who are working for the welfare of people in every walk of life.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: Mr. Brannan served as Secretary of Agriculture from June 2, 1948, to January 20, 1953. His letter of resignation, dated January 8, was released with the President's reply.
