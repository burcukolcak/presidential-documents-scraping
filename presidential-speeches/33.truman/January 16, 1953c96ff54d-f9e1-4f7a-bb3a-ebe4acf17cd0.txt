SEC. 3. To the extent authorized by the act, the Federal Civil Defense Administrator shall foster the development of such State and local organizations and plans as may be necessary to cope with major disasters.
SEC. 4. Nothing in this order shall be construed to prevent any Federal agency from affording such assistance and taking such other action as may accord with the existing policies, practices, or statutory authority of such agency in the event of any disaster which will not permit delay in the commencement of Federal assistance or other Federal action, and pending the determination of the President whether the disaster is a major disaster: Provided, that such assistance and such other action shall be subject to coordination by the Federal Civil Defense Administration, acting on behalf of the President.
