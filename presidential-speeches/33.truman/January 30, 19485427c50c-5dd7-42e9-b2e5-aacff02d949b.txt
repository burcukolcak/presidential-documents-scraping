Whereas,on January 1, 1948 by Proclamation 2764 the President proclaimed such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America in respect of products of the Republic of Cuba and such continuance of existing customs and excise treatment of products of the Republic of Cuba imported into the United States of America as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out said exclusive trade agreement on and after January 1, 1948 (13 F.R. 21);
Whereas,paragraph 3 of article I of said general agreement provides in part as follows:

(a) in respect of duties or charges on any product described in such Schedule, the difference between the most-favoured-nation and preferential rates provided for therein; if no preferential rate is provided for, the preferential rate shall for the purposes of this paragraph be taken to be that in force on April 10, 1947, and, if no most-favoured-nation rate is provided for, the margin shall not exceed the difference between the most-favoured-nation and preferential rates existing on April 10, 1947;
(b) in respect of duties or charges on any product not described in the appropriate Schedule, the difference between the most-favoured-nation and preferential rates existing on April 10, 1947. (T.D. 51802 (Customs));
Whereas, I, Harry S. Truman,President of the United States of America, determine that the rates of duty and import tax specified in the column at the right of the respective descriptions of products in the following list are maximum rates which may be applied on and after January 1, 1948 to such products in conformity with said paragraphs 3 of article I, and that said maximum-rate limitations are required or appropriate to carry out said trade agreement specified in the 1st recital of this proclamation:
GENERAL NOTES
1. The provisions of this list shall be construed and given the same effect, and the application of collateral provisions of the customs laws of the United States to the provisions of this list shall be determined, insofar as may be practicable, as if each provision of this list appeared respectively in the statutory provision noted in the column at the left of the respective description of articles.
2. Any additional or separate ordinary customs duty provided for in respect of any article described in this list, whether or not imposed under the statutory provision indicated in the column at the left of the description of the article and whether or not temporarily or conditionally inapplicable, shall continue in force until terminated in accordance with law, subject to any reduction, or consolidation with the primary duty, indicated in this list or hereafter provided for, and subject to any temporary or conditional exemption therefrom now or hereafter provided for by law.
3. Wherever in this list the word "entered" is used in any seasonal-rate provision, or in any provision in which the entry of a specified quantity affects the rate, it shall mean "entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption".;
Whereas,I determine that the application of such of the concessions provided for in part I of schedule XX of said general agreement which were withheld from application in accordance with article XXVII of said general agreement (T.D. 51802 (Customs)) by said proclamation of December 16, 1947 (12 F.R. 8865 and 8866) as are identified in the following list is required or appropriate to carry out said trade agreement specified in the 1st recital of this proclamation on and after January 1, 1948:
Whereas,said proclamation of December 16, 1947, made effective, on and after January 1, 1948, the rate of duty of 7 cents per pound specified in the first item 709 in part I of schedule XX of said general agreement with respect to not more than 50,000,000 pounds of butter entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the period from November 1 in any year to the following March 31, inclusive (T.D. 51802 (Customs));
Whereas,said tariff quota provided for in said item 709 became effective on the first day of the third month of the specified five-month quota period, and I determine that it would be appropriate in order to carry out said trade agreement specified in the 1st recital of this proclamation to limit the quantity of butter dutiable at the rate of 7 cents per pound which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the remainder of said quota period from January 1 to March 31, 1948, inclusive, to a quantity of not more than 30,000,000 pounds;
Whereas,I determine that the addition of the following items to the list set forth in the 8th recital of said proclamation of January 1, 1948 (13 F.R. 23 and 24) is required or appropriate to carry out said exclusive trade agreement specified in the 3rd recital of this proclamation:
Whereas,I determine that, in view of the determination set forth in the 8th recital of this proclamation, the deletion of the first item 506 and item 752 from the list set forth in the 9th recital of said proclamation of January 1, 1948 is required or appropriate to carry out said exclusive trade agreement specified in the 3rd recital of this proclamation;
Whereas,the figure and word "4/5 of" appearing between the words "than" and "the" in the rate of duty specified in the second item 506 in the 9th recital of said proclamation of January 1, 1948 (13 F.R. 24) were inadvertently included therein, and I determine that the deletion of said figure and word "4/5 of" from the rate of duty specified in said second item 506 is required or appropriate to carry out said exclusive trade agreement specified in the 3rd recital of this proclamation on and after January 1, 1948.
Whereas,item 1527(9a)(2) in said 9th recital of the proclamation of January 1, 1948 (13 F.R. 25) was inadvertently misstated in some respects, and I determine that it is required or appropriate to carry out said exclusive trade agreement specified in the 3rd recital of this proclamation that the number of said item 1527(a)(2) in the 9th recital be changed to "1527(c)(2)", that there be inserted in the description of products in said item after the word "except" the words and figure "parts of articles valued above $5 per dozen pieces and other", that a final parenthesis be placed after the last word in said description of products, and that the rate in said item be changed to "88% ad val.";
And Whereas,I determine that it is required or appropriate to carry out said trade agreement specified in the 1st recital of this proclamation and said exclusive trade agreement specified in the 3rd recital hereof that no modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions, and no continuance of existing customs or excise treatment, proclaimed to carry out said trade agreement specified in the 1st recital shall be construed as providing for the preferential customs treatment, in respect of rates of ordinary customs duty, of products of the Republic of Cuba, which customs treatment of products of the Republic of Cuba is provided for in said proclamation of January 1, 1948, as amended;
