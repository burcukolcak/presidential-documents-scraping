Statement by the President on the Assassination of Mohandas K. Gandhi.
THIS MORNING when I heard the tragic news of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, I sent a message to Earl Mountbatten, the Governor General of India, expressing my condolences to him and to the people of India. Gandhi was a great Indian nationalist but at the same time he was a leader of international stature. His teachings and his actions have left a deep impression on millions of people. He was and is revered by the people of India, and his influence was felt not only in affairs of government but also in the realm of the spirit. Unhappily, he did not live to witness the full realization of those ideals for which he struggled, but his life and his work will be through the years to come the greatest monument to him. His selfless struggle for the betterment of his people will, I am sure, endure as an example for India's leaders, many of whom are his disciples. I know that not only the people of India but also all peoples will be inspired by his sacrifice to work with increased vigor toward the brotherhood and peace which the Mahatma symbolized.
Note: On the same day the White House released the text of the message from the President to His Excellency Earl Mountbatten of Burma, Governor General of India.
