Letter to Admiral McCormick Designating Him Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic.
My dear Admiral McCormick:
The North Atlantic Treaty Nations have agreed that a Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic, should now be appointed and have requested that I designate a United States officer. I have designated you for this new international command which embraces a large area under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
I am informed that the Standing Group of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will issue a directive to you concerning your responsibilities and authority as the Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic.
You are hereby assigned operational command, of the United States Armed forces assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Command, to the extent necessary for the accomplishment of your mission.
You are hereby authorized to use officers and enlisted personnel of the U.S. Armed forces and civilian employees of the U.S. Government, on your staff as you consider appropriate in numbers and grades as necessary.
I am sending copies of this letter to the Secretary of State and to the Secretary of Defense for their guidance.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Admiral Lynde D. McCormick, United States Navy, Washington, D.C.]
