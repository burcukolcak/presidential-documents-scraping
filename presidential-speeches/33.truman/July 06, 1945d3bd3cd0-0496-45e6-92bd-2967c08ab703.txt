Memorandum to Federal Agencies on the Handling of Government Funds.
To the Heads of all Executive Departments and Agencies:
Throughout the war period I have been concerned with the necessity of extreme care in the handling of government funds, especially when expenditures are at such unprecedented levels and so many officials are charged with disbursement of these funds. I am certain that you share my satisfaction that there has been so little evidence of abuse, and that you also share my strong desire that this good record shall be preserved.
Therefore, I am asking you and the other Department and Agency heads to express and underscore my determination to insure the most exacting review of expenditures in every instance where there is the slightest ground to suspect either misuse or careless handling of government funds. Any such instance should be investigated promptly and, where appropriate, a vigorous disciplinary action should be invoked. I trust that you will transmit this message to your staff and supplement it with appropriate instructions of your own.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: On the following day the President went aboard the U.S.S. Augusta at Newport News, Va., en route to the Postman Conference which opened on July 17. He returned to Washington on August 7.
