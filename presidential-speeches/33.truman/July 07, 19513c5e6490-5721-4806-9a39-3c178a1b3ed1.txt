Remarks to Members of the 25th Infantry Division Association.
IT IS a pleasure to be with you this morning. You can understand exactly what I think of the 25th Division when I made your Commanding General the Chief of Staff of the Army--and he is a good one.
You naturally ought to be exceedingly proud--and I know you are--of the record of your great fighting organization.
Your record in the South Pacific, and the present record in Korea, is beyond compare. And I want to say to you that it gives me pleasure, and I feel highly honored that General Collins would ask me to appear before his organization, just to congratulate you on your career, on your patriotism, and on the good that you have done this great United States of America.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 11:30 a.m. at the Statler Hotel in Washington. In his remarks the President referred to Gen. J. Lawton Collins, Chief of Staff, United States Army.
