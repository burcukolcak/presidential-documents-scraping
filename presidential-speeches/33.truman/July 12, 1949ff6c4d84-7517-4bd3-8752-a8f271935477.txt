Telegram Urging Management and Labor Leaders To Postpone the Steel Strike.
THE DIRECTOR of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service has reported to me on the status of the current dispute between the major companies in the basic steel industry and the United Steel Workers of America, CIO. It appears that the parties are deadlocked and that there is no likelihood of a settlement through negotiations, with the aid of mediation, before July 16, when strike action is contemplated by the union.
The basic steel industry occupies a strategic and vital position in the economy of the Nation. A cessation of work and operations in that industry would have grave consequences, and would interfere with the attainment of our national objectives.
In view of these circumstances, I am requesting the parties to continue work and operations under the terms of the collective bargaining agreements now in effect for a period of sixty days from July 16, 1949. I am appointing a Board consisting of three public members to investigate and to inquire into the issues in dispute and to report to me thereon within forty-five days from July 16, 1949, with their recommendations to the parties as to fair and equitable terms of settlement.
I earnestly request all parties to the dispute to accept this proposal and will appreciate a prompt reply.
