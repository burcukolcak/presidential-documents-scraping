Remarks in Grandview, Mo., After Viewing the Flood Disaster Area.
WE HAVE just made an investigation of the flood situation from St. Louis to Salina, Kans., and from Salina to Miami, Okla. And it is one of the worst disasters, I think, that the country has ever suffered from water. I am informed by General Pick that it is the worst.
I have had the Chief of Engineers, a representative of the Department of Agriculture, a representative of the Federal Housing Administrator, and the Production Director of the war production setup with me today, and they are expecting to work together to see if we can meet this situation as promptly as possible in every manner that is necessary to alleviate suffering, and to put the community back on its feet again.
Note: The President spoke at 5:45 p.m. at the airport in Grandview after viewing the disaster area from the air. His remarks were broadcast.
Accompanying the President on the inspection trip were Charles E. Wilson, Director, Office of Defense Mobilization; Maj. Gen. Lewis A. Pick, Chief of Engineers, United States Army; Donald E. Smith, Director of the Kansas City Commodity Stabilization Office, Department of Agriculture; and Chester W. Anderson, Regional Engineer of the Federal Housing Administration.
