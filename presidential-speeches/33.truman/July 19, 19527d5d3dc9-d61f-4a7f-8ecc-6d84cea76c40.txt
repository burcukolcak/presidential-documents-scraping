Memorandum of Disapproval of Bill Authorizing the Postmaster General To Lease Quarters for Post Office Purposes.
I AM withholding my approval of H.R. 6839, "To modify and extend the authority of the Postmaster General to lease quarters for post-office purposes."
Although H.R. 6839 would grant desirable authority to the Postmaster General to enter into lease-purchase agreements for acquiring space to be used for postal purposes, it contains a provision which would infringe upon the functions of the Executive branch to such an extent that I feel I cannot give my approval.
Section 8 of H.R. 6839 requires that every lease-purchase agreement negotiated under authority of this bill receive the approval of the House and Senate Committees on Post Office and Civil Service and the House and Senate Committees on Public Works.

I do not dispute the right of the Congress and its Committees to take an interest in real estate transactions made by the Executive Branch of the Government, but I do question the propriety and wisdom of giving Committees veto power over executive functions authorized by the Congress to be carried out by executive agencies. Full information regarding any property transaction has in the past, and will in the future, be made available to the Committees of Congress.
I hope that the Congress will, at its next session, give further consideration to legislation to accomplish the purposes of H.R. 6839, and that it will frame legislation free from the difficulties which impel me to withhold my approval from this measure.
