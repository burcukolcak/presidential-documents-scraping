Letter to David K. Niles, Administrative Assistant to the President.
[Released July 20, 1945. Dated July 17, 1945]
Dear Dave:
I am glad that at my request you are remaining on in your post as one of the Administrative Assistants to the President. I know that your long record in government will be helpful to me as it was to the late President Roosevelt.
For ten years you have taken an important part in the activities of our government in Washington. Beginning with the work of relieving the distress of unemployment, and later in the Department of Commerce, the Office of Production Management, and for the last several years, as an Administrative Assistant you have had a hand in many of the important events of the last decade. It will be of great service to have the benefit of your ability and conscientious service, and the experience and information you have acquired during these years will be most valuable.
With kindest regards,

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable David K. Niles, Administrative Assistant to the President, The White House]
