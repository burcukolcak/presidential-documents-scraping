Statement by the President on the Death of Mackenzie King.
NEWS of the death of Mr. Mackenzie King, so long the leader in Canadian public life and a commanding figure in world affairs, will bring sorrow to his legion of friends in the United States among whom I was privileged to be numbered. His tenure as Prime Minister of Canada--exceeding 21 years--was not only the longest in the history of the British Commonwealth, it was as distinguished as it was extended. He brought his country to a new stature of greatness. His passing marks the close of an epoch in the life of our neighbor to the north.
In the recurring international conferences growing out of two world wars he exercised an ever increasing influence. In him freedom loving peoples and democratic institutions found an unwavering champion.
Happily relations between his country and our own grew ever closer as our two peoples recognized their mutual interest and made common cause on the side of freedom in the conflict between democracy and dictatorship which rent the world through most of the troubled years of Mr. King's long public service.
