Statement by the President on the Settlement of the Steel Strike.
MR. MURRAY and Mr. Fairless have just advised me that six major steel companies and the United Steel Workers of America (CIO) have reached agreement on important basic issues. The union is calling its National Wage Policy Committee to meet in Washington tomorrow morning for the purpose of ratifying the agreement. This should lead to a speedy resumption of steel production.
