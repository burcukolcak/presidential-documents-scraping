Statement by the President on the Dangers of Explosive-Type War Souvenirs.
IT HAS BEEN brought to my attention that the War, Navy, and Treasury Departments and the National Rifle Association have joined in a campaign of instruction to prevent the loss of life and destruction of property resulting from the possession of explosive-type war souvenirs. One need but scan the papers to see that such a safety program is badly needed.
The problem is primarily one of education. It is regrettable that a step of this kind was not taken after past wars. This neglect has cost us thousands of lives and millions of dollars.
Three Government agencies and a nonprofit sportsmen's organization have banded together in a public service. I trust the public will hear them--and heed.
