Harry S. Truman
July 25, 1949

Statement by the President Upon Ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty.
THE AMERICAN people value peace and freedom above all things. Our ratification of the North Atlantic Pact with the overwhelming support of the Senate and the people shows our determination to preserve this peace and freedom.
This treaty is an historic step toward a world of peace, a free world, free from fear, but it is only one step. We have malice toward none. With our partners in the pact and other like-minded peoples we must, with God's help and guidance, work for peace with every means at our command. We must keep ourselves morally and materially strong. We must play our part in helping to strengthen freedom everywhere. We must work patiently and tirelessly to make the United Nations ever more effective for its great task. We must seek ever greater unity of purpose and of action in the cause of peace.
Note: The North Atlantic Treaty was signed at Washington on April 4, 1949; ratification was advised by the Senate of the United States on July 21, and the Treaty was ratified by the President on July 25. The instrument of ratification of the United States was deposited at Washington on July 25, and the Treaty entered into force on August 24.
