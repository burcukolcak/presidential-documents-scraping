Migratory game birds on which open seasons are specified in regulation 4 may be taken during such seasons only with bow and arrow or with a shotgun not larger than No. 10 gage, fired from the shoulder, except as permitted by regulations 7, 8, and 9, but they shall not be taken with or by means of any automatic-loading or hand-operated repeating shotgun capable of holding more than three shells, the magazine of which has not been cut off or plugged with a one-piece metal or wooden filler incapable of removal through the loading end thereof so as to reduce the capacity of said gun to not more than three shells at one time in the magazine and chamber combined. Such birds may be taken during the open seasons from land or water, with aid of a dog, and from a blind, boat or other floating craft not under tow or sail, except sinkbox (battery), motorboat (excluding a boat having a detached outboard motor), and sailboat; provided, that nothing herein shall permit the taking of migratory game birds from or by means, aid, or use of an automobile or aircraft of any kind, the taking of waterfowl by meals, aid, or use of cattle, horses, mules, or live duck or goose decoys, the concentrating, driving, rallying, or stirring up of waterfowl and coots by means or aid of any motor driven land, water or air conveyance or sailboat; provided further, that nothing herein shall exclude the picking up of injured or dead waterfowl by means of a motorboat, sailboat, or other craft.
Waterfowl (except for propagating, scientific, or other purposes under permit issued pursuant to regulation 8), mourning doves and white-winged doves are not permitted to be taken, directly or indirectly, by means, aid, or use of shelled, shucked, or unshucked corn, or of wheat or other grain, salt, or other feed that has been so deposited, distributed, or scattered as to constitute for such birds a lure, attraction, or enticement to, on, or over the area where hunters are attempting to take them; provided, however, such birds may be taken over properly chocked corn and standing crops of corn, wheat, or other grain or feed, and grains found scattered solely as a result of agricultural harvesting.
A person over 16 years of age is not permitted to take migratory waterfowl unless at the time of such taking he has on his person an unexpired Federal migratory-bird hunting stamp, validated by his signature written across the face thereof in ink.
