An allowance under subsection A1 shall not be payable upon reenlistment within three months from date of last discharge, or upon recall to active duty within three months of last release therefrom, except as specified in subsections 5, 6 and 7 of this section. A man reenlisted or recalled to active duty within three months of last discharge or release from active duty, who on date of such discharge or release was checked undrawn clothing allowance in accordance with subsection 1 of this section, shall be entitled to credit for such undrawn clothing allowance.

5. An enlisted man first reporting for active duty in a status entitling him only to an issue of clothing in kind in accordance with subsection A6 and A9(b) hereof, upon subsequent transfer to, or reenlistment within three months of last discharge in, another status which, in the case of first enlistment or reporting for active duty, would entitle him to a cash clothing allowance as prescribed in subsection A1 hereof, shall be entitled to a credit of such cash clothing allowance without regard to issues in kind in the prior status, except that an enlisted man entitled to a clothing allowance under subsection A9(b) on first reporting for active duty shall not be so entitled.
6. An enlisted man first reporting for active duty in a status entitling him only to an issue of clothing in kind in accordance with subsection A7 hereof, upon subsequent transfer to, or reenlistment within three months of last discharge in, another status which, in the case of a first enlistment or reporting for active duty, would entitle him to a cash clothing allowance as prescribed in subsection A1 hereof, shall be entitled to a credit of such cash clothing allowance without regard to issues in kind in the prior status.
7. Enlisted personnel described in subsection A9(a), upon discharge from the Naval Reserve (inactive) for the purpose of enlisting in the Regular Navy or Coast Guard within three months from date of such discharge, shall, if reenlisted in any of the applicable ratings, be entitled to a further cash allowance equal to the difference between the cash allowance payable under subsection A1(a) hereof, and the amount payable under subsection A9(a), and such enlisted personnel shall, if enlisted in other ratings in the Regular Navy or Coast Guard, within three months from date of such discharge, be entitled to the cash allowances prescribed in subsection A1(b) hereof.
