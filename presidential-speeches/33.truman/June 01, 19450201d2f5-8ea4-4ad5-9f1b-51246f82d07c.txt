Letter to the Chairman, House Civil Service Committee, Concerning Reduction in Hours of Work.
Dear Mr. Congressman:
It is my understanding that your Committee, in connection with the Overtime Pay provisions of H.R. 2497, has expressed an interest in learning about the plans of the executive branch for reductions in hours of work.
Within the near future I intend to advise the heads of the departments and agencies that whenever they have offices which are located in labor market areas classified in Groups II, III, and IV by the War Manpower Commission they may reduce the hours of work from 48 per week.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Honorable Robert Ramspeck, Chairman, Civil Service Committee, House of Representatives ]
