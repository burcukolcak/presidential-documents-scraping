Letter Declining To Accept Resignation of Samuel I. Rosenman as Special Counsel to the President.
Dear Sam:
I am finally taking action on your letter of resignation dated April 14, 1945. I am declining to accept it.
I understand fully your wish to retire to private life. President Roosevelt told me that you had forcibly expressed such a desire to him several times since last November, but that he had refused to let you go. The reasons which moved him are the same as those which now prompt this action by me.
The self-effacing zeal and patriotic devotion with which you have served your country and your President in recent years cannot yet be spared. I know the kind of work which you have been doing for the Chief Executive day in and day out during that time--seldom, if ever, with any public credit or acclaim.
And yet I know not only from President Roosevelt, but from my own personal experience during these recent months, how much your efforts have meant to the Chief Executive and to the welfare of our country. Some day when accurate history is written, you will receive the credit which is due you.
I want you to stay at your post at least until V-J Day in order that I may have your continued assistance.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Honorable Samuel I. Rosenman, The White House]
Note: Judge Rosenman's letter of resignation was released with the President's reply.
