Special Message to the Congress Transmitting Agreement Extending Interstate Compact To Conserve Oil and Gas.
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith a certified photostatic copy of an agreement, executed by the States of Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, Tennessee and Indiana, to extend for four years, commencing September 1, 1947, the Interstate Compact to Conserve Oil and Gas. The original of this agreement, in accordance with a provision contained therein, has been deposited in the archives of the Department of State.
The original compact between the States of Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Illinois, Colorado and Kansas was first executed in February 1935 and received the consent of Congress in August 1935. Since that time the original compact, with the consent of Congress, has been thrice extended and renewed for two-year periods and once for a period of four years, the last extension period expiring September 1, 1947. It is of interest to observe that the original compact, first ratified by six States, has now been ratified by sixteen. The increasing membership in this compact is especially encouraging at this time, in view of the necessity for the conservation of our resources of oil and gas.
I hope that the Congress will, by appropriate legislation, approve this extension agreement in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution of the United States.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: On July 12 the President signed a joint resolution approving the extension agreement (61 Stat. 316).
