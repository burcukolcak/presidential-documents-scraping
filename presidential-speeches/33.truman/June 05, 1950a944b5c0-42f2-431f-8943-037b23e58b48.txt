Statement by the President Upon Appointing a Committee To Review Veterans Hospitals.
IN ORDER to provide clarification of existing hospitalization problems and needs of disabled veterans, I have today appointed a special committee to review certain of these problems, especially those of the paraplegics and amputees.
The committee will consist of Dr. Howard A. Rusk, chairman of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at the New York University College of Medicine and Bellevue Hospital; Dr. Arthur Abramson, head of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at the Veterans Administration Hospital, Bronx, N.Y., an outstanding physician and himself a paraplegic; and Rear Adm. Robert L. Dennison, the Naval Aide to the President.
The committee has been authorized to call in consultants and specialists as it may find necessary. It will report its findings to me.
