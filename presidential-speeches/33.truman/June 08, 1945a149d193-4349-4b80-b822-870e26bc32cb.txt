Statement by the President on the Forthcoming Visit of President Rios of Chile.
IT IS A PLEASURE to announce that His Excellency Juan Antonio Rios, President of Chile, will visit the United States in October of this year as an official guest of this Government.
President Rios originally planned to visit the United States in 1942 by invitation of President Roosevelt. However, circumstances necessitated a postponement of the contemplated visit. It was my privilege to renew this invitation, and I am gratified that President Rios has found it possible to accept at this time. I look forward not only to welcoming President Rios to this country, but also to the pleasure of knowing him personally.
