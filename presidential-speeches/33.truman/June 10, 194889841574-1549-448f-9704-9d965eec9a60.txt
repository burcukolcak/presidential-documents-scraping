Statement by the President on the Death of Secretary Schwellenbach.
I HAVE heard with deepest grief of the death of Lewis Schwellenbach. He was my warm personal friend. He was a great Senator, a great judge, and a great Secretary of Labor.
Note: Lewis B. Schwellenbach served as Secretary of Labor from July 1, 1945, until his death on June 10, 1948.
