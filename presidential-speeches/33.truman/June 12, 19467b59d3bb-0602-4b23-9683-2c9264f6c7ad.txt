Letter Accepting Resignation of Randolph Paul as Special Assistant for Negotiations on German Assets in Switzerland.
[ Released June 12, 1946. Dated June 11, 1946 ]
Dear Randolph:
I have received your letter of May twenty-eighth informing me of the successful completion of the Allied negotiations with the Swiss Government on the subject of German assets in Switzerland. Knowing, as I do, the personal sacrifice made by you in taking on this responsibility and of your strong desire to return to the organization of your new firm, I feel that I cannot now ask you to assume additional responsibilities and, in accordance with your request, I reluctantly accept your resignation.
I shall look forward with interest to receiving the complete report which you are sending me concerning the negotiations. However, I do not need the report to know that the task entrusted to you was a difficult one and that you have handled it in the same meritorious fashion in which you have consistently discharged other responsibilities, both public and private. Your accomplishments in the Swiss negotiations are important steps in the rehabilitation of countries devastated by the war and the elimination of future threats to world security.
Please accept my personal thanks and I shall hope that you may before long be again in a position to use your talents in the service of the Government.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: Mr. Paul served as the President's Special Assistant for Negotiations on German Assets in Switzerland from February 28 to June 11, 1946. His letter of resignation was released with the President's reply.
