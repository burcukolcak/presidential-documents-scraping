Harry S. Truman
June 13, 1952

Remarks to Members of the International Society of Christian Endeavor.
WELL, we are mighty happy to have you here. It is a pleasure indeed to welcome such a fine-looking group of young people who have been studying citizenship, apparently.
I hope you have had a chance to see everything you want to see in the city of Washington, and that you will find some information attached to most of the places you visit that will do you good. The White House has been repaired. I think now it will stand up for at least 400 or 500 years--maybe longer than that. It was in a very dangerous condition when I had to tear it up.
I appreciate the privilege of welcoming these two young people who have won these prizes, and if the One More Club will come down here in front, why we'll let you take a picture of them.
Note: The President spoke at 3:30 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House.
