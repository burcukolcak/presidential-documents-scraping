Statement by the President on the Peace Treaties With Hungary, Rumania, and Bulgaria.
AT THE TIME of ratification of the treaties establishing peace with Hungary, Rumania, and Bulgaria, I feel I must publicly express regret that the governments of those countries not only have disregarded the will of the majority of the people but have resorted to measures of oppression against them. Ever since the liberation of these countries from the Nazi yoke and the commitments undertaken by the three Allies at Yalta, I had hoped that governments truly representative of the people would be established there. Such governments do not exist today in those three countries.
It is, however, in the interests of the Hungarian, Rumanian, and Bulgarian peoples to terminate the state of war which has existed between their governments and the United States for over 5 years. The establishment of peace will mean that all occupation forces (not including Soviet units needed to maintain lines of communication to the Soviet zone of occupation in Austria) will be withdrawn from these countries and armistice Control Commissions terminated.
Note: The treaties and related papers are published in the U.S. Statutes at Large: Hungary (61 Stat. 2065), Rumania (61 Stat. 1757), Bulgaria (61 Stat. 1915). The treaties entered into force September 15, 1947.
