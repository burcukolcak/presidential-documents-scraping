Remarks to Members of "Task Force Smith"
IT IS quite an admission for an artilleryman to make, but we couldn't fight a war without the infantry, I'm afraid.
I congratulate you men on the job you did in that original task force. Had it not been for the fact that these two divisions to which you belong had caused the Communists to hesitate, we possibly would not have been able to hold our position with the Korean Republic.
I hope you enjoy your stay here in Washington and that you will go back to your outfits and not tell them too many bad things about what you saw here in this Capital City of the world.
Any courtesies that we can extend to you, we will be glad to extend. We will make arrangements so that you can take a look at the refurbished White House, and I think you'll like it, but I wouldn't advise any of you to have the ambition to move in.
Note: The President spoke at 3:10 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. The group included 16 members of the 1st Battalion, 21st Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, the first American unit to see combat in Korea in July 1950. The battalion movement to Korea, called "Task force Smith," was named for its commander, Lt. Col. Charles B. Smith, who also headed the group that met with the President.
