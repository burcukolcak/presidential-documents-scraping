Statement by the President on Driving Safety.
MOTORISTS throughout the Nation will get an increase in their gasoline rations this week. This means more traffic on our streets and highways and more danger of accidents with loss of life and destruction of property.
Upon every man and woman who drives an automobile rests the responsibility of helping to avert this danger. Each can do his part by driving safely and by keeping his car in good operating condition.
The average automobile in use today is nearly twice as old as the average car on the highways before the war. Its mechanical condition is likely to be poor. Its tires are worn and often weak. Its brakes may be faulty. The International Association of Chiefs of Police advises me that a recent check-up showed one of every seven cars inspected in the United States and Canada had brakes that failed to meet minimum safety requirements.
By keeping his car in safe operating condition and by driving it with the utmost care, every motorist can help in relieving our serious transportation problem and thereby aid further in the whole war effort.
I am confident, in urging law enforcement officers everywhere to continue and increase their efforts, that all our people will give their full cooperation and support.
