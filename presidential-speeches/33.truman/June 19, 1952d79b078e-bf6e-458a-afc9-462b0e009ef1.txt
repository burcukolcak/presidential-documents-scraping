Harry S. Truman
June 19, 1952

Remarks to the Delegates to the 22d National 4-H Club Camp.
THIS HAS become an annual affair, and one to which I look forward.
There is only one thing I overlooked this morning. I forgot to put on my 4-H button, for which I apologize.
I think you young people, as I told you last year, are making a very great contribution to the welfare of--and the citizenship of-this great Republic of ours.
And you are also making a contribution to the good understanding between countries when you have young people from other parts of the world to come and cooperate with you, and learn what you are doing, so they can do the same thing for their countries back home.
I hope you enjoy your visit in Washington, and that you will come back again next year. In all probability I won't be here to meet you, but I understand exactly what you are trying to do, and I know the next President will be just as happy to receive you as I have been as long as I have been here.
Note: The President spoke at 11:50 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House.
