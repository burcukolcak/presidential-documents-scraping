Letter to Senator O'Mahoney Upon Signing Resolution Authorizing the Publication of "Economic Indicators."
Dear Senator O'Mahoney:
It is particularly important to our Government's efforts to promote the objective of maximum employment, production, and purchasing power, as set forth in the Employment Act of 1946, that there be broad public knowledge concerning economic facts and developments. It is, therefore with great pleasure that I am signing S.J. Res. 55, which authorizes the publication of "Economic Indicators," as a regular Government document.
It will now be possible for people throughout the country to follow each month the compilation of economic charts and statistics prepared for the Joint Committee on the Economic Report by the Council of Economic Advisers as this document will be available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents.
Please convey to each member of the Joint Committee on the Economic Report my appreciation for the constructive work your committee has done in bringing basic economic facts to the attention of the Congress and the people.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Joseph C. O'Mahoney, United States Senate, Washington, D.C.]
Note: As enacted, S.J. Res. 55 is Public Law 120 (63 Stat. 264).
