Statement by the President on Making Public a Progress Report on Famine Relief.
THE IMPRESSIVE RECORD made by the United States in shipping food grains abroad for famine relief is shown in a report I have just received from John W. Snyder, former Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion and now Secretary of the Treasury.
In six months, this country has shipped over five and a half million tons of bread grains to help feed the hungry people of other lands. In another three weeks, we shall have met our half-year goal of six million tons.
The very fact that housewives today often find it hard to buy a loaf of bread is evidence of the success of our famine emergency program. The loaf of bread and the bag of flour that they don't buy mean that much more for hungry children abroad.
The good record we have made is due to the splendid cooperation of Americans in conserving bread at home and in public eating places, the remarkable production American farmers, the unstinting cooperation of millers and bakers, and the united efforts of the Famine Emergency Committee and the various agencies of our Government.
But the crisis is not over. It will not be over when we reach our half-year goal. Cooperation and determined effort by the public--by each one of us--must be continued during the coming months of hunger abroad.
Soon after July 1, I will receive from the Secretary of Agriculture final figures not only on food grains but on the entire contribution of the United States toward meeting world food needs during the last full year.
Note: Mr. Snyder's report (3 pp., mimeographed), dated June 26, was released with the President's statement.
