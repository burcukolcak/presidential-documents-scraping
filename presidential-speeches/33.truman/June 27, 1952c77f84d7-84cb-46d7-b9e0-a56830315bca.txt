Harry S. Truman
June 27, 1952

Remarks to Members of the Board of the International Federation of Business and Professional Women.
IT IS a pleasure indeed to receive the international organization of business and professional women. I am particularly happy to have it a United Nations international affair, Dame Haslett.
I hope you have enjoyed yourselves in the United States, and that you will continue to enjoy yourselves, and that you will find things of interest to take back with you.
I think this is one of the ways to create international good feeling. When people associate with each other, they find out that there are not any serious differences between them, and that they can work for the welfare of the peace of the world. That's all any of us want.
We want peace in the world, and we will continue to work for that as long as it is possible to do so.
I expect to continue to work for the same peaceful program when I become a private citizen on the 20th day of next January, just as I have worked for practically 8 years as President of the United States.
Again I want to welcome you here. I hope you will continue to enjoy yourselves, in spite of this terrific heat, which I might say, in the California manner, is unusual.
Note: The President spoke at 12:20 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. Early in his remarks he referred to Dame Caroline Haslett, D.B.E., of London, England, President of the International Federation of Business and Professional Women.
The group had met in New York City, June 24-26.
