Joint Statement With the Prime Ministers of Great Britain and Canada Announcing Creation of the International Emergency Food Council.
THE PRESIDENT of the United States and the Prime Ministers of Great Britain and Canada issued the following statement today:
We announced on May 9, 1946 plans to continue the Combined Food Board until December 31, 1946 because of the deterioration that had occurred in the world food situation in recent months, and the need to control the distribution of many foods with a view to preventing widespread suffering and starvation.
Subsequent to this announcement, a Special Meeting on Urgent Food Problems was convened in Washington by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations on May 20. As a result of discussions at this meeting, certain recommendations with respect to the formation of an International Emergency Food Council were approved and submitted to the governments concerned.
It was a part of these recommendations that the governments of the United Kingdom, United States and Canada should arrange without delay for the Combined Food Board to call a meeting. This meeting was held on June 20, 1946, and was attended officially by representatives of nineteen countries who, on behalf of their governments, formally accepted the terms of reference of the International Emergency Food Council.
Accordingly, the International Emergency Food Council was established forthwith, and held its inaugural session on June 20. This organization will continue the work of the Combined Food Board which is hereby declared to be terminated as of July 1, 1946. The functions of the Combined Food Board, together with all its documents and records, will be transferred to the International Emergency Food Council on July 1, 1946.
Note: The statement was released simultaneously in Washington, London, and Ottawa at 10 a.m., Washington time.
