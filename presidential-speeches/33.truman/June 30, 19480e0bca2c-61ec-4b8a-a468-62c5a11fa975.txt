Message to the Congress Transmitting Second Report on the U.S. Foreign Aid Program.
To the Congress of the United States of America:
I am transmitting herewith the second quarterly report of expenditures and activities under the United States Foreign Aid Program authorized by Public Law 389 of the 80th Congress, approved December 17, 1947.
This report covers the period from January 1, 1948 through March 31, 1948, during which the flow of United States supplies to Austria, France, and Italy accomplished the purposes of the Foreign Aid Act of 1947--"to alleviate conditions of hunger and cold and prevent serious economic retrogression."
Pursuant to Section 5(d) of the act, this report also includes the statements of the governments of Austria, France, and Italy on the method of distribution and use of commodities made available under the act; the itemized list of commodities supplied each government, the average price at which each was sold, and the gross proceeds derived from these sales.
The supplies provided by the United States have freed the peoples of these three countries temporarily from the fear of starvation and want and enabled them to hold their economy intact until a long-range program could help them and other countries to a general European reconstruction. To the peoples of these countries, however, the gift of these supplies by the people of the United States meant something more--this aid represented also a symbol of hope for their future.
To us, the American people, our aid was an act of faith in a future in which free men shall prevail. The freely expressed will of the Italian people in their national election has already confirmed that faith.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
