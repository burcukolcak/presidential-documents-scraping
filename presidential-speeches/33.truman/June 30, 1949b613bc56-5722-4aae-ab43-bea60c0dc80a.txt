Special Message to the Congress Transmitting Report on Highway Needs.
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith a letter from the Administrator of the Federal Works Agency, enclosing a report on Highway Needs of the National Defense.
The report was prepared at the request of the Congress by the Commissioner of Public Roads in cooperation with the several State highway departments. In compliance with the request, the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Resources Board were invited to cooperate and have responded with suggestion of the indicated or potential needs for improved highways for the national defense. An expression of the views of the National Military Establishment, which has the concurrence of each of the military departments and agencies, is appended.
The larger part of the report presents information in detail concerning the condition of the highways of the country and their fitness to meet defense and civil needs, with particular reference to the National System of Interstate Highways. There is indication also of certain measures intended to permit the taking of prompt highway improvement action in the event of a national emergency.
This report is a useful document. I recommend it to the consideration of the Congress in connection with such further provision as may be made for the continuance of Federal aid for highway construction.
