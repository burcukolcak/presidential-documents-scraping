Remarks to a Group From the Eighth Annual Science Talent Search.
IT IS always a pleasure to meet those at the top in anything, and I understand that you won these honors by being at the top in the scientific essays which you wrote for this contest. I am sincerely hoping that all of you will go ahead with what you have started, and will come out at the top when you have finished.
There never was a time in the history of the world when we needed scientists and people of energy as we need them now. There is more room at the top now than ever in the history of the world.
Don't let anybody tell you that by effort and by hard work you can't reach the top in the profession, if you want to, because people who try to work and want to work are as scarce as the proverbial hen's teeth. Those people who want to work and are willing to shoulder responsibility will always find plenty of responsibility, and plenty of work. I think I am in a position to say that better than most anybody.
So just bear that in mind.
And I want to congratulate all of you. I appreciate the privilege of getting a chance to see all of you, and I hope that you will go out of here with the idea of finishing the job and becoming an asset to this great United States of America.
If at a later date the peace comes to the world, and we proceed to implement the policies which we are trying to inaugurate, there will be an immense number of jobs, and a greater number of jobs in your line than there will be men and women available to fill them. So bear that in mind.
I hope you will have a successful tour, and that you will finish the job which you have started.
Thank you very much. It is a pleasure to have you here.
Note: The President spoke at 11:30 a.m. in his office at the White House. The group included 40 young people from throughout the United States who were in Washington attending the Science Talent Institute sponsored by the Westinghouse Corporation.
