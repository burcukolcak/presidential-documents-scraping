Letter to the Chairman, Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments, Urging Action on Reorganization of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.
My dear Mr. Chairman:
I have been following with much interest the progress of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1952, providing for reorganization of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. I understand that your Committee has nearly completed its consideration of the plan and will soon file a report to the Senate.
Approval of Plan No. 1 is the most important step we can take to give our tax collecting agency an organization and a management that will assure the highest integrity and efficiency. I earnestly hope your Committee will take favorable action on the plan and that it will be approved by the Senate. The millions of Americans who are now preparing their tax returns are entitled to this progressive step.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN

[Honorable John L. McClellan, Chairman, Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments, United States Senate, Washington, D.C.]
