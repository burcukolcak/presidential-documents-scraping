CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD Of THE MEDAL FOR MERIT

TO

JOHN J. PELLEY
JOHN J. PELLEY, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the United States as President of the Association of American Railroads. Under Mr. Pelley's inspiring and aggressive leadership, the Association of American Railroads throughout the entire emergency period served to unite the efforts of the military establishment and the Nation's principal railroads in the expeditious and efficient movement of unprecedented freight and passenger traffic. Mr. Pelley has been an unfailing source of wise counsel and advice to the military establishment on all phases of railroad transportation. In the truest sense, he personifies the close cooperation, the untiring energy, and the efficient methods which enabled the Nation's railroads to achieve their outstanding and widely acclaimed success in meeting the domestic transportation requirements of the greatest war in history.
