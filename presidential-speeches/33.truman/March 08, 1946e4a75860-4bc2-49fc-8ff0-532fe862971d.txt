CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD Of THE MEDAL FOR MERIT

TO

J. EDGAR HOOVER
J. EDGAR HOOVER, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the United States. A preeminent citizen and public servant, Mr. Hoover has placed his opportunity to serve the citizens of the United States above personal interest. Under his able leadership as Director, the Federal Bureau of Investigation not only has become a powerful instrument of law enforcement in peacetime, but throughout the war years safeguarded the internal security of the United States, rendering ineffective espionage and preventing sabotage. Mr. Hoover's devotion to duty and outstanding administrative ability have contributed greatly to the welfare and defense of the Nation.
