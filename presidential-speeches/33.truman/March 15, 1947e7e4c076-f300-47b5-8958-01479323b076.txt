Statement by the President Concerning Greek Reaction to His Message.
I HAVE just received two warm and appreciative messages from Greece, one from Prime Minister Maximos and one from Mr. Themistocles Sophoulis, leader of the Parliamentary Opposition. Both of these messages welcome the prospect of the kind of American assistance which I recently requested Congress to authorize, and pledge the wholehearted support of the Greek people in devoting any aid that may be forthcoming to the purpose of constructive rehabilitation and the cause of peace and freedom. These two statements bear witness to the fact that all of the Greek Parliament, including the Opposition as well as those parties now represented in the Coalition cabinet, are prepared to cooperate unreservedly with the United States Government in its desire to assist Greece in restoring those basic conditions of economic stability and internal order which will allow the Greek people to build their future in peace and security.
I sincerely hope that these evidences of good will mark the beginning of a happier era for Greece, in which all loyal citizens will contribute their share toward the restoration of a country of whose democratic history they may be proud. It is also my profound hope that those Greeks who have taken up arms against their government will accept with confidence the amnesty which the Greek Government is extending to all except those guilty of crimes against the common law. The Greek people, aware of the sympathetic interest of the American people, will, I am sure, rally their strength to vitalize their national life, forgetting past excesses and looking courageously toward a hopeful future.
Note: The messages to the President from Demetrios Maximos, Prime Minister of Greece, and Themistocles Sophoulis, the leader of the Opposition Committee, were released with the President's statement.
