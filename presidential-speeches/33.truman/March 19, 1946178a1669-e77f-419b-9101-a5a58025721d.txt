Special Message to the Congress Transmitting Report Concerning the United Nations.
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith for the information of the Congress a copy of the Report on the activities of the American Delegation to the first Part of the first Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in London, England, January 10--February 14, 1946, submitted by the Secretary of State to the President of the United States under date of March 1, 1946.
The participation of the American representatives in the actual establishment of the institutions provided in the Charter of the United Nations, and in the initial work of the General Assembly regarding the urgent problems confronting the 51 Members of the United Nations today is vital to all Americans.
The United States supports the Charter. The United States supports the fullest implementation of the principles of the Charter. The United States seeks to achieve the purposes of the Charter. And the United States seeks to perfect the Charter as experience lights the way. To do less than our utmost in this essential effort of peace-loving nations, whatever may be the obstacles and difficulties, would be a betrayal of the trust of those who fought to win the opportunity to have a world at last with peace and security, and well-being, for all. To do our utmost will be to give new and full expression to the meaning of "America" to the world.
I commend to the attention of the Congress the enclosed report as constituting the Record, briefly told, of the part taken by our representatives in the progress so far made by the United Nations, now established and at work.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
