Executive Order 9835â€”Prescribing Procedures for the Administration of an Employees Loyalty Program in the Executive Branch of the Government
WHEREAS each employee of the Government of the United States is endowed with a measure of trusteeship over the democratic processes which are the heart and sinew of the United States; and
WHEREAS it is of vital importance that persons employed in the Federal service be of complete and unswerving loyalty to the United States; and
WHEREAS, although the loyalty of by far the overwhelming majority of all Government employees is beyond question, the presence within the Government service of any disloyal or subversive person constitutes a threat to our democratic processes; and
WHEREAS maximum protection must be afforded the United States against infiltration of disloyal persons into the ranks of its employees, and equal protection from unfounded accusations of disloyalty must be afforded the loyal employees of the Government:
NOW, Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, including the Civil Service Act of 1883 (22 Stat. 403), as amended, and section 9A of the act approved August 2, 1939 (18 U.S.C. 61i), and as President and Chief Executive of the United States, it is hereby, in the interest of the internal management of the Government, ordered as follows:
PART I - INVESTIGATION OF APPLICANTS
PART II - INVESTIGATION OF EMPLOYEES
PART III - RESPONSIBILITIES OF CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION
PART IV - SECURITY MEASURES IN INVESTIGATIONS
PART V - STANDARDS
PART VI - MISCELLANEOUS
