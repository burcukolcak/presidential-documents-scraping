Statement by the President on the Forthcoming Visit of the President of France.
PRESIDENT Vincent Auriol of France, Mme. Auriol, their son Paul, French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman, and members of their official party are already on the high seas on their way to this country as official guests of the U.S. Government.
This Government is looking forward with great pleasure to this visit and I shall be very happy to welcome our distinguished guests.
France and the United States have a long history of inspiring friendship. And the ties between the two countries, as partners in the struggle to achieve peace in the world, have never been closer.
I wish our visitors a very pleasant voyage. I am honored and delighted to have them come.
