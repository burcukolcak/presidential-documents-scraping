Statement by the President on the 128th Anniversary of the Independence of Greece.
I HAVE been deeply impressed by the "Work and Victory" manifestations in Greece, demonstrating the united will of the Greek people to labor and fight for the preservation of their ancient democratic heritage and of their independence, so proudly proclaimed 128 years ago today. I have also been moved by the concurrent expressions of Greek appreciation of American aid and of the Greek people's determination to use the help extended by their American and other friends to the best advantage.
Greek heroism displayed in the Greek War of Independence and in the First and Second World Wars evoked the admiration and enlisted the support of Americans. Today, on this anniversary of Greek independence, the reaffirmation of Greek resistance to a new alien threat is a further shining example of courage in the face of adversity.
Despite the continuing ravages of the foreign-inspired guerrilla warfare, the Greek people remain determined to rebuild their own land in their own way, in freedom and in peace. This is the significance of the "Work and Victory" rally. The spirit of the people and the recent successes of the Greek armed forces confirm my confidence that the new totalitarian pressure will be contained, whatever difficulties may lie ahead.
The American people are proud of their part in helping to preserve Greek independence and the structure of world peace through the Greek aid program.
