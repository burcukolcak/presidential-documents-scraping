THE PRESIDENT of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Gold Star in lieu of the Third Distinguished Service Medal to
FLEET ADMIRAL WILLIAM D. LEAHY,

UNITED STATES NAVY
for service set forth in the following
CITATION:
For exceptionally meritorious service to the Government of the United States in duty of great responsibility as Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States and concurrently as Member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from February 1, 1946 to March 21, 1949. Eminently qualified by his experience in the fields of government and international affairs, Fleet Admiral Leahy contributed his deep wisdom and judgment to the guidance of his country following the victorious conclusion of the last war. His supreme loyalty to his country and his appreciation of its place in world affairs, supplemented by his fundamental concern in the welfare of humanity as a whole, transcended his already vast knowledge of military affairs to culminate in statesmanship beyond that required of any Naval officer in our history. A champion of democracy and respecter of sovereignty, defender of independence, and humanitarian in his recognition of peoples' needs and rights, the great accomplishments attained in consequence of Fleet Admiral Leahy's guidance bring to him unparalleled distinction. His service to the Commander in Chief, the Nation and humanity, exemplary in its brilliance and accomplishment, reflects the highest credit upon Fleet Admiral Leahy and enhances the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.
