CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE LEGION OF MERIT DEGREE OF CHIEF COMMANDER TO MIGUEL ALEMAN
HIS EXCELLENCY Miguel Aleman, President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Mexico, has displayed unswerving friendship to the United States and to the ideals of the Good Neighbor Policy, the success of which he has done so much to assure. His eagerness to enhance the bonds of friendship between Mexico and the United States and his strong backing of the progressive and liberal foreign policy of his government have established a shining pattern of the spirit which is making Pan Americanism the true brotherhood of the nations of America.
