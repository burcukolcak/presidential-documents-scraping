Statement by the President Concerning the Termination of the Office of Civilian Defense.
THIS CHANGE does not in any respect lessen the need for volunteer efforts in our states and communities. State and local governments are fully aware of their continuing responsibilities, and I am sure that we can depend upon their knowledge and the patriotism of the millions of volunteers to continue the war jobs in which the whole nation has had to be trained. Protection volunteers, such as auxiliary firemen and policemen, working with state and local governments have done a magnificent job through their defense councils in organizing to protect the nation against the threat of enemy action, sabotage, and other war hazards. Civilian War Services volunteers have likewise rendered invaluable assistance.
The millions of volunteer workers throughout the nation, giving freely of their time, have been basic to the strength of our democracy. I know they will willingly continue to serve. Under General Haskell's able direction the OCD has provided needed assistance to the defense councils and volunteers in carrying on their important work in advancing the war effort on the home front.
Note: This statement was made public as part of a White House release stating that the President had that day written to the Congress announcing the forthcoming termination of the Office of Civilian Defense and withdrawing its proposed budget for the next fiscal year. The release further stated that developments in the European war and the efficient operation of community volunteer forces made possible the decision that Federal supervision of civilian defense was no longer needed.
The Office of Civilian Defense was terminated by Executive Order 9562, effective June 30, 1945 (3 CFR, 1942-1948 Comp., p. 388).
