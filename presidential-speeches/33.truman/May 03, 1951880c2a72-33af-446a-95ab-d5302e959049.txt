Remarks to a Group of Foreign Journalists.
IT IS a very great pleasure for me this morning to have the privilege of meeting you gentlemen. I hope you are having a pleasant visit in this country of ours, and that you will find out some things for yourselves that when you go back you can say will be true.
That is what we are interested in, in this around-the-world effort of ours to get peace. If we can get the truth to the people, the peace will come automatically. That is one of the hardest things to do.
I have heard some of the greatest publications on the Continent--in Great Britain, Asia, Africa--mentioned this morning when you were introduced to me, and I am happy that you are here. If there is anything we can do to contribute to your enjoyment, or to furnish you with any information that you are interested in, I hope all the people meeting you and seeing that you see things will work with you. If they don't, maybe if you will tell me about it, they will.
Note: The President spoke at 12:10 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House.
