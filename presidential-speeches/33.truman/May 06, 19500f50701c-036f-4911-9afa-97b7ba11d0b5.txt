Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Establishing a Uniform Code of Military Justice.
[Released May 6, 1950. Dated May 5, 1950]
I HAVE today approved H.R. 4080 which establishes a Uniform Code of Military Justice equally applicable to all of the Armed Forces of the United States in time of war and peace.
It is particularly appropriate that this Uniform Code of Military Justice should be enacted into law on the eve of the first Armed Forces Day. The Code is one of the outstanding examples of unification in the Armed Forces and is tangible evidence of the achievements possible by the coordinated teamwork of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard.
Under the provisions of this uniform and modern Code, the democratic ideal of equality before the law is further advanced.
It has given me pleasure, therefore, to sign H.R. 4080. I compliment the members of the Department of Defense committee who drafted the bill and the Members of the Congress who contributed so much to its enactment.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 4080 is Public Law 506, 81st Congress (64 Stat. 107).
