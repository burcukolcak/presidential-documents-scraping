Statement by the President Concerning Final Burial of the Dead of World War II.
THE WAR and Navy Departments recently began their inquiries to determine the wishes of the next of kin concerning the final burial of the men and women who gave their lives in our country's service during World War II. In compliance with the directions given by the Congress, the desires of the next of kin will be followed as promptly as is practicable.
It is possible that in making their decision some of the relatives of these brave men and women desire assurance that their dead shall rest in dignity and honor--a desire which would be satisfied by the prospect of visiting the burial places in our national cemeteries or in the local cemeteries near their homes. I feel sure, however, that if they could see for themselves the care which is devoted to the graves of those who died in the First World War, and to the temporary cemeteries in which their own dead lie buried today, many of the next of kin would prefer that their loved ones should rest forever in the countries where they fell.
I believe, therefore, that our Government should make possible a pilgrimage to the permanent cemeteries overseas. To this pilgrimage should be invited those of the next of kin who elect that their sons or husbands shall rest in permanent cemeteries overseas under the care of their Government. It should be organized after the permanent military cemeteries have been established and after the erection of headstones and memorial chapels has sufficiently advanced to give reassurance of the perpetual care which our country will devote to the resting places of our honored dead.
