His Excellency Harry S. Truman:
Upon leaving the territory of the United States, I desire to express to .you once again my deep gratitude for all the courtesies which you were so good as to extend to me during my stay in your great country, for whose happiness I express sincere wishes as President of a people which believes deeply in the democratic solidarity of liberty-loving men, governed by justice and associated in progress.
The spirit of complete and reciprocal understanding which guided all our conversations in Washington as well as in Mexico is an excellent guarantee of the cordiality of our Republics.
In view of your high qualities as a statesman and as a man which give value to your noble sincerity, that spirit of understanding has found in you a strong champion of inter-American cohesion.
Confident that the cordiality to which I refer will continue to be the best basis for strengthening and promoting the relations of our governments and our peoples, I repeat to you, Mr. President, the sentiments of my constant and steadfast friendship.
MIGUEL ALEMAN
