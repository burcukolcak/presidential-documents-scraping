CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE MEDAL FOR MERIT TO JOHN WESLEY SNYDER
JOHN WESLEY SNYDER, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the United States from August, 1940 to August, 1943. Mr. Snyder, as Executive Vice President of the Defense Plant Corporation, effectively directed the detailed organization of the Corporation to provide for the financing and construction of facilities required for the successful prosecution of the war. As a result of his foresight, initiative, and great ability he played an outstanding part in providing American industry and the Armed Services with the machine tools and plants with which to forge the weapons for victory. Under his aggressive leadership and diligent efforts, aircraft plants were constructed and equipped in a minimum of time, and the productive capacity to support a modern air force was thus established. Mr. Snyder's achievements and patriotic devotion reflect the highest credit upon himself and the Government of the United States.
