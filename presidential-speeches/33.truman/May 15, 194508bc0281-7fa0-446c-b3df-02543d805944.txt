Statement by the President on German Reparations.
A FAIR and workable settlement of reparations poses some of the most difficult problems of the entire post-war adjustment. These questions are closely related to the task of insuring a lasting peace. For that reason, the right answers will be vital to the security of America and the world.
I personally concur in the general view of our own objectives as shared by Ambassador Pauley and Dr. Lubin. Absolute insurance against German or Japanese rearmament--ever again--comes first with us.
I believe, further, that our allies are of one mind with us on this point, and that with such a basic agreement, the way will be clear for a just and equitable schedule of German reparations--reparations "in kind" which will provide the maximum of rehabilitation and restoration of overrun territory.
The men chosen for this vital mission should inspire the confidence of all Americans. They are eminently qualified to do the job.
Note: At the time this statement was made public the White House also released a list of members of the staff selected by Mr. Pauley and Dr. Lubin to accompany them to Germany.
