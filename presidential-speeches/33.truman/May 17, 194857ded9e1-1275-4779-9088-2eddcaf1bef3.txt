Letter to Secretary Forrestal on the Atomic Weapons Tests at Eniwetok.
Dear Mr. Secretary:
The Atomic Energy Commission has reported to me on the results of the tests of atomic weapons at the Commission's Eniwetok Proving Ground. The Chairman and members of the Commission join me in congratulations to you on the work of Joint Task Force Seven which carried out the tests for the Commission.
The successful completion of this mission is an outstanding example of cooperation between the Agencies responsible for the military defense of the nation and those responsible for the scientific and technical development of an important means of defense.
Please convey to the Commander of Join Task Force Seven and to all of the member of the National Military Establishment who contributed to the success of the undertaking my commendation for a job well done.
I know you share my feelings of gratification at the accomplishments of the Commission's Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, as indicated by the results of the test program. I have asked the Commission to convey my commendation to all the civilian personnel involved both in the development work leading up to these tests and in the actual conduct of the proof test program.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Honorable, the Secretary of Defense, Washington, D.C.]
Note: A White House release of May 17, summarizing the Commission's report, stated that the tests of three atomic weapons of improved design were successful in all respects, and that the results indicated very substantial progress. The release added that the President gave general approval of Commission plans to initiate further nuclear development based upon information gained from the tests.
