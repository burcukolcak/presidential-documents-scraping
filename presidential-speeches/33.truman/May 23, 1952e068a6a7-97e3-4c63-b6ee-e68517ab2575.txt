Letter to the Secretary of the Army Directing Him To Terminate Control of the Railroads.
Dear Mr. Secretary:
The labor disputes underlying the issuance of Executive Order No. 10141, dated July 8, 1950, and Executive Order No. 10155, dated August 25, 1950, have now been settled and interruptions in normal rail service no longer threaten.
It is, accordingly, in order for you to initiate immediate steps for the termination of possession, control and operation of the transportation systems affected by the above mentioned Executive Orders to become effective at the earliest feasible moment.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Honorable, The Secretary of the Army, Washington, D.C.]
