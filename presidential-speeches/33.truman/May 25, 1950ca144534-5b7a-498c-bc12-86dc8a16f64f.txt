Statement by the President on the Joint Declaration on the Near East.
DURING the recent meeting in London, the Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France had an opportunity to review the security and armaments situation in the Near East and to consider what action their Governments might take to provide greater stability in the area. As a result of this consultation, a three-power declaration is being issued. This is another of the many valuable results of the London meeting.
The participation of the United States Government in the declaration emphasizes this country's desire to promote the maintenance of peace in the Near East. It is the belief of the United States Government that the declaration will stimulate, in the Arab States and Israel, increased confidence in future security, thus accelerating the progress now being made in the Near East and contributing toward the well-being of the peoples there.
