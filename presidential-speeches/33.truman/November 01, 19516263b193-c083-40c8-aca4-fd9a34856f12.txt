Letter to Frieda B. Hennock on Her Decision To Decline a Recess Appointment as a Federal Judge.
[Released November 1, 1951. Dated October 31, 1951]
Dear Miss Hennock:
I regret that the Senate Judiciary Committee has not taken action on the confirmation of your appointment as a United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, as I think you are highly qualified and would have served with distinction. I am mindful of the reason which you have advanced for declining a recess appointment, and I reluctantly defer to your wishes in the matter.
Your outstanding record as a member of the Federal Communications Commission has earned wide public recognition, and I am confident your continued service on the Commission will advance the public interest in the vital field of communications. Your service has provided an outstanding example of the contributions which the women of America have to offer the people of this country, particularly in these critical times.
With assurance of my continued confidence I am,

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Frieda B. Hennock, Commissioner, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C.]
