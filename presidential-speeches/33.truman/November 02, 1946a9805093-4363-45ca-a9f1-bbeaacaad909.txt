Statement by the President on the Status of the 48 Estonian Refugees.
ON OCTOBER 24 I announced that I had directed that all avenues be explored toward enabling the 48 Estonian refugees who recently entered the United States without immigration visas to remain here, if they so desired, so that they might eventually become citizens of this country.
I am pleased to announce that as a result of the joint efforts of the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, these refugees will definitely not be deported and will in due course be given immigration visas which will enable them to remain in this country.
