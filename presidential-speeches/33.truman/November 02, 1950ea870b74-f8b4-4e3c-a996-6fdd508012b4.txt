Message to the Governor of Puerto Rico Regarding the Recent Uprisings.
PLEASE convey to the families of the members of the insular police and the National Guard killed or wounded in the criminal attacks on established authority during the past few days my deepest sympathy. Those who have died or suffered wounds in defense of law and order and of democratic government deserve the gratitude of the Nation no less than those who have died for the same great cause on the field of battle. I am glad to learn that the situation is now under control and that the insular authorities have taken all necessary steps for the preservation of order.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Luis Munoz Marin, Governor of Puerto Rico, San Juan, P.R.]
Note: On October 30, 1950, members of the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico began a series of disturbances throughout the island in connection with the forthcoming referendum (see Item 278 [3]). The insular police and the National Guard brought the situation under control. As part of the same movement, two Nationalists attempted the life of President Truman (see Item 278 [4] ).
