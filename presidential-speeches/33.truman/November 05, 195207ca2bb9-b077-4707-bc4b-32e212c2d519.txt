Telegram to the President-Elect.
General Dwight D. Eisenhower:
Thank you for your prompt and courteous reply to my telegram. I know you will agree with me that there ought to be an orderly transfer of the business of the Executive branch of the Government to the new Administration, particularly in view of the international dangers and problems that confront this country and the whole free world. I invite you, therefore, to meet with me here in the White House at your early convenience to discuss the problems of this transition period, so that it may be made clear to all the world that this Nation is united in its struggle for freedom and peace.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
