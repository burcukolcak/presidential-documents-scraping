Executive Order 10017â€”Amendment of the Regulations Governing the Appointment of Postmasters of the Fourth Class
WHEREAS under the regulations now in force the appointment of postmasters of the fourth class may be made upon the basis of investigation and report of a post office inspector in any case in which the compensation of the office is not in excess of $1000 per annum; and
WHEREAS it is deemed desirable and in the public interest that the said limitation of $1000 be raised to $1300:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Civil Service Act (22 Stat. 403) and section 1753 of the Revised Statutes (5 U.S.C. 631), and for the purpose of carrying out the objective aforesaid, the regulations prescribed or approved by the President governing the appointment of postmasters of the fourth class are hereby amended by substituting "$1300" for "$1000" wherever the latter sum appears in the regulations.
This order supersedes Executive Order No. 9769 of August 14, 1946, entitled "Amendment of the Regulations Governing the Appointment of Postmasters of the Fourth Class."
