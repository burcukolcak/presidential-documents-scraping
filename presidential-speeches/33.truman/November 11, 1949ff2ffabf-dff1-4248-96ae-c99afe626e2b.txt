Letter Accepting Resignation of Julius A. Krug as Secretary of the Interior.
Dear Cap:
Your letter of November tenth confirms the wish you had often expressed in our previous talks and leaves me no alternative. I therefore accept reluctantly and with sincere regret your resignation as the Secretary of the Interior, effective as you desire, as of December first next.
The outcome of the elections earlier this week, as you thoughtfully wrote, registers a popular conviction that increases our responsibility. We have indeed done a pretty good job in accomplishing our objectives. In government, as in every field of human activity, the work is never done. We must go forward with progress, remembering always that the only evidence of life is growth.
Particularly in the great Department which you have administered now for the better part of four years is this true. The people of this entire nation have a stake in the steady development of our incalculable resources in the great western domain. It would be hazardous to the nation to accept the "status quo." As you wisely observe, hostility to change is too often inspired by narrow timidity and selfish fear.
For all that you have done to translate administration policy into action in the Department of the Interior you have my hearty gratitude and appreciation. It is reassuring to know, as you leave the Department, that we will have your continued support in the development of the western program.
With every good wish for your continued happiness and success,
Cordially and sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Julius A. Krug, Secretary of the Interior, Washington, D.C.]
Note: Mr. Krug served as Secretary of the Interior from February 26, 1946, until December 1, 1949. His letter of resignation was released with the President's reply.
