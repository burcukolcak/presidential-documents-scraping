Letter to President Osmena of the Philippines Upon Approving a Bill of the Philippine Congress.
My dear President Osmena:
I have for some time delayed my approval of House Bill No. 176 of the first Philippine Congress, which provides a reduction of the required gold coverage of Philippine currency. This delay has been due to the fact that there have been persistent charges that a sizable fraction of the Members of the Philippine Congress had been guilty of collaboration with the enemy, and I have not wanted my approval of the act to be distorted into approval of collaboration.
I am informed, however, that the provisions of House Bill No. 176 are necessary to the effective conduct of the Philippine Government and I accordingly have approved the act. At the same time, I should like to emphasize that my signature is in no sense an approval of the presence in the Philippine Congress of any person who has given aid to the enemy or his political policies.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Sergio Osmena, President of the Philippines, 1617 Massachusetts Avenue NW., Washington 6, D.C. ]
