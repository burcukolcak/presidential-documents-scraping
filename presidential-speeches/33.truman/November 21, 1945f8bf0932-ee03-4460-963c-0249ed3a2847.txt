By virtue of the authority placed in me by the act approved April 19, 1945, granting the consent of Congress to the States of Colorado and Kansas to negotiate and enter into a compact for the division of the waters of the Arkansas River, I am appointing you, effective January 1, 1946, representative of the United States to participate in the negotiations between the States and to make the necessary reports to Congress.
I am asking the Congress to provide funds to the Geological Survey of the Department of the Interior for the payment of your compensation, which I am setting at a per diem rate of $100 for the time, including time performed in travel, actually spent on the work involved, and for expenses incurred as a result of your undertaking this office. You are authorized under this appointment to undertake in accordance with standard government travel regulations such travel as may be necessary between your home and such points as may be proper in the conduct of the work.
Prior to submitting to Congress any reports you are required to make under the law, I would like you to send them to me through the Director of the Bureau of the Budget.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
