Statement by the President on the Death of William Green.
WILLIAM GREEN, for more than half a century, held a place of responsible leadership in American life. For nearly 28 of those years he was president of the American Federation of Labor and as such helped to improve the working, living, and economic conditions of millions of American wage earners. His success is a monument to his labor statesmanship.
He visualized trade unions as making a great and growing contribution to the Nation and saw them playing a vital, constructive, and responsible part in the growth of our country. He long had fought to prevent employment discrimination against minorities because of race, creed, or national origin. He recognized the relation of American workers to those in other countries and had supported the international labor movement. He encouraged trade unions everywhere in their struggles for political democracy, economic progress, and world peace.
Along the way he had served his State and his Nation. He cheerfully represented labor on various Government boards and committees. He was a fine American patriot who dedicated his life to the service of those who work. He was a friend to me and to thousands of others, to whom his wise counsel and understanding were helpful always. He will be missed by Americans in all walks of life.
