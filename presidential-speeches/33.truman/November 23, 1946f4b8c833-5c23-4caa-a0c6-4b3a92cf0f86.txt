Statement by the President Concerning Myron Taylor's Mission in Rome.
I HAVE directed my personal representative, the Honorable Myron C. Taylor, to proceed to Rome for a brief period to resume discussion of matters of importance with His Holiness Pope Plus XII and others in authority. Mr. Taylor will also resume his efforts in respect to the reorganization of the Italian Red Cross and his chairmanship of American relief for Italy.
Mr. Taylor's work as the guiding force and leading spirit in organizing American relief for Italy already has been fruitful of practical results. Italy has been in sore need from the time of the invasion and during and since the war. Noteworthy among his activities has been his work among youngsters rendered homeless by the ravages of war, along lines comparable with those which have animated Boys Town and other agencies dealing at the present time with the problem of juvenile delinquency in the United States. His hope is that the reorganized Italian Red Cross will become the active medium for all national relief distribution in Italy.
Mr. Taylor's forthcoming mission to Italy will be of short duration--not exceeding thirty days. in resuming his conversations with the Pope he will continue his mission in behalf of peace. His purpose, as on previous missions, will be to obtain for my guidance the counsel and cooperation of all men and women of good will whether in religion, in government, or in the pursuits of everyday life.
As in the past he and I will, in our labors for peace, continue to welcome the advice of leaders in religion of all convictions and loyalties, however diverse, not only in this country but throughout the world.
