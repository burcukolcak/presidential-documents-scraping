Letter Accepting Resignation of Robert E. Hannegan as Postmaster General.
Dear Bob:
It would not be possible for me to overstate the feeling of personal regret with which I have read your letter of yesterday advising me of your determination to return to private life.
The sense of regret is deepened because of the close friendship which has obtained between us for so long and because the country is losing the services of a most efficient public servant.
You have given the government more than five years of devoted service. My lamented predecessor trusted and admired you. Now for more than two years you have justified my own faith through your admirable administration of the office of Postmaster General, whose duties are onerous as well as complex.
I know that your influence and your talents will always be dedicated to the cause of progress at home and justice and a permanent peace among the nations of the world.
With every assurance that I heartily reciprocate your warm personal sentiments, I accept, with reluctance, your resignation as Postmaster General, effective at the close of business on December first.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Robert E. Hannegan, The postmaster General, Washington, D.C.]
Note: Mr. Hannegan served as postmaster General from May 8, 1945, to December 1, 1947. His letter of resignation, dated November 24, was released with the President's reply.
