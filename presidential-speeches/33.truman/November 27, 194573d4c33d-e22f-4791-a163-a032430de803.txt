MERIT DEGREE OF COMMANDER
LIEUTENANT GENERAL Sir Gordon N. Macready, K.B.E., C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., M.C., performed exceptionally meritorious service as Commander, British Army Staff, Washington, from June 1942 to September 1945. He represented the British Army Council in North America and was responsible for all liaison between the British War Office and the United States War Department. During his tenure the Allied armies victoriously assaulted Fortress Europe from all sides and brought the war on that continent to a successful conclusion. To this combined achievement, he made a distinguished contribution by assuring close and complete liaison, thus aiding materially in the task of developing and delivering the full measure of our military might. As representative of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on the Combined Chiefs of Staff, General Macready gave a full measure of his rich military experience and superior judgment to the making of important strategic decisions. As British military representative on the Munitions Assignment Board and the Combined Production and Resources Board, he rendered highly valuable services in the determination of policies related to the combined logistical effort. As a member of the Combined Civil Affairs Committee, he demonstrated his wisdom and keenness of insight in dealing with problems affecting the rehabilitation of a war-ravaged world. By his outstanding performance of duty, General Macready reflected great credit upon himself as a soldier and upon the British Army which he represented.
