FIELD MARSHAL Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, G.C.B., G.B.E., D.S.O., performed outstanding and distinguished services as head of the British Joint Staff Mission from January to September 1945. As the military representative of the Prime Minister, he was charged with the responsibility of presenting to the United States Government the views and policy of His Majesty's Government on military matters, and was a British member of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in Washington. He coordinated the activities of the Air Staff, the Army Staff and the British Admiralty Delegation. Drawing on his rich experience and thorough knowledge of military affairs and exercising profound diplomacy, he played an important role in the development and execution of the Allied strategy leading to victory. By his untiring energy and singleness of purpose in the conduct of a mission of highest importance, Field Marshal Wilson made a practical contribution of the greatest significance to the difficult task of coordinating the combined military effort on all levels.
