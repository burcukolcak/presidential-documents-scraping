THE PRESIDENT, Yes sir.
Q. But you did not mean that that would catch up with the a billion, one?
THE PRESIDENT. I didn't say that, either. I am doing my best to catch up with the 2 billion, one, and I think we are going to do it. I would like to make that perfectly plain.
Q. How is that 2 billion, one going to be cut off, Mr. President?
