Letter to James E. Markham Upon the Conclusion of His Duties as Alien Property Custodian.
My dear Mr. Markham:
It is my privilege to send you a hearty: well done, as you terminate your duties as Alien Property Custodian.
I had full confidence that in anticipation of the proposed consolidation your house would be completely in order. Accordingly today I have signed an Executive Order terminating the Office of Alien Property Custodian and transferring all of its duties and functions to the Attorney General, to be administered through the Department of Justice.
You were familiar with the policy of reducing the number of separate agencies in the interest of economy and efficiency. By reason of your knowledge of the working of the Alien Property Office from its establishment, you were able to give me valuable counsel in bringing about the change now happily completed. The terminal report which you submitted with your letter of this date will be most helpful to those who are to carry on the work which you have relinquished.
You have earned the thanks of the Nation for the manner in which you have acquitted yourself in performing the difficult tasks which fell to you as Alien Property Custodian. Your integrity, your efficiency and your all around ability to get on with the work have contributed in the performance of a job which merits my highest praise and heartfelt appreciation.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
