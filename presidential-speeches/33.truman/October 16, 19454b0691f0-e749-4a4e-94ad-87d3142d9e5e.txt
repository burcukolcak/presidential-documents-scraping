Statement by the President Following the Visit of President Rios of Chile.
PRESIDENT RIOS of Chile left Washington yesterday after an official visit, during which it was my privilege to have him as a guest at the White House. It was a great pleasure to meet him, not only as a friend and statesman, but also as the representative of a democratic people and a functioning democracy.
We discussed the mutual desire to strengthen the solidarity of the republics of the Western Hemisphere on the basis of the ideals for which the war was fought and won.
