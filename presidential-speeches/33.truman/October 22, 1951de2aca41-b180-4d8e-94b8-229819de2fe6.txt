Harry S. Truman
October 22, 1951

Remarks to a Group of Industrialists From Colombia.
IT IS a pleasure to welcome you here this morning. I hope you have had and will have a successful visit here, and get all the information you are anxious to have.
We are more than happy over the relationship between your great Republic and ours. In fact, I think our relations with our neighbors were never better. I think we have made a reputation of being really friendly neighbors.
I don't think there are any of our sister republics, or the Dominion of Canada, that are afraid of us. They know we have no ulterior motives, and what we do with them and what we want is just what you are doing: a distribution of goods and services on the basis that will be right for everybody.
And I hope that you will get that impression, and take it back home with you.
Note: The President spoke at 12:10 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House.
