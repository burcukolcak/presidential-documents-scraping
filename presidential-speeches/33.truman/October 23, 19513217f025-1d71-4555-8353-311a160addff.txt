Remarks Upon Presenting the Harmon International Trophy to Col. David C. Schilling.
IT GIVES ME a great deal of pleasure to make this presentation this morning to Colonel Schilling.
I have the honor to hand you the certificate and the medal. The trophy is a little too big to carry, but we will go around and uncover it.
I congratulate you. I congratulate the Air Force, and I congratulate you on the success you have had in getting a jet across the Atlantic for the first time without a stop-- something very fine for the welfare of the country and the world, I think.
I hope you will continue to work on these things.
Note: The President spoke at 12:15 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. He presented the Harmon International Trophy to Col. David Schilling, USAF, who had been selected as the outstanding aviator for 1950. On September 22, 1950, Colonel Schilling successfully flew a Republic F-84E Thunderjet from Manston, England, to Limestone Air Force Base in Maine, accomplishing by means of in-flight refueling the first nonstop transatlantic jet aircraft flight.
