Statement by the President Commemorating the Founding of the Czechoslovak Republic.
ON BEHALF of the American people, I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to President Benes and the Czechoslovak people on the occasion of the twenty-eighth Anniversary of the Independence of the Czechoslovak Republic. The occasion brings to mind once more the close ties of friendship which have bound the Czechoslovak and American peoples in their common struggles against the foes of democracy and freedom. The events of the past twenty-eight years have demonstrated the enduring strength of the principles upon which our two republics were rounded, and will inspire in our peoples continued devotion to these principles.
