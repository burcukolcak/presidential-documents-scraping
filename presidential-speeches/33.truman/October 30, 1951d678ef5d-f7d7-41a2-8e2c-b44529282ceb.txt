Remarks at a Luncheon for Vice Admiral Ross T. McIntire.
Mr. Chairman, Admiral:
I came over here unexpectedly today, after I heard that the Admiral was having a tribute paid to him, to add my nickel's worth to the performance.
I want to say to you that Admiral McIntire is in that category of people that were in the military service when I came to the White House who has been willing to do anything that is necessary for the welfare of the country, and anything that the President has ever asked him to do.
He is now in the midst of a program that is of vital importance to the Nation, the rehabilitation of the handicapped--doing a wonderful job at it. I have been in cooperation with him, and I hope that he receives the best of treatment by you here today; and I hope that when he takes his departure for the Far West, that he will still keep his connections here and come back when it is necessary in order to efficiently perform his mission.
I have a large number of people in the class of Admiral McIntire who are all willing to do whatever is necessary for the welfare of the country. It is one of the great satisfactions of being in the office that I occupy that there are people who put the welfare of the Nation above their own personal interests. And you would be surprised how many of our public servants are in that category.
I appreciate the privilege you gave me, to come over and pay tribute to the Admiral. And I hope that you will have a most successful meeting.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 1:05 p.m. at the Carlton Hotel in Washington.
Admiral McIntire, former Surgeon General of the Navy and White House physician from 1933 to 1945, had resigned as chairman for medical policies and procedures of the Red Cross national blood program. He retired from the Navy in 1947.
