Statement by the President on Federal Employees Displaced by the Reduction-in -Force.
SECRETARY JOHNSON is making all possible effort to place the employees who are being released from the Department of Defense. In addition, I request all Federal appointing officers to give first consideration to career employees who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own.
I have asked the Civil Service Commission particularly to continue its efforts to place such employees and give them proper priority consideration for Federal jobs. I am confident that every effort will be made by the Federal departments and agencies to cooperate fully with the Commission in hiring as many of these employees as can be effectively utilized.
It is unrealistic to expect, however, that all these employees can be placed in current vacancies in the Federal service, which very properly is contracting in size. Many of the released employees have skills that are not now required in other Federal positions. Therefore, I hope that they will receive full consideration from employers in private industry. This reduction has affected employees who have given years of excellent service to their country, and are highly skilled and efficient workers. The facilities of the U.S. Employment Service, cooperating with the State Employment Services, are at the disposal of these employees and hiring officials of business concerns.
Through such a cooperative program, I hope that this phase of our postwar readjustment can be made with the least possible hardship to these employees and their families.
