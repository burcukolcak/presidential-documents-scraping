Remarks in San Francisco to the Delegates to the Japanese Peace Conference.
THANK YOU very much. It is a pleasure to be with you tonight. I want to welcome all of you to this conference.
I am very sure that when we have finished this conference we will have made a step forward for peace in the world.

I wish it were possible for me to meet every one of you personally and shake your hand, but that isn't possible, much to my regret, but just the same I am going to welcome you here with a handshake.
Note: The President spoke at 9:30 p.m. at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. See also Item 216.
