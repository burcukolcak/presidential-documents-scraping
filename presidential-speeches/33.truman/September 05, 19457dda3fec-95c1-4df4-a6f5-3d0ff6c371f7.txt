The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I just called you in to give you an announcement on the Roosevelt Memorial Association meeting over in the White House. It was well attended, and the various proposals for memorials were discussed, and it was finally agreed to appoint a committee to nominate officers for the Roosevelt Memorial Association into an enlarged executive committee and to study plans and call another meeting to report back to the Executive Committee again. And the committee appointed--I was authorized to appoint the committee--was Mr. Hopkins, chairman; Miss Perkins, Mr. Morgenthau, Mr. Walker, and Admiral Leahy. And that was the substance of the meeting. Now, I am going to have a press conference tomorrow, and I will let you ask me all the questions you want then.
Reporter: Mr. President, it is going to be very pleasant to have you at the Byron Price dinner tomorrow night, at the Press Club.
THE PRESIDENT. Isn't that Saturday?
Reporter: No, tomorrow, Thursday.
THE PRESIDENT. I'll be there; but you must be careful of me. [Laughter]
Note: President Truman's twenty-third news conference was held in his office at the White House at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, September 5, 1945.
