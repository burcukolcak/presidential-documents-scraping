Executive Order 9999â€”Suspending Certain Statutory Provisions Relating to Employment in the Canal Zone
By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Civil Functions Appropriation Act, 1949 (Public Law 782, 80th Congress), section 103 of the Department of the Navy Appropriations Act, 1949 (Public Law 753, 80th Congress), and section 4 of the Military Functions Appropriation Act, 1949 (Public Law 766, 80th Congress), relating to certain kinds of employment in the Canal Zone, and deeming such course to be in the public interest, I hereby suspend, from and including the effective dates of the said Acts, compliance with the provisions of the said sections during the continuance of the present national emergency.
Finding such action necessary because of a shortage of housing, I hereby suspend for the fiscal year 1949 the application of those portions of the cited sections of the respective Acts which require employment of citizens of the Republic of Panama or of the United States in skilled, technical clerical, administrative, executive, or supervisory positions.
