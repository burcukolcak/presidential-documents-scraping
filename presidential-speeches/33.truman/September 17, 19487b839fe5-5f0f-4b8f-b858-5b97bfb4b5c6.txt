Letter to Premier de Gasperi on Italian Participation in the European Recovery Program.
[Released September 17, 1948. Dated September 16, 1948]
Dear Mr. President:
Thank you for the letter you wrote to me after signing the Economic Cooperation Agreement.
Men everywhere participate in and contribute more effectively to an undertaking when the terms and purposes are clearly understood and the commitments are freely undertaken. The great amount of discussion in our respective countries and the large consensus in favor of the Agreement augurs well for its success.
The American people support this program wholeheartedly both for humanitarian and for practical reasons. In a world growing smaller day by day, no nation can profit by isolating itself. Mutual dependence means that your welfare affects our welfare and vice versa. Therefore, for our sake, for your sake, and for the sake of all other like-minded countries, it is our hope that the program in Italy and elsewhere will be crowned with success.
I express my admiration for the will to work shown by the Italian people in their most difficult moments. I admire also the sense of moderation and political maturity shown by your people who have regained so recently the privileges and responsibilities inherent in a liberal democracy.
I am certain that with the broad participation in the Recovery Program of all elements in the Italian nation, with your demonstrated will to work, and with your political maturity, Italy will play a significant constructive part in the European Recovery Program.

With cordial greetings, I am

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Alcide de Gasperi, President, Council of Ministers, Rome]
