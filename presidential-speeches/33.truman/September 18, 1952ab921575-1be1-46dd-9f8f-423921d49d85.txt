Statement by the President on the Death of Joseph Short.
JOE SHORT's death is as shocking to me as if he had been a member of my own family.
For he was more than a trusted and valued assistant. I know how unsparing of his health he was in his service to me and to his country. Despite every urging that he rest, he labored day and night for uncompromising principles. He was a tireless advocate of justice and decency, and an unflagging fighter for progressive programs to make his country stronger and sounder.

In his personal relationships, he was a devoted husband and father and held the respect and friendship of all who knew him.
Here was a public servant to inspire others, a rare model which cannot be replaced.
To the millions of Americans to whom Joe Short was only a name, I say all of us have lost grievously. Joe Short was my loyal friend.
Note: Mr. Short served as Secretary to the President from December 18, 1950, through September 18, 1952.
