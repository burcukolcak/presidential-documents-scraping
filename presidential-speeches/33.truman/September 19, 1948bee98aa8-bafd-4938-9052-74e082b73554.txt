Rear Platform Remarks in Kansas.
[1.] JUNCTION CITY, KANSAS (11:05 p.m.)
I have made a rule not to make political speeches on Sunday--never did from the time I was in politics 30 years ago. But I have been a steady visitor here for years and years and years. I came here to Fort Riley to train as a field artilleryman. Sometimes they tried to make a cavalryman out of me, but they didn't succeed.
I have been over this reservation from one end to the other. You know, it is a peculiar thing about this reservation. The geographical center of the United States is on this reservation, and the monument for it was moved by the authorities so the people could see it. So you have the distinction of having moved the center of the United States a quarter of a mile so people could look at it. No community in the country has been able to move the center of the United States, or any other center, for that matter. But you did.
I hope that the time will come when I can come back here and go over some of the pleasant things I have done here in times past.
It has been a pleasure to me to be associated with your good Kansas candidates this evening. I have had some very pleasant talks with them. They are all fine men. I know them personally, and I know that they will do you a good job, if you decide to give them the job to do.
Thank you very much.
