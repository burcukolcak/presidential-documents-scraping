CITATION FOR DISTINGUISHED SERVICE MEDAL
AS SECRETARY OF WAR from the beginning of the actual mobilization of the Army to the final victory over Japan, Henry Lewis Stimson gave the United States of America a measure of distinguished service exceptional in the history of the nation.
Following 40 years of conspicuous public service in which he fought as a combat officer in one war and twice served in the cabinets of Presidents, Mr. Stimson unhesitatingly accepted the vast responsibility for the development of the American armies to play a determining part in the desperate human conflict now victoriously terminated.
His fearlessness, his integrity, his rich experience, his wisdom and his statesmanship were largely contributory to the successful mobilization, deployment and operations of an Army in which his countrymen may take everlasting pride. His steadfast purpose and unselfish devotion were an inspiration to men-at-arms in American forces throughout the world in their bitter fight to maintain moral right, freedom, justice

and civilization itself.
