Statement by the President Concerning the National Wage Stabilization Board.
THE NATIONAL Wage Stabilization Board will continue to administer the wage stabilization program.
I asked the Advisory Board of OWMR this week to add to its agenda a study of the wage stabilization program. This Board has been studying problems of Government expenditures, the shortage of certain materials, and the over-all inflationary problem. The Advisory Board will, of course, consult in detail with the Wage Stabilization Board on this new topic as it has been doing from time to time in the past. The Advisory Board, as the name implies, is not an administrative agency. It was established by the Congress to advise the President and the Director of OWMR on broad problems of national reconversion policy.
Note: The National Wage Stabilization Board had recently reaffirmed a decision denying a wage increase to seamen, and the latter had called a strike in protest against the agency's ruling. As reported in the New York Times on September 13 William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, had termed the Board's attitude "dictatorial" and had predicted the resignation of several members.
