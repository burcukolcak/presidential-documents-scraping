Letter to the Vice President Transmitting Correspondence From Henry A. Wallace Relating to His Trip to the Far East in 1944.
[Released September 23, 1951 Dated September 22, 1951]
Dear Mr. Vice President:
I am sending you a copy of a letter, together with certain documents, which I recently received from Mr. Henry A. Wallace.
These papers deal with the facts of Mr. Wallace's trip to the Far East in 1944, and the part played by his advisers on that trip. These papers deal with certain matters which may be of interest to the Senate and its Committees. I am therefore making Mr. Wallace's letter available to you for use in such ways as you deem appropriate.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Honorable, The Vice President of the United States, Washington, D.C.]
