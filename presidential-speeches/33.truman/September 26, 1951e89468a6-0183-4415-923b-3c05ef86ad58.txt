Remarks to a Group of Korean Soldiers.
WE ARE glad to welcome you. I hope you have an enjoyable visit, and that you will go back with information that will be helpful to you and to your country, to make a contribution to the victory that we expect to win in Korea.

It is a pleasure to have you here.
Note: The President spoke at 3:05 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. The six officers of the Korean army were part of a group of 250 Korean soldiers who were brought to the United States to attend U.S. Army training schools.
