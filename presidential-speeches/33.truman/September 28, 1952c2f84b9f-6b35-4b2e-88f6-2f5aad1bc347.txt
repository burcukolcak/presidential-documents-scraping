Statement by the President on the Death of David K. Niles.
IN THE DEATH of David K. Niles early this morning I have lost a close friend and a trusted associate.
He served two Presidents of the United States in positions of the highest trust and confidence. Presidents have been served by many able men, but seldom by one so truly selfless. His passion for anonymity was matched only by his sense of public responsibility. David Niles' quick mind and warm heart were always in the service of humanity.
One of his greatest wishes, unfortunately, was denied him. He had wished to visit Israel, whose birth and future development were close to his heart. In the work he did for displaced persons, untold numbers of people, many of whom may never know his name, have found a chance to live again in dignity. We are closer to our American dream of equal rights and opportunity because of programs he initiated.
I have lost a valued assistant. The under privileged people of the world have lost a great and steadfast friend.
Note: Mr. Niles served as Administrative Assistant to the President from August 1, 1942, through May 31, 1951.
