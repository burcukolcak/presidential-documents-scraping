Letter to the Vice President on the Need for Repatriating Displaced Greek Children.
Dear Mr. Vice President:
I know that all Americans share the Senate's humanitarian concern for the thousands of Greek children removed from Greece during the guerrilla warfare and now being held in eastern Europe. Freedom-loving people throughout the world are repelled by the inhumanity embodied in the unjustified retention of these innocent children far from their parents and their native land.
The Executive Branch has exerted and will continue to exert every feasible effort to encourage the repatriation of these children. I am certain that the United Nations has been encouraged in its efforts to effect the children's return by the Senate's deep and sympathetic concern as expressed in S. Res. 212 on September 13, 1950.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Albert W. Barkley, Vice President of the United States, Washington, D.C.]
