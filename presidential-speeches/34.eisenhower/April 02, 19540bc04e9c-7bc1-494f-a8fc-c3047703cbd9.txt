Statement by the President on the Death of General Hoyt S. Vandenberg.
THE NATION mourns the passing of a devoted and able military leader, General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, and will hold him in grateful remembrance.
Gallant commander, a decade ago, of our tactical air force in Northwest Europe; unswerving advocate of the precepts and cause of the United States Air Force; a forceful fighter for a strong national defense-General Vandenberg was a courageous and tireless leader. He has left a lasting imprint on the Service he loved so well and on the nation he served with all his strength and skill.
News of his untimely death brings sorrow to his host of civilian and military friends, among whom I was privileged to be numbered.
