President of Mexico
I am deeply grateful for the kind message which you so thoughtfully sent me on your return to Mexico City from White Sulphur Springs. It was a source of great satisfaction to me that you and the Prime Minister of Canada found it possible to join me in our recent informal meeting and that you gave me the opportunity to renew our personal friendship. I feel sure that such contact will further strengthen the friendly ties which have so long and happily been maintained through the usual diplomatic interchange.
In extending my every wish for your continued well-being, I renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my personal consideration and highest esteem.
