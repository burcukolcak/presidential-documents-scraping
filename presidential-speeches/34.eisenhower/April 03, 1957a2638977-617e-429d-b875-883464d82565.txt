Statement by the President on the Death of Rowland R. Hughes.
I HAVE JUST HEARD the tragic news of the passing of Rowland R. Hughes. A former Director of the Budget and an old and dear friend, Mr. Hughes served the Administration and his Country with distinction and integrity, contributing greatly to the welfare of our nation. Mrs. Eisenhower and I join with his many friends in extending our deepest sympathy to his family.
