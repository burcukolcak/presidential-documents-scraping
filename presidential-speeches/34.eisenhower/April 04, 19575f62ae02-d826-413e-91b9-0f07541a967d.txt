[Released April 4, 1957. Dated April 2, 1957]
THE PRESIDENT of the United States takes pride in presenting the National Security Medal to
MAJOR GENERAL WILLIAM J. DONOVAN, AUS (RET)
for service as set forth in the following
CITATION:
Through his foresight, wisdom, and experience, he foresaw, during the course of World War II, the problems which would face the postwar world and the urgent need for a permanent, centralized intelligence function. Thus his wartime work contributed to the establishment of the Central Intelligence Agency and a coordinated national intelligence structure. Since the creation of the Agency, he has given to it generously of his experience, making through the postwar years a valuable contribution to the field of intelligence relating to the national security. In 1953 and 1954, as Ambassador of the United States to Thailand, he served in this important diplomatic post with the same tireless energy and skill he had shown in his wartime service. Both in public and private life he has made outstanding contributions to the security and defense of his country.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The National Security Medal was transmitted to New York City where it was presented to General Donovan. At General Donovan's request no presentation ceremony was held.
