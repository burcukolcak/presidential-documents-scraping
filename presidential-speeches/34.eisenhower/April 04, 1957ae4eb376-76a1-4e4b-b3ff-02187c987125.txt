Statement by the President on the Eighth Anniversary of the Signing of the North Atlantic Treaty.
TODAY is the eighth anniversary of the signing on April 4, 1949, here in Washington of the North Atlantic Treaty.
Since the inception of NATO, the member countries, by dedicated cooperative effort, have developed a strong defensive shield which has been a major factor in maintaining the peace in Europe.
The cooperative efforts of the NATO nations have now been extended beyond the field of military activity. The feeling has steadily grown among the governments and people of the NATO countries that increased unity among them is both natural and desirable. In the face of an unchanging challenge to their traditions and indeed their very freedom, they have agreed to work together on an ever-widening range of problems. Thus, the Atlantic Community will continue to grow in unity and in strength. Personally and officially I shall do everything in my power to assist in this further development.
