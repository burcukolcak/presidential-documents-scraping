Statement by the President on the Fifth Anniversary of the Announcement of the Effectiveness of Polio Vaccine.
APRIL 12, 1960, marks the fifth anniversary of an auspicious day for American parents--the announcement of the effectiveness of a vaccine against poliomyelitis.
In the intervening years, polio has been dealt a heavy blow but it has not been destroyed. The reason is clear; not enough Americans have had the full course of injections that are needed for the maximum protection afforded by the vaccine against polio.
Many people are needlessly risking death or lifetime handicap simply because they have failed to take advantage of one of medicine's great achievements.
To those who are still unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated, I urge renewed effort on this anniversary occasion. Make April 12 a new kind of V-Day--vaccination day--by calling your physician or health department to arrange for the polio shots you or your family need. Children under five years of age particularly need this protection.
