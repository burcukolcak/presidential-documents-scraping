Remarks to the Easter Egg Rollers on the White House Lawn.
My friends:
It is a privilege to welcome you once more to the annual egg-rolling contest on the White House grounds. I surely hope that the weather cooperates with you properly and that you do not have the discomfort of a shower.
Moreover, I just learned this morning that many of the schoolchildren had to go to school on this Easter Monday and so to them I extend my sympathies for missing the fun of the day that I hope the rest of you will have.

Mrs. Eisenhower joins me in saying Happy Easter to all of you. Goodbye.
