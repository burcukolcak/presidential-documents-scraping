Message to President Carlos P. Garcia of the Philippines on Bataan Day.
Dear Mr. President:
On this 16th Anniversary of the fall of Bataan, an event which we commemorate with sadness, but with pride, I extend best wishes to you and to the people of the Philippines on behalf of the people of the United States.
The symbol of Bataan, the offering of the ultimate sacrifice by friends for one another, is an ideal so tardy witnessed that it will inspire freedom-loving men always. That together we have carried on our struggle for the preservation of liberty with justice does honor to the memory of our fallen sons and comrades.
Our mutual friendship has been nourished by the spirit of Bataan. May it continue to grow.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
