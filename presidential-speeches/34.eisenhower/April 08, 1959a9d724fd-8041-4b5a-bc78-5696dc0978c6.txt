Message to President Garcia of the Philippines on Bataan Day.
[Released April 8, 1959. Dated April 7, 1959]
ON THE seventeenth Anniversary of Bataan, a campaign of heroic memory, I extend best wishes to you and to the people of the Philippines on behalf of the people of the United States.
The bonds of brotherhood forged in the gallant defense of Bataan and Corregidor are part of the tradition which unites our two countries. Our continuing effort to defend and encourage the growth of democratic institutions throughout the world is a corollary of this tradition. In this campaign, we will together press on to win the victory: Peace with honor and progress for mankind.
It is a privilege to join you in commemorating the indomitable spirit of Bataan.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
