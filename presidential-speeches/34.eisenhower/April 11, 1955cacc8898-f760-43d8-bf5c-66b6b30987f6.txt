Remarks to the Easter Egg Rollers on the South Grounds of the White House.
GOOD MORNING, folks.
I didn't come out here to make you a talk. I came out to welcome you to the White House grounds, to congratulate you on the weather you are having for the egg-rolling, and to hope that every youngster here has a wonderful time, and nobody gets lost.
Last year there were quite a number lost, but we found out it wasn't the children that were lost at all; it was just the parents.
This time I hope that everything will work out so that you can all stay together and have a wonderful time.
Mrs. Eisenhower is sorry she couldn't be here to say "Welcome," but I assure you that she feels that way.

So have a good time, and I hope it doesn't rain today. Goodbye. Thank you very much.
