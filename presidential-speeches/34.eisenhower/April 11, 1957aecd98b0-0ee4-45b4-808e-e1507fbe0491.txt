Special Message to the Congress Transmitting Interim Report of Edward P. Curtis, Special Assistant for Aviation Facilities Planning.
To the Congress of the United States:
Widespread attention has been drawn to the need for vigorous action to advance the safety and convenience of the public and military agencies engaged in air travel and air operations. On March 1, 1956, I appointed a Special Assistant for Aviation Facilities Planning, and directed him to develop comprehensive proposals for meeting the Nation's needs for air traffic control and air navigation facilities.
I transmit herewith an interim report prepared by my Special Assistant for Aviation Facilities Planning. This report sets forth the gravity of our present and anticipated air traffic problems. It also proposes the establishment of an Airways Modernization Board and explains the manner in which it will function.
The Director of the Bureau of the Budget is transmitting to the Congress draft legislation to establish the Airways Modernization Board. This measure will greatly expedite the improvement of air traffic control and air navigation and I therefore urge its early enactment.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
