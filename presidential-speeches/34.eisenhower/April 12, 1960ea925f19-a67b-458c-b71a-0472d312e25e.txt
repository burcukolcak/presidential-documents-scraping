Letter to the Co-Chairmen of the Joint Federal-State Action Committee on Receiving the Committee's Final Report.
[ Released April 12, 1960. Dated April 9, 1960 ]
Dear :
This acknowledges the receipt of the report of the Joint Federal-State Action Committee, submitted on April 7, 1960. I believe that continuation of the Committee alongside the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations would be duplication of effort. The Committee has worked well and earnestly toward the strengthening of our governmental system. It is my hope and expectation that the Advisory Commission will further the Committee's work and broaden its scope for the same purpose--to make our federal system an even more effective instrument to serve the American people.
In dissolving the Joint Federal-State Action Committee, I extend my thanks to the members, both the Governors and Federal officials, and to the joint staffs, for their work and interest in this project.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
