Remarks Following Announcement of the Vice President's Visit to Moscow To Open the American National Exhibition.
I AM PLEASED that the Vice President will be able to go to Moscow and represent the American people. These exhibitions are designed to achieve a broader understanding between our two peoples--the kind of mutual understanding upon which our peaceful future depends. It is a hopeful approach. We welcome it wholeheartedly.
Note: This statement, released at Augusta, Ga., was part of a White House announcement relating to the exchange of exhibitions with the Soviet Union. The release stated that the Vice President would open the American National Exhibition in Sokolniki Park, Moscow, on July 25. It also noted that the exhibition was being held in accordance with the December 29, 1958, agreement with the Soviet Union for exhibits to be held in New York and Moscow during the summer of 1959 (see Department of State Bulletin, vol. 40, p. 132).
Later, on May 21, the White House released the names of 51 leaders in the fields of industry, science, education, and the arts who had been appointed to serve as a citizen advisory committee for the American National Exhibition. The release noted that the group had met with the President at the White House on January 23 to discuss preliminary plans for the exhibition, and that individual members had been assisting George V. Allen, governmental coordinator of the exhibition, and Harold C. McClellan, its general manager.
