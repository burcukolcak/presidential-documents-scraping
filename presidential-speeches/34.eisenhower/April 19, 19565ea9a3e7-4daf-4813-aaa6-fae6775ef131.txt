Letter Commemorating the 75th Anniversary of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.
To the United Brotherhood of

Carpenters and Joiners of America:
As the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners marks its Diamond Jubilee Year, I salute this international trade union for its contributions to the welfare of its vast membership, to the American free enterprise system, and to our free labor movement.
Such unions have done much to promote a rising standard of living for American wage earners and thus. to further the economic and social progress of the Nation. By inspiring pride in craftsmanship among those in the skilled trades, by fostering apprenticeship training programs to help the Nation replenish its supply of skilled workers, and by helping to keep our production lines competently manned in war and peace, the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners has contributed greatly to our country's security and growth.
This contribution is due in large part to the Brotherhood's outstanding leaders--such men as William Hutcheson--leaders who, over the years, have been a credit to their Union and to the entire Nation.
I wish all of you a happy Seventy-fifth Anniversary and continued success in the years to come.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The President handed this letter to Maurice A. Hutcheson, President of the Brotherhood, at a meeting in the President's office.
