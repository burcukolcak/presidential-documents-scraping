Letter to the Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Concerning the St. Lawrence Seaway.
[Released April 24, 1953. Dated April 23, 1953]
- Dear Senator Wiley:
At my request, the National Security Council has considered the national security interests in the Saint Lawrence-Great Lakes Seaway Project. The Council has advised me:
1. Early initiation and completion of the Saint Lawrence-Great Lakes Seaway is in the interest of national security.
2. The United States should promptly take whatever action may be appropriate to clear the way for commencement of the project, whether by Canada alone, or, now or as may be later developed, by Canada and the United States jointly.
3. It is desirable that the United States participate in the construction of the Seaway; the extent of and limitations upon such participation to be the subject of separate determination by authority other than the Council.
The Council's findings and recommendations have my approval; and I propose now to discuss with the Cabinet the extent of and limitations upon United States participation in the project.
I am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Chairman of the Federal Power Commission for his information and such action as he may deem appropriate.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
The Honorable Alexander Wiley

Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations

United States Senate

Washington, D.C.
