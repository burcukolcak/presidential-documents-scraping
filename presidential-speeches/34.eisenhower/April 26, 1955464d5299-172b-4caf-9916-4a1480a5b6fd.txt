Letter to Harvey S. Firestone, Jr., Upon Accepting Honorary Chairmanship of the United Service Organizations.
Dear Mr. Firestone:
I have accepted the honorary chairmanship of the USO because I know what a great contribution it has made, and is still making, to the well-being of the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces.
More than just a Camp Show or a chance for an hour's diversion, more than just relaxation or warm hospitality, the USO means to the men and women in the Armed Services that they have a host of friends in the homes of America. No matter what part of the country a serviceman comes from, no matter what his race or religion, he wants to feel confident that what he is doing is important to other human beings, and that they are grateful for it.
Such assurance fortifies spirit and morale, strengthens the ties in heart and mind which unite the individual serviceman with his fellow citizens, which make him feel that he is part of America! He must have such assurance, if he is willingly and ably to perform the vitally important duties which our times and our nation's good demand of him.
For these reasons the work of the USO must go forward. The continued support of our people through united community campaigns will assure that it will go forward.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Following his acceptance of the honorary chairmanship from a delegation from the United Service Organizations, the President handed this letter to Mr. Firestone, Chairman of the Board. The group met with the President in his office at 11:30 a.m.
