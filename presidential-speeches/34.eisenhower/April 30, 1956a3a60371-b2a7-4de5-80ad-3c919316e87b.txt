Dwight D. Eisenhower
April 30, 1956

Statement by the President on the Death of Alben W. Barkley.
I WAS SHOCKED to learn the news of the sudden death of Senator Alben W. Barkley. As Vice President of the United States, Member of Congress and Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Barkley had a long and distinguished record of public service for the people of his state and country. The nation is the poorer by this tragic event. Mrs. Eisenhower and I join with all other Americans in extending our heartfelt sympathy to his family.
