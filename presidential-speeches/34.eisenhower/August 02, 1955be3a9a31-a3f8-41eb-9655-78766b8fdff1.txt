Dwight D. Eisenhower

Statement by the President Upon Signing the Mutual Security Appropriation Act.
I HAVE TODAY approved H.R. 7224, the Mutual Security Appropriation Act, 1956, which appropriates $2,765,875,000 for further carrying out the Mutual Security Act of 1954.
There are several provisions in the Act relating to Direct forces support and Defense support where particular countries are named as eligible recipients of assistance in specified amounts. I regard these provisions as authorizations, and also as limitations on the availability of the amounts specified, rather than as directives. To construe them otherwise would raise substantial Constitutional questions.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 7224 is Public Law 208, 84th Congress (69 Stat. 435).
