Statement by the President Upon Signing the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954.
THIS LAW is especially noteworthy in two respects. In the first place, it reemphasizes to all the world the great value which we, in America, place upon the dignity and worth of each individual human being. Second, it is a humanitarian investment of great importance, yet it saves substantial sums of money for both Federal and State governments.
The law lays a foundation for increasing from 60,000 to 900,000 by 1959 the number of disabled people rehabilitated each year. Each State is given more assistance for its rehabilitation program but is enabled to assume more responsibility in the program's administration and operation. The law also provides for special training for rehabilitation specialists, increased research on conditions that result in handicaps, and new benefits for the blind.
A few weeks ago, I approved another law in the four-point health program which we placed before the Congress this year. It will provide hospitals and nursing homes for people with long-term illnesses, and special medical facilities for persons who do not need hospitalization but do need medical attention. It also will provide rehabilitation facilities to serve many thousands of additional disabled people each year.
Our people have no personal concern more important than the maintenance of good health. I am delighted, therefore, that the Congress has passed this important new law to help more of our people meet their essential health needs.
Note: The act (Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954) is Public Law 565, 83d Congress (68 Stat. 652).
