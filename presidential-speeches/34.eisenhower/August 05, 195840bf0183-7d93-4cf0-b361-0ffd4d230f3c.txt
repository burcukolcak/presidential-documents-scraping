Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting Report on Airline Equipment Investment Program.
Dear___________:
I am enclosing for the information of the appropriate Committees of the Senate (House of Representatives) a report which was recently prepared for my Special Assistant, Mr. E. R. Quesada, concerning the status and economic significance of the current equipment investment program of the major air carriers which, in turn, affects the broader aviation industry. This report sets forth, in some detail, the present status of the major air carriers and discusses their ability to implement their investment program of approximately $4 billion by 1962 in aircraft and equipment. This program is of such a size as to hold some significance to the national economy over the next few years.
I am today also transmitting the report to the appropriate agencies of government for their information and such action as they may deem appropriate within the framework of existing authority.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: This is the text of identical letters addressed to the Honorable Richard M. Nixon, President of the Senate, and the Honorable Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House of Representatives.
