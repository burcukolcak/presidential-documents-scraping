Letter to Herbert Hoover, Jr., on His Contribution to the Settlement of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Dispute.
[Released August 7, 1954. Dated August 4, 1954]
Dear Herbert:
I want to express again my deep appreciation of your outstanding contribution to a realistic and equitable settlement of the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute which has so long been a threat to the stability of the Middle East.
My appreciation of the contribution you have made is enhanced by the fact that I have known something of the personal sacrifice you have made in order to assist us. I have in fact felt concerned, as the many months involved went by, by knowing that your absence from your own business affairs was extending far longer than we had originally planned. The fact that you chose, without urging, to stay with the problem until its solution, has been a great source of satisfaction to me and to members of the Cabinet.
The conclusion of this agreement, which promises to further progress in Iran as well as our objective of maintaining peace in the area, is due in significant measure to your expert knowledge of the international oil business, to your persistence and to your skillful diplomacy.

I am personally grateful to you.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Hoover served as Consultant to the Secretary of State on international oil matters. The letter was released at Augusta, Ca.
