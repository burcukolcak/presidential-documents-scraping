Letter to the Governors of the States Urging Them To Establish Committees To Assist in Implementing the Refugee Relief Act
Dear Governor:
With America's traditional concern for the homeless, the persecuted, and the less fortunate of other lands . . . one of the first acts passed by your 83rd Congress was the Refugee Relief Act of 1953 authorizing the entry into the United States of some 214,000 refugees.
These are men and women of the same character and integrity as their and our ancestors who, generation upon generation, have come to America to find peace and work, to build for themselves new homes in freedom.
Under supervision of the Department of State an almost world-wide organization has been set up to help these refugees from Communist persecution, natural disaster, and military operations. To aid in obtaining the needed sponsorship-assurances for these people, and to assist in the resettlement program, we need your assistance.
It would greatly stimulate the speed and effectiveness of this program if you would consider appointing a Governor's Committee to operate within your state. So that you can give full consideration to our suggestion, I am asking the State Department to forward you a complete Committee Manual explaining the act, functions of the Governor's Committee and other pertinent information.
Your assistance in this great humanitarian program will always be a source of great personal satisfaction and will be a genuine service to many communities within your state.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
