Statement by the President Upon Signing the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956.
I HAVE SIGNED S. 3275, the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956â€¢ In signing this bill, I do not regard as a directive the provisions of section 8 which relate to United States representation at international conferences and negotiations concerning fish and wildlife matters. If they were to be so construed they would, in my judgment, be unconstitutional as limitations on the authority of the President of the United States to conduct negotiations with other governments through agents designated by him or at his direction. Accordingly, I regard these provisions as merely an indication of the desire of the Congress that the resources of the Interior Department be utilized in the formulation of United States policies affecting fish and wildlife matters, which of course I fully share and which is and has been my policy.
Note: As enacted, S. 3275 is Public Law 1024, 84th Congress (70 Stat. 1119).
