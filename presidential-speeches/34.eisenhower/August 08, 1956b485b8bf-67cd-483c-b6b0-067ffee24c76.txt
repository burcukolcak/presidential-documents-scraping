Statement by the President Upon Signing the American Samoa Labor Standards Amendments of 1956.
I HAVE TODAY signed S. 3956, the "American Samoa Labor Standards Amendments of 1956" because I am convinced that some adjustment of the existing provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to the Samoan economy is needed.
The bill is, however, defective in the manner in which it provides for the fixing of minimum wages. Under the bill, minimum wages are to be set by industry committees, representing the affected groups, without any review by the Government officials responsible for the administration of the statute. Such provisions are unsound, and it is my earnest hope that the Congress at its next session will amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to provide for review by the Secretary of Labor of determinations of industry committees.
Note: As enacted, S. 3956 is Public Law 1023, 84th Congress (70 Stat. 1118).
