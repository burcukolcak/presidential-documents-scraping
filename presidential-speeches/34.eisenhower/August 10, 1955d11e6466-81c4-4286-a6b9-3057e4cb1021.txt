Statement by the President Upon Signing H.R. 7684 Authorizing Salary Payment to an Interim Appointee to the Atomic Energy Commission.
I SIGN this measure because of the necessity of its first section which permits payment of salary to an interim appointee to fill the existing vacancy on the Atomic Energy Commission.
The second section is an unnecessary piece of legislation and irrelevant to the first section. I have previously expressed my views on this method of legislating and will not repeat them here. The purpose of the second section is stated to be to give all Commissioners equal access to information necessary in the performance of their duties as Commissioners. Existing law fully accomplishes this with its provisions for equal responsibility and equal authority for each member of the Commission. Most Commissioners have previously indicated their belief that the existing law is adequate and clear. The Chairman of the Commission has nevertheless recommended that I sign the bill and I accordingly do so.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 7684 is Public Law 337, 84th Congress (69 Stat. 630).
