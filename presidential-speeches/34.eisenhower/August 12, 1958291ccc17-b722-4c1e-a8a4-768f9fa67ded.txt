Veto of Bill Authorizing Construction of a Nuclear-Powered Icebreaking Vessel.
To the House of Representatives:
I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 9196, "To authorize the construction of a nuclear-powered icebreaking vessel for operation by the United States Coast Guard, and for other purposes."
The estimated cost of a nuclear-powered ice breaker is $60 million. I cannot approve expending $60 million for the construction of such an ice breaker at this time. Neither the Navy nor the Coast Guard construction program includes any ice breakers, and placing the construction of an ice breaker arbitrarily ahead of high priority projects in the Coast Guard program would be most unwise.
Nor can the construction of a nuclear-powered ice breaker be justified as an extension of the present program of developing nuclear power for vessels. In addition to the types of atomic reactors now in service in operating submarines, we are developing advanced types for other naval vessels. We are also constructing a nuclear-powered merchant ship. No valid reason exists for increasing this extensive program at this time.
This bill, in providing for a project which is not needed, fails to take account of the present fiscal situation of the Government. A continued disregard of our budgetary problems through the institution of unneeded new programs and projects can only add to inflationary pressures to the detriment of all the people.
