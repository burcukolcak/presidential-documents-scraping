Statement by the President Following the Adoption by the House of Representatives of the Landrum-Griffin Labor Reform Bill
WITH, I am sure, millions of Americans I applaud the House of Representatives for its vote today in support of the Landrum-Griffin Labor Reform Bill which would deal effectively with the abuses disclosed by the McClellan Committee. I congratulate all those who voted in support of this legislation.
This action gives cause for real hope that the Congress will ultimately pass a good Labor Reform Bill.
Note: This statement was released at Gettysburg, Pa. The President approved the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (Public Law 86-257, 73 Stat. 519) on September 14, 1959.
