I greatly appreciate your most cordial message on the successful voyage of the Nautilus. Our sincere hope is that this voyage will have opened a new avenue for world trade and communication which will serve to promote not only the closer association of the nations of the world, but also the well-being of then' peoples. The congratulations of the Italian people whose captains of the sea figured so prominently in the discovery of America are particularly gratifying.

With the bold undertaking of the Nautilus which takes its place in the glorious tradition of the greatest sea voyages of all time, the American Navy has opened a new path for mankind. The fact that it has been opened by free and democratic America constitutes a guarantee that it will be dedicated to the progress of humanity and the peaceful bringing together of the peoples of the world.
