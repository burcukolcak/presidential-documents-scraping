[ Released August 18, 1958. Dated August 15, 1958 ]
To Her Majesty Elizabeth Queen of Great Britain:
In August 1858 President Buchanan exchanged greetings with Queen Victoria by means of the newly completed Atlantic cable. Commemorating that happy occasion, it is a pleasure to send best wishes to you on the one hundredth anniversary of the completion of the first Trans-Atlantic Cable.
The development of international communications has brought the peoples of the world into close neighborhood. It is our hope that these means of communication will serve increasingly as a carrier of the message of peace for which we both work and pray.

With personal greetings to you and to your family.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

The President
The White House
I am glad of the opportunity afforded by the centenary of the completion of the first Trans-Atlantic Cable to send you my warm good wishes. The cable which joins our coasts is a symbol of the links between our two countries. I believe that closer communications not only between our peoples but amongst all lands must contribute towards greater mutual understanding and the cause of peace which lies so near to all our hearts.
ELIZABETH R.
