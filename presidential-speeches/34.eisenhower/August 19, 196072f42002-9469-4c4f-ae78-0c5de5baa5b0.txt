Letter Accepting Resignation of Henry Cabot Lodge as U.S. Representative to the United Nations.
Dear Cabot:
In the past seven and a half years the United Nations has indeed, as you say, grown greatly in influence and as an agency for the preservation of peace. This has not been so because of any one nation or any one man. But the United States has sought to nurture that growth. As her Representative you have applied extraordinary talents of firmness, perseverance, and imagination to pressing in that forum our aims of peace with freedom and justice.
For your services in this cause and to the United States you have, I am sure, the gratitude of all the American people--especially, perhaps, groups of our citizens most recently of foreign origin. In behalf of all Americans and for my own part, I thank you.
I accept your resignation as the Representative of the United States to the United Nations and to the Security Council, effective, as you wish, September third. The deep regret I feel at contemplating your leaving your United Nations post is mitigated by the knowledge that you do so only to offer yourself to the nation in an elective post of high responsibility and opportunity for service. In this effort you have, as you know, my heartiest endorsement. The country could ill afford in these times to lose the service of a man of your abilities.
With warm regard,

As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Lodge became Representative of the United States to the United Nations on January 23, 1953. His letter of resignation, dated August 17, was released with the President's reply.
