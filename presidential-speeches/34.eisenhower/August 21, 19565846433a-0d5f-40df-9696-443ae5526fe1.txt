Dwight D. Eisenhower
August 21, 1956

Remarks on Arrival at San Francisco for the Republican National Convention.
Governor Knight, Mrs. Knight, ladies and gentlemen:
It is wonderful to be back in your great State.
A few days ago I was reading the paper and I suddenly decided this was too interesting a place to stay away from until Wednesday night. So I induced my family to change their plans so that I could get here twenty-four hours earlier. I just read the names of too many friends in the papers and I wanted to see them. And I hope I find some of those friends among you.
Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at the International Airport at 7:00 p.m. in response to words of greeting by Governor Goodwin J. Knight.
