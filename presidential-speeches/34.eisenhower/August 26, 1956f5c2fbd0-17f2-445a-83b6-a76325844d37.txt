Statement by the President Concerning Resumption of Nuclear Tests by the U. S. S. R.
I WISH AGAIN to emphasize the necessity for effective international control of atomic energy and such measures of adequately safeguarded disarmament as are now feasible. This is a goal which the United States has consistently sought and which has received the support of a large majority of the members of the United Nations.
Note: The President's statement was part of a White House release to which was attached a statement by Lewis L. Strauss, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission. The release added that Mr. Strauss' statement was being made public in accordance with the President's policy of keeping the American people informed to the fullest practical extent of important developments at home and abroad concerning nuclear weapons.
In his statement Mr. Strauss noted that the Soviet Union had resumed its testing of nuclear weapons and had detonated a nuclear device on August 24, 1956â€¢ He added that the Soviet Union had never given the world any assurances with respect to the way in which it conducts nuclear weapons tests and had never given advance notice of any of its detonations or test series.
The full text of Mr. Strauss' statement is published in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 35, P. 424). The President's statement was released at Cypress Point, Calif.
