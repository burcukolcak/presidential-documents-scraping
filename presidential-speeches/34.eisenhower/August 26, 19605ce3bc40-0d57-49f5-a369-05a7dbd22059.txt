Statement by the President on the 40th Anniversary of the Women's Suffrage Amendment.
FORTY YEARS AGO today, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States became effective. This Amendment gave the women of America the right to become full voting partners with the men of America.
In observing this anniversary, it is fitting to honor such women as Susan B. Anthony and Carrie Chapman Catt whose courageous work paved the way for the passage of the 19th Amendment. I would also like to pay tribute to the women of today who exercise their inherited voting rights with pride and judgment. Their lively political concern-at election time and whenever an issue of public moment arises in their communities--contributes greatly to the strength of our local, State and federal Governments. As they study the issues, work for their Party's candidates, and cast their responsible ballots at the polls, they illustrate to people the world over the privileges and fights of a free society, selecting by free choice the leaders who will represent them in the nation and the world.
