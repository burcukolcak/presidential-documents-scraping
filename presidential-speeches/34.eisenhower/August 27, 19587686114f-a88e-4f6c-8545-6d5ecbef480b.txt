Memorandum of Disapproval of Bill To Pay Relocation Costs of the Chamberlain Water Co.
I AM WITHHOLDING my approval from S. 228, which would authorize the payment of $3,116.40 to the Chamberlain Water Company, of Chamberlain, South Dakota. This sum would be paid to compensate the company for relocation costs occasioned by the Government's acquisition of its former location for use in connection with the fort Randall Dam and Reservoir project.
Public Law 500, approved July 3, 1958, makes provision for paying these removal expenses and the Secretary of the Army reports that the claim is now being processed. The present enactment, therefore, is unnecessary.
