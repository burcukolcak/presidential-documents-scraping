Dwight D. Eisenhower
August 28, 1958

Statement by the President on the Death of Dr. Ernest O. Lawrence.
I AM DEEPLY SHOCKED to hear of the sudden passing of Dr. Ernest O. Lawrence. Inventor of the cyclotron, Nobel Prize winner and Director of the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Dr. Lawrence devoted his brilliant talents to the service of his country and to mankind. His loss is a tragic one for the United States and for the entire free world. Mrs. Eisenhower and I join with all Americans and with the scientific community of the world in extending our heartfelt sympathies to his family.
