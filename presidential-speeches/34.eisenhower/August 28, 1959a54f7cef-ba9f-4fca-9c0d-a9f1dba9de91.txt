Message to Mayor Brandt of West Berlin.
[Released August 28, 1959. Dated August 27, 1959]
Dear Mayor Brandt:
I am grateful for your message of welcome.
As you know, the limited time available for my visits to Bonn, Paris, and London made it impossible for me to come to Berlin at this time. However, I should not want to let the occasion of my visit to Europe pass without conveying to you and to the stalwart people of Berlin my personal greetings and the expression of the admiration of the American people for the call and resolute attitude which your city has shown in the face of the difficulties of the past year. It is my hope that we shall be able, in the discussions foreseen for the coming months, to bring to an end the present period of tension over Berlin. If we continue to face our common problem with fortitude, patience, and imagination, we may realistically expect that such an objective will be achieved.
As I stated at the time of my arrival in the Federal Republic, the Western Powers stand firm in their determination to preserve the integrity of Berlin and to foster conditions which will eventually permit the German people to be reunited into one free nation.
With warm personal regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
