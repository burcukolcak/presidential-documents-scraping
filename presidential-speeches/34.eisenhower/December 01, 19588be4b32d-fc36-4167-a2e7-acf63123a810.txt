Letter to President Lopez Mateos of√ø Mexico.
Dear Mr. President:
I send you warmest greetings and felicitations upon your accession to the high office of the Presidency of the United Mexican States.

Our two countries share an extensive border. They present to the world a proud example of how frontiers can be used as gateways to promote the peaceful interchange of persons, culture and goods essential to our mutual welfare.
I am sure that the cordiality and warm regard which have been long evident between the Chiefs of State of the United Mexican States and the United States of America will long endure, as will the sincere affection which is manifest between our two peoples.
In transmitting to you my expressions of high esteem, I also assure you of my best wishes for your personal health and well-being, as well as happiness and success in your high office.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
