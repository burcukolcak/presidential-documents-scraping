Statement by the President Concerning Treaty Negotiations Between the United States and Japan.
DURING the past months, we have been negotiating a new treaty and other security arrangements with Japan. We attach the greatest importance to this new treaty with Japan which is bring negotiated between equals for the mutual benefit and enlightened self-interest of both countries and is therefore in keeping with the new era in our relations with Japan enunciated following my talks with Prime Minister Kishi here in Washington in June 1957. The timing of this new treaty with Japan is particularly opportune since I feel it is most essential at the present juncture in international affairs for the free world to maintain its unity and strength.
Since the negotiations are still in progress, I would prefer not to comment on the details of the new arrangements or the final plans for signing the treaty. However, I understand that Prime Minister Kishi is considering coming to Washington for the signing of the new treaty. If he decides to come, I will welcome the opportunity to talk with him again since he is one of the free world's staunchest leaders and heads a country whose friendship we value most highly.
