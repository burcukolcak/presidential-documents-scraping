Remarks at Esenboga Airport, Ankara, Upon Leaving for Pakistan.
Mr. President, Prime Minister Menderes, Members of the Government, Citizens of Turkey:
Through you, President Bayar, and your government, I should like to express to the Turkish people my very warm thanks for the extraordinary reception they accorded to my party and me as we went through Ankara yesterday.
I have been deeply touched. I take their demonstration as a symbol of the true affection that exists between the peoples of America and of Turkey.
For the second time I say goodbye to this country--both times realizing that the visit that I have made is far too short.
This country takes hold of my heart. I should like to stay here and mingle with the people a far longer time than my official duties will permit me to do. But I do assure you that I leave with the greatest expression of appreciation and affection.
Our two countries have been friends for a long time. I think that they have been growing stronger and firmer friends, every year, every month, every day. I am confident this will continue to be so..
We stand together on the major issues that divide the world. And I can see no reason whatsoever that we shouldn't be two of the sturdiest partners standing together always for freedom, security, and the pursuit of peace.
Permit me, as I say Godspeed, good luck to you, to again attempt another Turkish expression, this time: Allah'a ismarladik. [I commend you to Allah.]
Note: The President spoke at 9:45 a.m., following his arrival by helicopter from the Guest House in Ankara. He was accompanied to the airport by President Bayar. The farewell ceremonies were held in the airport building. A 21-gun salute was fired as President Eisenhower filed through lines of members of the diplomatic corps and Turkish government officials, shaking hands with each on his way across the ramp to his aircraft.
