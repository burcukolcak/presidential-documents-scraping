Toast to President Ayub Khan at a Dinner Given in His Honor by the President.
Ladies and gentlemen:
I am going to propose a toast to the President of Pakistan, but before doing so I want to assure the President and all his associates in government, whose guests my party and I have been for the past 2 days, that we have had not only an interesting and enjoyable time, but we sincerely believe an instructive time. We think we learned something about your country that will be helpful to us.
If we have done that, that is real reason we should have come.
In addition to that, I want to tell you that it has been a most happy experience for us. The hospitality, the cordiality and the warmth of the reception to all of us have meant a very great deal to each of us.
And so, my friends, I propose a toast to the President of Pakistan.
Note: The President proposed this toast at the dinner given at the residence of U.S. Ambassador William Rountree in Karachi at 9:40 p.m.
