Remarks at Mauripur Airport, Karachi, Upon Leaving for Afghanistan.
MR. PRESIDENT, the time has come for my party and me to say goodbye to you and your friendly country. We have found very interesting and constructive our talks with you and your government, and we hope that you have also received some value from them. Our stay has been all too brief. We have just had a sample of your country and should like to come again. Certainly we have seen enough to know that if we could come we could be sure of the kind of courtesy and hospitality that your country is famous for.
Again, I would like to tell you how much we should each like to thank all the citizens of the city and the countryside for the welcome they have given us. We are grateful from our hearts. Good luck to you and your government, particularly in your leadership for a good, better life for all your citizens, as exemplified in the new village you are building which yesterday we found very interesting. Good luck to the people of Pakistan and all your associates in government as well as yourself.
Note: The President, accompanied by President Ayub and Ambassador Rountree, went by helicopter to the Mauripur Airport.
