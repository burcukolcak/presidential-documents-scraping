Statement by the President on Early Mailing of Christmas Gifts and Greetings.
OUR CHRISTMAS MAIL this year will be the heaviest in the history of the Post Office. To all the world, this will be evidence of the spirit which animates us in this season of peace and good will.
The men and women of the Post Office Department, I am sure, will meet our challenge to their efficiency in the traditional spirit of the postal service. Once again they will deliver every Christmas package, letter and card, mailed on time, by Christmas Day. We can help them by mailing early. Then, our gifts, our messages of cheer and Christmas greetings will reach our friends and loved ones to make the Holiday a joyous and happy time.
And, by mailing early, we will help give hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans, the men and women of the Post Office, a pleasant, joyful Christmas--free from the turmoil of last-minute mail pressures.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
