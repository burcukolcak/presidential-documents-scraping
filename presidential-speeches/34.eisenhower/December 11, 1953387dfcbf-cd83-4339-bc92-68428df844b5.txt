Statement by the President Calling for Aid to the Victims of the Fire in Pusan, Korea.
ADDING TO the already overwhelming misery in Korea, the refugee-packed city of Pusan recently suffered the greatest fire in its history. More than five thousand homes were destroyed, leaving thousands of sparsely clad and malnourished refugees without shelter. In addition to the very great amount of voluntary work they are doing to help the people of the brave Republic of Korea, American and other United Nations troops are now doing everything possible within their resources to provide the emergency aid so desperately needed as a result of this disaster.
Today, as we approach the Christmas season, I call upon all Americans to give generously to support the work of such groups as The American-Korean Foundation, American Relief for Korea, C.A.R.E., Church World Service, war relief services of various religious welfare organizations, and the other of our fine voluntary groups who now face this additional challenge and responsibility. Such aid is particularly fitting during this Christmas period.
