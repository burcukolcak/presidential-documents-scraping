Letter to Thomas J. Watson, Jr., Chairman, United States Council of the International Chamber of Commerce, on Membership in the Organization for Trade Cooperation.
[ Released December 11, 1956. Dated December 1, 1956 ]
Dear Tom:
I want to express my appreciation for your letter of November twentieth on behalf of the United States Council of the International Chamber of Commerce.
I am heartened to know that the Council continues its support of the Administration's program for United States membership in the Organization for Trade Cooperation. It is the intention of the Administration to renew its request to the coming Congress for such membership and to seek earnestly for affirmative action.
I am especially interested in the last sentence of your letter which gives assurance that the United States Council will continue its efforts to explain to the public the compelling reasons for our membership in the organization. I encourage you most heartily in your efforts to spread knowledge about this important project throughout the business community and throughout the country generally.
With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
