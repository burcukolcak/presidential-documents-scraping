Dwight D. Eisenhower
December 12, 1953

Remarks to the Officers of the Pan American Medical Association.
THE LETTER that I am delivering to you is an official endorsement of your work. I can't tell you how delighted I am that you have taken such a professional interest in the great problems of health in the Western Hemisphere. Whatever can properly be done to help out the efforts of your Association, you can be sure that, while I have so stated in my letter, I will surely do.
I am sure that every step that produces better solidarity in the Western Hemisphere is to the good of the United States of America. I am sure also that every representative here of other American countries would feel the same way about that solidarity with respect to his country. So I am all for it.
I will see you out on the North Portico for a picture in a few minutes.
Note: See Item 260 for text of the letter referred to by the President.
