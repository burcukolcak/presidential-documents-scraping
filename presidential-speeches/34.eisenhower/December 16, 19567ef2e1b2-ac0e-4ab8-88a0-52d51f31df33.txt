Remarks of Welcome to Prime Minister Nehru of India.
MR. PRIME MINISTER, this is an event to which I have long looked forward. It is a privilege and an honor to welcome you to this land--to this house.
I speak for the American people and the government when I say that we hope you will find your trip here most enjoyable-that you and your daughter will have a visit that is full of interest.
We thank you for coming.
Note: Prime Minister Nehru's reply follows:
"Mr. President, I am deeply grateful to you for the gracious invitation which has brought me here, and for your kind words. I have been looking forward to this visit for a long time, and now that I am here I feel happy to be not only your guest, Mr. President, but among the American people who are so very friendly and hospitable.
"I look forward to these few days here. I am only sorry that my visit is a short one.
"Thank you, sir."
The President greeted Prime Minister Nehru upon his arrival at the White House. Earlier the Vice President had welcomed him on his arrival at the National Airport, at 12:30 p.m.
