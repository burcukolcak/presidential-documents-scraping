Statement by the President Upon Issuing Proclamation Fixing the Cuban Sugar Quota at Zero.
I HAVE TODAY by proclamation fixed at zero the quota for imports of Cuban sugar during the first quarter of 1961. The proclamation expresses my finding that such action is in the national interest of the United States. It is applicable to imports of Cuban sugar through March

31, 1961, the expiration date of the present Sugar Act.
Since my proclamation of July 6 of this year the Government of Cuba has continued to follow a policy of deliberate hostility toward the United States and to commit steadily increasing amounts of its sugar crop to Communist countries. This further confirms the view I expressed at that time that the United States cannot now rely upon Cuba to supply a large part of the sugar needs of American consumers.
To replace supplies normally obtained from Cuba, the Department of Agriculture will shortly authorize the importation of non-quota sugar from other countries. These authorizations will be made in accordance with the formula laid down in the present Sugar Act as amended.
Despite my urgent recommendations to the contrary, Congress has provided that one of the countries from which replacement sugar must be purchased under this Act is the Dominican Republic. In view of the unanimous condemnation of the present Government of the Dominican Republic by the Organization of American States, replacement sugar purchases from that country will continue to be subject to special import fees. When the new Congress convenes next month I shall again recommend that it relieve the Executive from the obligation to purchase such sugar from the Dominican Republic.
Note: Proclamation 3383 "Determination of Cuban Sugar Quota to Supplement Proclamation No. 3355" is published in the Federal Register (25 F.R. 13131) and in the 1960 Supplement to title 3 of the Code of Federal Regulations. See also Item 223.
