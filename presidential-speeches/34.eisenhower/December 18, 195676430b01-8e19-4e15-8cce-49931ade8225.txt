Message to Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama on the Occasion of Japan' s Entry Into the United Nations.
Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
Please accept my heartfelt congratulations to the Japanese Government and people upon Japan's achieving long-deserved membership in the United Nations. All free nations repose in this organization their confidence for the peaceful future of mankind. The membership of Japan makes this concept more meaningful than ever before. The American people rejoice in the action of the General Assembly today and welcome Japan as a new and worthy associate in the world's struggle for peace.

Sincerely,
