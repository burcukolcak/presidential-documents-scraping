Remarks to the Ship's Company on Board the U.S.S. Des Moines.
IT HAS BEEN a great pleasure for my party and myself to be embarked in Admiral Anderson's fine fleet. We are particularly grateful, of course, to the officers and men of the Des Moines and Essex who have been our hosts for the past 3 days.
Speaking personally, I cannot tell you how much the opportunity to take a good rest has meant to me. More than that, it has been a very enjoyable experience. As always, when I embark in Navy ships, I have been impressed with the good spirit and dedication to duty that I have seen in this force. You have good reason to be proud of yourselves, and the ships in which you serve.
Yesterday I sent Christmas Greetings to all members of the Armed Forces. I know they will understand when I send the men of the Sixth Fleet special wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
Thank you--and God bless you.
Note: The President spoke over the public address system at 8:30 a.m. Vice Adm. George W. Anderson, Jr., was in command of the Sixth Fleet.
