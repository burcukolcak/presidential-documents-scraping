Joint Statement Following Discussions With Prime Minister Nehru of India.
PRIME MINISTER NEHRU and President Eisenhower had long anticipated a personal meeting to discuss current world problems. In three days in Washington and a day at the President's farm at Gettysburg, they were afforded in a completely informal atmosphere the opportunity for full and frank talks on a wide range of problems of interest and concern to both countries.
The talks confirmed the broad area of agreement between India and the United States, which are bound together in strong ties of friendship deriving from their common objectives and their adherence to the highest principles of free democracy. The principles and policies of the Governments of India and the United States have evolved on the basis of respect for the dignity of man and of the need to improve the welfare of the individual.
The Prime Minister and the President are convinced that the greater understanding of their respective policies reached at these talks will facilitate the constant efforts of India and the United States towards the achievement of peaceful and friendly intercourse among nations in accordance with the principles of the United Nations.
