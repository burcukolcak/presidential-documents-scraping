Dwight D. Eisenhower
December 20, 1960

Letter to Secretary Mueller Concerning U.S. Participation in the New York World's Fair of 1964-65.
Dear Mr. Secretary:
I have received your report of December 15, 1960, regarding United States participation in the New York World's Fair, and I approve your recommendations.
There is no doubt in my mind that the Federal Government should participate in the Fair. While I realize that the Congress must authorize formal participation and make the necessary appropriations, I believe that because of the urgency as to time and the strong probability of participation, the theme development and other planning required should be initiated immediately.
I, therefore, authorize and direct the Secretary of Commerce to be in charge of theme development and planning for the United States exhibit and further request that for policy guidance he should organize an appropriate interdepartmental committee and an advisory group of select leaders of American thought and action. The Director of the Bureau of the Budget will assist you in making the necessary arrangements for financing this activity.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Secretary Mueller's report, in the form of a letter dated December 15 and released with the President's reply, recommended United States participation in the fair. It further recommended that the theme of the U.S. exhibit should be broadly based, "reflecting what America is and will be--its abiding concern for individual freedom and responsibility--its developing opportunities for the individual, rather than, for example, just what America makes or can do."
