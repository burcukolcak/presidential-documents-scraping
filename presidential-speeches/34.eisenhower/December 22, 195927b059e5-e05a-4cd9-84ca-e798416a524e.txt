Remarks Upon Arrival at Nouasseur Air Force Base, Casablanca.
Your Majesty:
It is indeed a very great honor for me to be received here on the ground of this nation, which was the first nation that recognized the independence of the United States one and three quarters centuries ago..
So it is a definite feeling of kinship with this nation that I sense, as I come here to have these few hours with His Majesty and with his people. And my party and I, I assure you, do so with a feeling of honor and privilege.
Note: The President spoke at 11:15 a.m. He was met by His Majesty Mohamed V, King of Morocco, the Crown Prince, Prime Minister Moulay Abdallah Ibrahim, the Moroccan Cabinet, members of the diplomatic corps, and U.S. Ambassador Charles W. Yost.
