Letter to Dr. Howard L. Bevis in Acknowledgment of the Final Report of the President's Committee on Scientists and Engineers.
Dear Dr. Bevis:
I received the final Report of your Committee with pleasure and appreciation and was gratified to note the Committee's many accomplishments in stimulating action on a broad front to meet the Nation's scientific and technological manpower problems.
Our Nation continues to face urgent need to strengthen our scientific and technological resources, and it is of vital importance that we enlist the cooperation of all interested individuals and groups in dealing with the problems before us. The experience of the Committee will certainly be a useful guide in this regard, and you are to be congratulated for your efforts.
To you personally I extend my warm good wishes and ask that you express to the members of the Committee my sincere appreciation for their fine cooperation and effort.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
