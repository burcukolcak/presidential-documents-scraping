CITATION:
For outstanding contributions to the United States and science in the field of oceanographic research.
These officers and distinguished scientists are richly deserving of the appreciation and acclaim of the Government and the people of the United States. Their marked professional skill and resourcefulness, their scientific studies and courageous efforts while conducting operations at great personal risk, culminated on 23 January 1960 in a dive by the bathyscaph Trieste to the unprecedented depth of 37,800 feet, the deepest spot on the ocean floor known to man. This dive and others before it were made in the interest of science and to collect data for the United States Navy in this previously unexplored area of the earth. This, the first penetration of the deepest parts of the ocean, impressively demonstrates that the United States is in the forefront of oceanographic research.
As President of the United States, I extend the nation's recognition and gratitude for your resourcefulness, courage and devotion to duty and your contributions to our country and to all free men. I offer my personal congratulations.
Note: The President presented the awards in his office at the White House, as follows: to Mr. Piccard, the Distinguished Public Service Award; to Lieutenant Walsh, the Legion of Merit; to Dr. Rechnitzer, the Distinguished Civilian Service Award; to Lieutenant Shumaker, the Navy Commendation Ribbon with Metal Pendant.
