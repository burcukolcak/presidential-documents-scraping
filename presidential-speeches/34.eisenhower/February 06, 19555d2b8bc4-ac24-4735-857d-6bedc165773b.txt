[Released February 6, 1955. Dated January 3, 1955]
To the Boy Scouts of America:

Boy Scout Week gives all of us an opportunity to honor the two million, seven hundred and sixty-five thousand boys and their nearly one million leaders who make up this great organization. Self-development and service to others, independence and good citizenship, a sense of brotherhood and responsiveness to spiritual values--these qualities which Scouting fosters mean much to America. To all Boy Scouts I extend congratulations on what they are achieving and on what they promise for our nation's future.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: This message marked the opening of Boy Scout Week and commemorated the 45th anniversary of the organization. The President serves as Honorary President of the Boy Scouts of America.
