Letter to Dr. Henry Wriston on His Acceptance of the Chairmanship of the Commission on National Goals.
[Released February 7, 1960. Dated February 5, 1960]
Dear Henry:
I am glad to learn that you have agreed to accept the Chairmanship of the Commission on National Goals, and that this study will be carried forward through the American Assembly. As I have indicated in our conversations, I am hopeful that the panel will develop a broad outline of coordinated national policies and programs for the next decade and longer, and that it will, in the process, set up a series of goals in various areas of national activity.
While I would hope that your report could be completed before my term of office is ended, I am far more concerned about the breadth and depth of the study than in the exact timing of its completion. I am appending hereto a brief memorandum outlining in general terms some of my reasons for requesting you to participate in this inquiry.
I should like to emphasize my desire that the inquiry be conducted free of any direct connection with me or other portions of the Federal government. However, all Federal agencies will cooperate with you in any way you may desire, as will my staff.
With many thanks for your willingness to undertake this important assignment.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Dr. Wriston is president of the American Assembly, an affiliate of Columbia University. President Eisenhower had been closely associated with the Assembly during his term as the university's president. (See Item 86.)
