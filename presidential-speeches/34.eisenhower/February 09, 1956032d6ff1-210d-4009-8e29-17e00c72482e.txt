Letter to the Governors of the States on Traffic Safety.
[Released February 9, 1956. Dated February 7, 1956]
Dear Governor :
The appalling traffic toll requires our people's determination to increase and to extend the Nation's effort to make our highways safe. On a vehicle-mile basis we have made progress in recent years. But I am sure you will agree that this is not enough. Statistical progress does not lessen the tragedies that every year are visited upon thousands of American homes.
The Action Program, drafted at earlier conferences and strengthened and endorsed by the more than two thousand delegates who represented the states at the 1954 White House Conference, is definitely a step in the right direction. The question now is--how do we make it more effective?
To this end I am asking that the President's Committee for Traffic Safety consider the desirability of a series of regional conferences to intensify local participation in the Action Program. I am assured that this is possible and that the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Harlow H. Curtice, will be in touch with you shortly concerning the details.
Your continued cooperation and support will be very much appreciated.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: This letter was also sent to the President of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia.
