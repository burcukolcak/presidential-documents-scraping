Letter to Harlow H. Curtice, Chairman, the President's Committee for Traffic Safety.
[ Released February 9, 1956. Dated February 7, 1956 ]
Dear Mr. Curtice:
Despite the fact that the 1955 traffic accident record showed a decline on a vehicle-mile basis, the number of fatalities on our streets and highways continues a major national concern.
If we are to reduce traffic fatalities in the months and years ahead, we must move forward more rapidly in applying the traffic safety measures set forth in the Action Program. Organized public support for these proved techniques was recognized by the 1954 White House Conference on Highway Safety as the primary essential to application by the States and communities. I am convinced that the Conference recommendation for the organizing of public support groups must be fully applied by all States, counties, and cities. To re-emphasize this urgency I am heartily in favor of a series of regional traffic safety conferences as you have suggested. I understand that the President's Committee for Traffic Safety is prepared to sponsor these conferences.
In view of the seriousness of the problem, will you, therefore, as Chairman of the President's Committee for Traffic Safety, arrange for these conferences as soon as possible. I am confident that you will find citizens and public officials ready to cooperate. In this connection, I am following your further suggestion that I write to the Governor of each of the States concerning the conferences.
You know my own intense interest in this problem, and you may be certain that you, and those who will work with you in this undertaking, will have my full support.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The Action Program is contained in a pamphlet developed by traffic safety committees and endorsed by the 1954 White House Conference on Highway Safety.
