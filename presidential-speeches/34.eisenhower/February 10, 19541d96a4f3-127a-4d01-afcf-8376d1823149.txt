Statement by the President on the Participation by Eugene, Oregon, in the Multiple Purpose Development of the McKenzie River
BY JOINING with the Federal government in the multiple purpose development of the McKenzie River, the City of Eugene, Oregon, is pioneering in the new concept of power development in the Pacific Northwest.
I have had an opportunity to study the program which the Eugene Water and Electric Board and the Corps of Engineers have jointly developed. Under the plan, the Federal government will undertake the construction of flood control works on the McKenzie and the City will underwrite the cost of construction of power facilities and transmission lines.
This program, when carded to a successful conclusion gives the local people a responsibility in the important development work. It is true partnership and conforms to the power policy of this Administration.
Legislation has been introduced by Senator Cordon and Congressman Ellsworth to carry this policy into effect.
Note: The President referred to S. 2920 and H.R. 7815, introduced on February 9.
