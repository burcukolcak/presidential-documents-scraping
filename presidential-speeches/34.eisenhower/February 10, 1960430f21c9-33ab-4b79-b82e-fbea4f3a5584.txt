Dwight D. Eisenhower
February 10, 1960

Remarks After Inspecting the Missile Test Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida.
WELL, it was an interesting day, and I have been wanting to come here for a long time, so it's a trip that's another realization of an ambition.
Obviously, it is the most highly instrumented place you can imagine, and certainly the personnel show every evidence of a high degree of competence.
So from my viewpoint it was a very worthwhile trip, and I hope it has been for you fellows.
Good luck to you.
Note: The President spoke at the airstrip before boarding a plane to return to Washington. His remarks were addressed primarily to the reporters who accompanied him.
