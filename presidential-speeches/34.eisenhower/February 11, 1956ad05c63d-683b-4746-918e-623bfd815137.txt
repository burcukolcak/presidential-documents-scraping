Telegram to the President of Italy Expressing Sympathy for the People in Snow-Stricken Areas.
His Excellency Giovanni Gronchi

President of the Italian Republic
I wish to express to you in the name of the Government and the people of the United States our deep sympathy for the suffering caused to so many of the Italian people in the snow-stricken areas of your country.
Whatever assistance United States forces, stationed in Italy, may have been able to provide to alleviate this suffering is a matter of gratification to me and to the American people.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
