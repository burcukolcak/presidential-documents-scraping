Letter to Representative Halleck Concerning Citizens' Views on Excessive Government Spending.
[Released February 13, 1959. Dated February 12, 1959]
Dear Charlie:

I am happy to have your February 9th letter, advising me that many citizens are making themselves heard on the subject of excessive governmental spending. This is most heartening news. I earnestly hope it foretells widespread public insistence that government, in these prosperous times, must live within its means.
I believe the public will soon realize, perhaps better than now, that we are engaged in a contest between the public interest and a wide array of special interests, each demanding increased public spending in its particular area. You have effectively called attention to the importance of this struggle. I assure you that I intend to continue doing my level best to persuade the Congress to act responsibly for the general good in the face of the incessant special pleas for increased public spending.
I am stimulated by the letters you enclosed and hope that you and your colleagues will receive many hundreds more in the same vein.

With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: In his letter, released with the President's reply, Minority Leader Halleck stated that he was enclosing letters typical of thousands received in response to his recent appeal to the American people. He further stated that a theme of fear of rising costs and higher taxes ran through the letters, and that they pledged all-out support for a responsible budget policy.
