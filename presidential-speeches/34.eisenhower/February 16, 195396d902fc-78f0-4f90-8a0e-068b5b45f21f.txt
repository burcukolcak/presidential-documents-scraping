Letter to Colonel C. M. Boyer, Executive Director, Reserve Officers Association, Concerning National Defense Week.
[Released February 16, 1953. Dated February 15, 1953]
Dear Colonel Boyer :
I am delighted to join with the Reserve Officers Association and patriotic Americans everywhere in the observance of National Defense Week. A more fitting period for such purpose could hardly be chosen, for it embraces the birthdays of our two greatest Presidents--the one who led the founding of the Republic and the other who led its salvation.
National security is everybody's job today; I feel keenly that the Reserve Officers Association is deserving of commendation for its outstanding contribution in bringing public attention to bear on our urgent defense needs. The Association is uniquely equipped to do this, for its membership is at once part of the Armed Forces and part of the civilian community of the nation. The Reserve Officers Association has members in service from Europe to the Korean battlefront, and it has members in every city and town across the broad expanse of America.
Please accept my personal gratitude for your continued service to the nation and my best wishes for every success in your program for National Defense Week.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
