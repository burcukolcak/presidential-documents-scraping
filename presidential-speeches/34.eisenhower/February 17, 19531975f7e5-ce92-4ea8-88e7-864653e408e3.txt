Letter to James W. Cothran, Commander in Chief, Veterans of Foreign Wars.
Dear Mr. Cothran:

I am most sorry that it is impossible for me to be with you this evening. The Annual Dinner Honoring Members of Congress Who Have Served in the Armed Forces is an occasion of real dignity and high purpose, in the honor it pays to those many men in Congress who have responded to their country's need with such distinction.
Quite naturally, I have a feeling of special comradeship with the Veterans of Foreign Wars who will be with you this evening, for so many of the service veterans in the Congress were associated with me in our Crusade in Europe. They have proved themselves to be not only fine soldiers but also statesmen. Their service overseas profoundly strengthened their capacity and understanding to meet the soberest problems of government.
I should like, with this greeting which I beg you to convey, to congratulate and salute them.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
