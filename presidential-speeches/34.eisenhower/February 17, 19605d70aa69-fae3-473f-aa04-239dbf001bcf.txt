Memorandum on the 1960 Red Cross Campaign.
[Released February 17, 1960. Dated February 16, 1960]
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
During the month of March, the American National Red Cross conducts its annual campaign for members and funds. This is one of the three campaigns authorized within the Executive Departments and Agencies. However, those local Red Cross chapters that obtained financial requirements through partnership in Federated Fund Campaigns will not make their appeals at this time.
By Congressional Charter, the Red Cross is required to provide welfare services to members of the Armed Forces and their families at home and overseas. It maintains a program of Disaster Preparedness and Relief. It offers other vital services in the fields of First Aid and Water Safety, Home Nursing, and various youth training programs.
The American people have long provided the volunteers and the funds that make this great work possible. I urge employees of the Federal Government and members of the military establishments to continue their fine record in support of the Red Cross.
