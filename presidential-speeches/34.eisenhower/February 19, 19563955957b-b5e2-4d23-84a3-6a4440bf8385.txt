Statement by the President Expressing Concern Over the Distress Caused by the Extreme Winter Weather in Europe.
I HAVE OBSERVED with growing concern the reports that have come from Western European countries regarding the suffering and damage that has been caused by one of the worst winters in that area--possibly the worst in the past two or three decades.
I want to extend my country's deep-felt and sincere concern for the suffering peoples in the afflicted areas.
The United States stands ready to make supplies of agricultural commodities which we have in abundance available for relieving the distress of the people in these areas. I have consulted with the Secretary of Agriculture, and while it is now too early to assess the damage realistically, both for the present and the immediate future, there is every indication that there will be need for such supplies. It has been reported, for example, that France alone has lost about one-third of her current wheat crop.
I know that the people of the United States will deem it a real privilege to put these agricultural commodities to the great service of relieving the suffering of our Western European neighbors. Such commodities can be made available for this purpose under authorities which already exist, pursuant to past actions taken by the Congress.
