Message to Prime Minister Karamanlis of Greece on the Cyprus Agreement.
[Released February 20, 1959. Dated February 19, 1959]
Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I want you to know how very pleased I am by the recent developments concerning Cyprus and how deeply impressed I am by the spirit which you and Foreign Minister Averoff have demonstrated in making this possible.
The conclusion of an agreement on Cyprus is recognized throughout the world as a victory of common sense. I think that it is much more than that; it is also an imaginative and courageous act of statesmanship which cannot fail to strengthen and encourage the whole NATO alliance.
I believe it is particularly significant that a final solution now promises to be reached within the framework of close Greek-Turkish cooperation. This cooperation offers tremendous advantages, not only to the two countries but indeed the entire Free World and particularly the Gypriot people themselves.
I am very much aware of the difficulties which the problem has caused you and your Government. For this reason I am all the more appreciative of the perseverance and understanding which your Government has shown in reaching an agreement.

With warm personal regard,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
