Message to Prime Minister Macmillan of the United Kingdom on the Cyprus Agreement.
[Released February 20, 1959. Dated February 19, 1959]
Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
Just at this moment I have received notice of the conclusion of an agreement between your Government and the Greek and Turkish Governments and the representatives of the Cypriot people concerning the future status of Cyprus. Though I am now visiting in Mexico, I feel impelled to send you instantly my sincere felicitations.
I know what your personal leadership has meant to the efforts to bring about a peaceful and equitable solution, and I share your satisfaction that the foundation has now been established for a settlement acceptable to the Gypriot people which at the same time contributes to the closer cooperation of Greece, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.
Please convey also to Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Lennox-Boyd, and Governor Foot my admiration for the contribution which they have made in making this agreement possible.

With warm regard,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
