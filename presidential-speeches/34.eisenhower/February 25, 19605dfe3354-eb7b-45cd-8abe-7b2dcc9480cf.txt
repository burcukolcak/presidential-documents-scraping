Dwight D. Eisenhower
February 25, 1960

Remarks Upon Arrival at Congonhas Airport, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Mr. President, Governor Carvalho Pinto, Mayor de Barros, citizens of Sao Paulo:
Yesterday I referred to a rumor I have often heard--that Sao Paulo is the fastest growing city in the world--center of Brazilian commerce and industry. Certainly it is a sincere personal pleasure to have this opportunity today to witness firsthand the mighty achievements of this fabulous community.
In addition to seeing evidence of Brazil's remarkable economic and industrial growth, I have another very special and, to me, deeply moving, mission to perform in your city. Later today, I shall have the honor of paying homage to those brave soldiers of Brazil who were my comrades-in-arms during World War II.
My nation--and all free nations--have reason to remember with gratitude Brazil's partnership in two World Wars.
You made your bases available for our common cause--bases which were truly springboards to victory. On land, sea, and air, Brazilian cooperation was of inestimable value in defeating our enemies and preserving a way of life we cherish. Gallant Brazilian blood, shed with ours, must ever remind us of our solemn, common covenant to preserve the peace, with justice and freedom for all.
I thank all of you for the warmth and cordiality of your welcome, Governor and Mr. Mayor. It is a real privilege to be here.
Note: The President spoke at 9:45 a.m. He was met by Governor Carlos Alberto Carvalho Pinto, Mayor Adhemar de Barros, Dr. Potado Rus de Mello Juqueira, President of the Legislative Assembly, Dsembargador Joao Marcelino Gonzaga, President of the Court of Justice, and other officials.
