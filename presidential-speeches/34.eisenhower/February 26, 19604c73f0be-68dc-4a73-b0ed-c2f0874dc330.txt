Remarks Upon Arrival at Ezeiza Airport, Buenos Aires.
Mr. President, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:
With genuine pleasure and satisfaction, I greet you in friendship as I begin my visit in the Republic of Argentina.
My pleasure is in realizing a long-cherished wish to view this beautiful land, and in returning officially the visit which your President and Mrs. Frondizi graciously made to my country.
My satisfaction derives from the knowledge that our commitment to common aspirations provides one stone in the structure of world peace.
I am especially happy that my visit occurs during the 150th anniversary of your nation's valiant fight for freedom. With pride in our own long adherence to the democratic vision, we of my country salute you, and welcome this opportunity to join our voices joyously with yours in your meaningful celebration.
I bring all of you the heartfelt good wishes of the Government and the people of the United States of America. In the few days we shall be here among you, we hope to meet many of you personally, to enjoy the grandeur of your world-famed capital, to visit several other of your beautiful cities, and, at least from the air, to obtain a panoramic perspective of your vast and noble country.
Al gran pueblo Argentino, Salud!
Note: The President spoke at 11 a.m. He was met by President Arturo Frondizi, Foreign Minister Diogenes Toboada, and U.S. Ambassador Willard L. Beaulac.
