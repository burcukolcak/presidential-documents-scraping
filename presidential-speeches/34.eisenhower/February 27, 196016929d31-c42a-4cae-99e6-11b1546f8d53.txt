Remarks to the Members of the Supreme Court of Argentina.
Your Excellendes, Ministers of the Supreme Court, distinguished guests and friends:
I have paid my respects upon your President, and to your legislative branch. The Western democracies have learned that true democracy exists only when those who interpret the law are completely free of the authority of the people who make the law and execute the law. I think the words of Jose' de San Martin on this matter were not only eloquent but were completely accurate.
So I felt that as I made this hurried trip to this great country and spent these few hours in your capital, that I would be remiss should I fail to pay my respects on the Supreme Court where the interpretation of law, the determination of its constitutionality, and the final word in determination that the rights of the individual are always protected--where all this work is done.
So, sir, I feel that it has been a great privilege for me, and a great honor, to have met this number of your judiciary in this country.
Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at the Palacio de Tribunales following remarks of welcome by Dr. Benjamin Villegas Basavilbaso, Acting President of the Supreme Court. He left immediately for the airport in Buenos Aires for his flight at 9:25 a.m. to Mar del Plata.
