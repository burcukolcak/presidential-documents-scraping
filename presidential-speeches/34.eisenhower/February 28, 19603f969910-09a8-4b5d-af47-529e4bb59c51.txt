Dwight D. Eisenhower
February 28, 1960

Statement of the President Recorded for the Opening of the 1960 Red Cross Campaign.
My fellow Americans:
March is Red Cross Month.
Throughout our nation, the Red Cross will be seeking to raise the funds needed to keep it on the job. All of us need to come promptly and effectively to its support.
The Red Cross is truly an integral part of our national life--always ready to lend a helping hand to Americans in times of stress.
Each year the Red Cross participates in aiding our people in some 300

disasters. It provides food, shelter and medical care to the victims-and then helps those in need to rebuild or repair and refit their homes and to resume normal living. Even if Red Cross had no other humanitarian task, we would need to keep it strong for this purpose alone.
But disaster relief is only one of its many responsibilities. More than 3900 hospitals are provided blood collected by the Red Cross.. With 100 million people participating in water sports every year, Red Cross classes in swimming, life saving and small craft safety are effective in keeping the drowning rate down. Equally important are the courses in first aid and home nursing.
In addition to doing all these things, more than half the time of Red Cross staff and volunteers and one-third of its budget are expended in assisting members of our armed forces and veterans who need help.
The Red Cross does many other good things. Above all, it typifies the spirit of man helping man. Now it is our turn to show that spirit by supporting this great work. I am sure all Americans will respond generously.
And to you two million volunteers who make this wonderful work possible, I extend my gratitude and my thanks to all workers and supporters of the American Red Cross.
