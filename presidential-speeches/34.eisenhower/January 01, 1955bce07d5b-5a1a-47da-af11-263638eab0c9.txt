Memorandum Concerning the Government Employees Incentive Awards Program.
[Released January 1, 1955. Dated December 28, 1954]
To Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
The vast complexity of modern government demands a constant search for ways of conducting the public business with increased efficiency and economy. I am firmly convinced that employees of the Federal Government can, through their diligence and competence, make further significant contributions to the important task of improving Government operations. Wide participation by Federal employees in this task is essential if we are to derive full benefit from the ingenuity and inventiveness that exist in the Federal Service. This participation can be obtained only if all levels of management and supervision understand its importance, encourage it, and insure that it is promptly and properly recognized.
A means for adequately recognizing those employees who contribute to improved government operations, was provided by the Government Employees Incentive Awards Act passed by the 83rd Congress. This Act was a part of the Administration's legislative program on personnel management. Under it the Civil Service Commission was given general responsibility for the administration of a government-wide incentive awards program. The Commission has authorized each of you to establish and operate an incentive awards program within broad principles and guide lines. I am relying upon you to provide personal leadership for the incentive awards program in your agency.
I am looking forward to personal participation in the program through the provision in the Act for a Presidential award for employees rendering exceptionally meritorious service. The necessary instructions for submitting recommendations for this award are now being prepared.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
