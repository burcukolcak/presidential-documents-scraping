Statement by the President Concerning Hungarian Refugees.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL will continue to parole Hungarian refugees into the United States until such time as the Congress acts. This action, in my opinion, is clearly in the national interest. It will prevent a stoppage of the flow of these refugees and will permit the United States to continue, along with the other free nations of the world, to do its full share in providing a haven for these victims of oppression.
