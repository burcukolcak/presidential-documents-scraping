Letter Accepting Resignation of Arthur E. Summerfield as Postmaster General.
[ Released January 1, 1961. Dated December 30, 1960 ]
Dear Arthur:
The operation of the United States postal system during the past eight years under your direction has been better and more efficient than ever before in our history. I am accepting your resignation, effective January 20, 1961, and in so doing I wish to pay tribute to your dedication and management skill, and to the valuable services of your fine staff.
Particularly do I wish to thank you for your fine report of achievements of your Department. You have introduced outstanding improvements in the postal service: the Department's archaic accounting system has been corrected; a new Bureau of Personnel now makes the Department a model of modern personnel practices; an aggressive building and leasing program again enables the Post Office to keep up with increasing volumes of mail; a long-range program explores avenues for greater mechanization in the future.
Americans in all parts of the country are receiving faster postal service. As your report points out, the reorganized handling of local mail now brings next-day delivery to 168 million people in our dense population centers, expanded carrier service now accommodates the 9.3 million families in the growing suburbs, and 1.4 million farm families have been added to the rural delivery service.
I thank you for these services to the Nation and for your friendship over these past eight years. You have my very best wishes for the future as you return to private life. May good health and happiness be yours in the years ahead.
With warm regard,

As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Summerfield served during the entire 8 years of President. Eisenhower's administration. His letter of resignation, dated December 27, and his report, in the form of a letter, were released with the President's reply.
