Letter Accepting Resignation of Frederick H. Mueller as Secretary of Commerce.
[ Released January 2, 1961. Dated December 31, 1960 ]
Dear Fritz:
Under your leadership, the Department of Commerce has continued to be an articulate and effective voice for the American free enterprise system. You have always encouraged private initiative and you have been a major contributor to the constant fight against inflationary pressures. In accepting your resignation as Secretary of Commerce, effective January 20, 1961, I take the opportunity to pay tribute to you and your excellent staff.
Among the many significant accomplishments of your Department these past eight years, two deserve special mention--the Interstate and Defense Highway Program and the Export Expansion Program. As you point out in your report, the new 41,000 mile highway system has already opened vast new territory for recreation, homes and industry. Not only is it progressing at a most satisfactory rate, but the system is being constructed on a sound "pay-as-you-go" basis. The new National Export Expansion Program, started this year, has done much to improve and expand services and information to help American business sell more abroad. The rise in non-military exports this year must, in large part, be credited to the interest you have helped create in overseas business.
For these activities, as well as the broad range of other functions you have supervised, you have my appreciation and thanks. As you leave government service, I wish you health and happiness in the years to come.
With warm regard,

As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Mueller served as Secretary of Commerce from August 10, 1959, to January 20, 1961. His letter of resignation, dated December 30, and his report were released with the President's reply.
