Telegram to Basil O'Connor, President, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis.
[Released January 3, 1956. Dated December 30, 1955]
THE PAST YEAR has been an historic one in the battle against poliomyelitis. We now have a new and important weapon, the Salk vaccine. But the fight against polio is not yet won. In the past year, despite the protection afforded millions of children, tens of thousands of newly-stricken testify that total protection is not yet a reality.
Help must continue to provide for many thousands of polio victims. There is need for further research, for expanded professional knowledge, for continued care and rehabilitation. I am confident that the American people, by supporting The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and the March of Dimes, will help to meet these needs and hasten the arrival of the day when polio will be virtually eliminated from the earth.
