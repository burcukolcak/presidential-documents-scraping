Letter to Archibald J. Carey, Jr., Regarding Report of the President's Committee on Government Employment Policy.
Dear Dr. Carey:
Thank you for your report on the record of the President's Committee on Government Employment Policy. Because I consider this such an important statement, I am making it available to the public.
Yours has been a difficult task. Your high degree of success reflects great credit on your ability and wisdom and the devotion of your excellent staff.
I wish to pay special tribute to the Committee's commendable record in acting on complaints of discrimination. Of the 1,053 cases in which you were called upon to render opinion, corrective actions have been taken in 96 percent of these cases.
The Nation can ill afford discrimination. The Committee of which you are Chairman has made great strides in correcting grievous wrongs.
With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The report, in the form of a letter dated December 30, was released with the President's reply.
