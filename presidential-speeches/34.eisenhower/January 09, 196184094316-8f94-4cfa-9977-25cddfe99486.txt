Letter Accepting Resignation of James P. Mitchell as Secretary of Labor.
[ Released January 9, 1961. Dated January 6, 1961 ]
Dear Jim:
With great understanding, skill, and respect for all viewpoints, you have established in the Department of Labor new standards of usefulness to the Nation. In accepting your resignation as Secretary of Labor, as of January 20, 1961, I express my high regard for you and your capable staff.
There are many ways to measure the effectiveness of your work. One important indicator is that time lost because of strikes has been half that lost in the previous eight years.
Important new programs and administrative and structural changes have been initiated in the Department, as your report indicates. States have been encouraged and assisted in improving the welfare of their wage earners. Significant legislation has been passed, including the Landrum-Griffin Act in 1959, which guards against corruption and abuse of trust and power in labor-management affairs.
As you return to private life, you carry with you my deep appreciation for a job admirably done. May your future years bring good health and much happiness.
With warm regard,

As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Mitchell served as Secretary of Labor from October 9, 1953, to January 20, 1961. His letter of resignation, dated January 4, and his report were released with the President's reply.
