Letter Accepting Resignation of George B. Kistiakowsky as Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology.
[ Released January 9, 1961 . Dated January 6, 1961 ]
Dear George:
I accept, as I must, your resignation as my Special Assistant for Science and Technology, effective January 20, 1961. I do so with real regret, for the association we have enjoyed has meant a great deal to me. You have served not only with the utmost professional distinction but with a spirit of constructive helpfulness and outstanding dedication.
For your public-spirited service to your country and your unfailing assistance to me, I am everlastingly grateful. I especially appreciate your offer to continue to be available to me for future assistance.
As you return to the life of teaching and research--to which I know you are so deeply dedicated--you take with you my very best wishes for a future as rewarding and productive, both for yourself and for our country, as has been the period just ending. For my part, I shall continue to prize the opportunity we have shared, in company with your colleagues of the Science Advisory Committee and its panels, to work together for the good of the nation.
With warm regard,

As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
