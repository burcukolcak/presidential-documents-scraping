Memorandum on the 1958 Red Cross Campaign.
Memorandum [or the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
The American Red Cross is close to the hearts of all who are concerned with the needs of their neighbors. Because of its humanitarian purposes and effective work, Federal employees and military personnel have long given their support to its programs.

The past year has been a costly one for the Red Cross. Disaster reserves have been exhausted, and funds available for national emergency are dangerously low. In March, therefore, when the Red Cross makes its annual appeal for funds, it must receive an unusually generous response.
I am sure that officials and employees throughout the Federal establishment, together with military and civilian personnel overseas, will help make this a memorable campaign for the Red Cross.
