Letter to Eric A. Johnston on the Need for Public Information as to the Foreign Aspects of National Security.
Dear Eric:
In recent weeks there have come to the White House many inquiries with respect to the foreign aspects of our national security. They indicate a natural and keen desire to receive fuller information in these particular fields.
In our free society the Government has a duty to keep the people informed on what it proposes to do and why. Without full public awareness it is difficult for the Nation to put forward maximum effort and obtain maximum results. During your service with the Government as Chairman of the International Development Advisory Board and through your travels abroad you have gained firsthand knowledge of our economic development and security problems.
In the light of the numerous requests that I have received, it would be highly gratifying to me and a great service to the Nation if you would be willing to call in Washington a conference of business and organization leaders, bipartisan in character, to explore means of conveying to our citizens a fuller flow of information on the foreign aspects of our national security.

I do hope that you will feel that you can give the time to do this.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Johnston served as Chairman of the International Development Advisory Board from February 1, 1952, to September 25, 1957.
