Statement by the President on Receiving Report of the President's Committee on Government Contracts.
I URGENTLY call the attention of every American to the recommendations made to me today in the final report of the President's Committee on Government Contracts under the able chairmanship of Vice President Nixon. These recommendations, if acted upon, will bring our people closer to the great goal of full equality of opportunity.
This Committee has served the Nation well. It has had a most successful experience in promoting employment equality. The response to its efforts by Government contractors, employing hundreds of thousands of workers, has been gratifying.
Our national policy calls for equal job opportunity irrespective of race, color, religion, or national origin. Our world image as a nation and as a people depends to a great extent on how well we implement that policy. I am confident that every American will strive to make equal job opportunity in the United States a reality. The work of this Committee and its recommendations will go far in helping to achieve that worthy objective.
I want personally to thank all members of the Committee for their dedicated service.
Note: The final report of the President's Committee on Government Contracts entitled "Pattern for Progress" was published by the Government Printing Office (24 pp., 1960).
