Letter to Julius Ochs Adler, Chairman, National Security Training Commission, Concerning the Reserve Establishment.
Dear General Adler:
It meant a great deal to me to have the opportunity to discuss with you plans for arriving at decisions relative to the size and composition of our reserve forces. It will be of immeasurable assistance to the Office of Defense Mobilization, in its preparation of plans for presentation to the National Security Council for developing and maintaining an adequate reserve establishment, to have the benefit of the continued counsel of the National Security Training Commission.
Because of the wealth of information and experience with this problem which your Commission has gained in its long studies and investigations I suggest that you arrange to work closely with the Director of Defense Mobilization, Arthur S. Flemming.
The expression of deep appreciation I feel for the long hours of effort that you and your associates have contributed in the preparation of the excellent report submitted to me has been too long delayed. Your report will be of great value to all who are concerned with meeting this great national military need.
May I as well convey my personal regards to you and to each member of your Commission.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
