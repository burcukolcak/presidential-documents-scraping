Letter to Harris Ellsworth, Chairman, Civil Service Commission, on the 75th Anniversary of the Commission.
Dear Mr. Ellsworth:
The seventy-fifth anniversary of the Civil Service Commission gives me an opportunity to express my own personal appreciation for the work of the Commission and to sign the official Proclamation which expresses the gratitude of the Nation.
In this your Diamond Jubilee year, it is well to remember all the men and women who have taken part in advancing the life and spirit of the Civil Service Act of 1883. This means particularly those civil servants whose able and often selfless public service is a credit to the highest standards of American citizenship.
It is fitting that we take this occasion to rededicate ourselves to the principles upon which the merit system was founded. Please give my best wishes to all who are seeking to make this Jubilee celebration a well-known and meaningful observance.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
