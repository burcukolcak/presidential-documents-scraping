Letter to Karl G. Harr, Jr., Concerning His Duties With the Operations Coordinating Board.
Dear Mr. Harr:
I have today designated Mr. Gordon Gray, Chairman of the Operations Coordinating Board, vice Mr. Robert D. Murphy. Under this new arrangement I will look to Mr. Gray to give impartial and objective leadership and guidance for the work of the OCB as well as the work of the National Security Council and its Planning Board.
Within the framework of your duties as my Special Assistant, you are requested henceforth to make a special contribution to two major areas of the Operations Coordinating Board's work in addition to continuing to discharge your responsibilities with respect to the normal work of the OCB. The first of these is in taking the lead in initiating new proposals to the Board for actions within the framework of national security policies in response to opportunity and changes in the situation. The second is in placing particular emphasis on seeing that Board actions implementing national security policies contribute fully to the climate of foreign opinion the United States is seeking to achieve in the world.
You will, of course, continue as Vice Chairman of the OCB and I will expect you to continue to present OCB reports to the National Security Council as you have been doing since your appointment as my representative on the Board in March 1958.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
NOTE,: Mr. Harr was serving as Special Assistant to the President for Security Operations Coordination.
