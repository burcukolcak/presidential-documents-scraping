Statement by the President on the Death of Representative August H. Andresen.
IN THE PASSING of Representative August H. Andresen, the State of Minnesota and the Nation have lost a fine public servant, and I have lost a good friend.
A Member of the House of Representatives for thirty-one years, Mr. Andresen's service as a Congressman was marked by high integrity and great devotion to duty. He was an outstanding Representative who will be greatly missed.

Mrs. Eisenhower joins me in expressing our heartfelt sympathy to his brother.
