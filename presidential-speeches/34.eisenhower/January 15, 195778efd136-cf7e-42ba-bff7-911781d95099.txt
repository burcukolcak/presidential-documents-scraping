Letter of Congratulation to the Right Honorable Harold Macmillan.
[ Released January 15, 1957. Dated January 10, 1957 ]
Dear Harold,
I send my warmest congratulations to you on becoming Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Your distinguished career is well known on this side of the Atlantic, and has earned our widespread respect. My own warm admiration stems, as you know, from our association in North Africa and through the succeeding years. For me that association has been as agreeable as it has been productive.
I feel confident you will bring to your new task the same vision, determination and sympathetic understanding you have shown in the past. For myself, and for the people of the United States, let me wish you every success in carrying out the great responsibilities which now devolve upon you as Prime Minister.
With warm regard.
DWIGHT D. Eisenhower

My dear Friend,
Thank you for your kind message. I too have warm and vivid memories of the time when we worked together in North Africa, and of our association since then. You know how much importance I attach to the friendship between the peoples of Britain and the United States, not least because of my own personal links with your country. I look forward to working with you once again to further this friendship.
With all good wishes,
HAROLD MACMILLAN
