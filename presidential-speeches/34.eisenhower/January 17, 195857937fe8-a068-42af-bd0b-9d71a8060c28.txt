Telegram of Commendation to Commander and Crew of the U. S. S. Nautilus.
Comdr. W. R. Anderson

Commanding Officer

U. S. S. Nautilus

It is hard to believe that three years have passed since the Nautilus, the world's first nuclear-powered ship, reported "underway on nuclear power." Not only is this true, however, but her record shows that she has steamed over 100,000 miles--with but one refueling--and that her submerged travels total more than half this distance, and include cruising under the polar ice cap to within 200 miles of the North Pole.
To you, your crew, and your gallant ship--which has paced a revolution in naval tactics and construction--a sincere "Well Done."
