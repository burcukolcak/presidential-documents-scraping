FOR EXCEPTIONALLY MERITORIOUS SERVICE

AND DISTINGUISHED CONTRIBUTION

TO THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES
Over a period of many years, Gordon Gray has given dedicated service to the cause of peace and security. An outstanding public servant, he has borne with distinction and devotion responsibilities as Assistant Secretary, Under Secretary and Secretary of the Army, Director of the Psychological Strategy Board, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization, and Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. In all of these duties, he has shown wisdom, integrity and responsibility of the highest order.

With deep appreciation, I award him the Medal of Freedom.
