CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF

THE MEDAL OF FREEDOM

TO

CHRISTIAN A. HERTER

FOR EXCEPTIONALLY MERITORIOUS SERVICE

AND DISTINGUISHED CONTRIBUTION

TO THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES
During a lifetime of dedicated service, Christian Herter has made a distinguished contribution to world peace and to the safety of his nation. Selfless patriot and distinguished gentleman, he has brought a clear and lucid mind, a sense of history, intense devotion and steadfast courage to the cause of justice and well-being for his fellow man. He has borne heavy responsibilities with sagacity, imagination and patience coupled with perseverance.
As Secretary of State during one of the most trying times of our history, Christian Herter has stood as a symbol of strength and inspiration to those who love freedom.
It is with great appreciation and gratitude for his services to his country that I award him the Medal of Freedom.
