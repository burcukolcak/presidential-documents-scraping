CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF

THE MEDAL OF FREEDOM

TO

THOMAS S. GATES

FOR EXCEPTIONALLY MERITORIOUS SERVICE

AND DISTINGUISHED CONTRIBUTION

TO THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES
Through nearly seven years of service in the Department of Defense-as Under Secretary of the Navy, Secretary of the Navy, Deputy Secretary of Defense, and currently Secretary of Defense--Thomas Gates has worked with selfless dedication for the security of the United States and the Free World. He has brought experienced leadership, sound judgment, and unswerving loyalty and courage to the heavy responsibilities assigned to him.
Through his effective leadership in the direction of the United States military forces, and his statesmanship and diplomatic skill in numerous international conferences on security affairs, he has made outstanding contributions to the constant effort of our Nation to attain the goal of world peace with freedom and honor. It is with great pleasure that I award to him the Medal of Freedom.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
