CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF

THE MEDAL OF FREEDOM

TO

JAMES H. DOUGLAS

FOR EXCEPTIONALLY MERITORIOUS SERVICE

AND DISTINGUISHED CONTRIBUTION

TO THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES
For nearly eight years--as Under Secretary of the Air Force, Secretary of the Air Force and currently as Deputy Secretary of Defense, James Douglas has borne major responsibilities in the shaping of military policy and programs, and in key decisions guiding the use of military resources.
Through sound judgment, wise leadership and great devotion to his country he has made an outstanding contribution to the effective direction of the Defense establishment, to our international security operations, and to the strengthening of cooperation and confidence between the United States and nations joined with us in collective security. For his firm and unyielding dedication to principles of good government, and for his many contributions to the nation's security, I award to him the Medal of Freedom.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
