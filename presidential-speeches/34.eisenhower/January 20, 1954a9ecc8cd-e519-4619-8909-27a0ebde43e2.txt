Statement by the President on the Approval by the Netherlands Parliament of the European Defense Community Treaty.
I HAVE just learned that the Netherlands, through action today by the First Chamber, has completed legislative action on the treaty to create the European Defense Community.
The Netherlands thus becomes the first country to complete the necessary legislative processes. I am gratified at the steady progress toward the achievement of conditions in Europe which will insure permanent peace and prosperity.
