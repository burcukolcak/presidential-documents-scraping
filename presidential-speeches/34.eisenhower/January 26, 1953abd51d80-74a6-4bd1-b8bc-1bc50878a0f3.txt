Statement by the President on Establishing the President's Committee on International Information Activities.
IT HAS LONG BEEN my conviction that a unified and dynamic effort in this field is essential to the security of the United States and of the other peoples in the community of free nations. All executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government are authorized and directed, as a matter of common concern, to cooperate with the Committee in its work.
The establishment of this Committee and the scope of its inquiry were discussed at the Cabinet meeting last Friday morning and received full and complete support.
The Committee's final report and recommendations are to be in my hands not later than June 30.
Note: The White House release of which this statement was a part announced that the President had appointed the following Committee members: William H. Jackson, Chairman; Robert Cutler, Administrative Assistant to the President; C. D. Jackson, representing the Secretary of State; Sigurd Larmon, representing the Director for Mutual Security; Gordon Gray; Barklie McKee Henry; and John C. Hughes. Abbott Washburn was named Executive Secretary. On February 19, 1953, Roger M. Kyes, Deputy Secretary of Defense, was also appointed.
A summary of the Committee's final report was released by the White House on July 8, 1953. See footnote to news conference of that date, p. 472.
