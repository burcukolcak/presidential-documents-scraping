Dwight D. Eisenhower
January 27, 1954

Remarks of Welcome to President Bayar of Turkey.
President and Madame Bayar:
It is a great privilege to speak for the American people and the Nation's Government in bidding you welcome here to the Capital.
On the personal side, Mrs. Eisenhower and I are very proud to have you, the Head of the great and friendly State of Turkey, as guests at the White House.
Note: The President greeted President Celal Bayar and Mme. Bayar on the North Portico of the White House at 5:00 p.m. A translation of President Bayar's reply follows:
I can hardly express the emotions that I feel at the warm acclaim that I have received ever since I have set foot on American soil.
I was very happy to accept the very kind invitation of that great soldier and statesman, your President Eisenhower, and of Mrs. Eisenhower. I am very proud to convey to them and to the American people the warm affection and the greetings of my Nation.
