Letter to Governor Egan Concerning the Presentation to Alaska of the First 49-Star Flag.
Dear Governor Egan:
This morning I presented to Senator Hugh Scott the first 49-star flag. This flag, which was made in Philadelphia at the Quartermaster Depot, U.S. Army, was used in the ceremony at the White House on January 3, 1959, when I signed the proclamation admitting Alaska as a State into the Union. Senator Scott will present this flag to the Mayor of Philadelphia on July fourth for display over Independence Hall on that day. From there I understand it will be carried to you to be flown over your State Capitol, after which it will be deposited in the Alaskan State Museum.
I should like to express my great pleasure at being able to convey through you to the people of Alaska the first flag of new design in forty seven years.
With sincere best wishes,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
The Honorable William A. Egan

Governor of Alaska

Juneau, Alaska
