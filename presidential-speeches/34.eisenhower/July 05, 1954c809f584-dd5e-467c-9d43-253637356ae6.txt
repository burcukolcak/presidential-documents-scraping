Message to the Mayor of Philadelphia for the Fourth of July Ceremonies at Independence Hall.
[Released July 5, 1954. Dated June 10, 1954]
Dear Mr. Mayor:
I send warm greetings to all citizens of Philadelphia and the distinguished friends joining them for the Fourth of July ceremonies at Independence Hall.
Because your city was the birthplace of our Declaration of Independence and was closely associated with many of the important incidents and figures of our Revolutionary history, it occupies a high place in American sentiment and memories. For most of us it symbolizes Freedom itself.
During the decades following upon those stirring events in Philadelphia, the march of freedom toward many corners of the globe seemed triumphant and certain to continue. But, beginning a score of years ago, it has suffered notably from forces marshalled by the leaders of Facism and Communism. Though their evil doctrines differ in some respects, they are as one in contempt of our concepts of liberty and human dignity. Both have disdained and attempted to destroy all religious belief and have ruled the millions under their control through cruelty, violence and deceit.
Important parts of these conspiracies have already been stopped by an outraged humanity. Eventually the others are certain to go, because in the long run nothing can stand before man's intense desire for personal liberty and his determination to worship in his own way.
On this Fourth of July we confidently strive toward the ultimate triumph of peace and justice in the world. May it be a conquest, we pray, accomplished not by force, but through patient perseverance and the growth of knowledge and understanding among nations and men.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
