Letter to Governor Michael A. Stepovich Certifying to the Enactment of the Alaska Statehood Bill.
Dear Governor Stepovich:
I am happy to certify to you, as required by section 7 of H. R. 7999, that this measure was today signed into law.
As you start the procedure that will, I hope, result in the admission of Alaska into the Union as a State, you and the people of Alaska have my very best wishes.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
