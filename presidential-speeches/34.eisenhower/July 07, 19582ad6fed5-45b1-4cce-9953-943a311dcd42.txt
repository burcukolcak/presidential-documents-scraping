Statement by the President Upon Signing Alaska Statehood Bill.
I HAVE TODAY approved H. R. 7999, to provide for the admission of the State of Alaska into the Union.
While I am pleased with the action of Congress admitting Alaska, I am extremely disturbed over reports that no action is contemplated by the current Congress on pending legislation to admit Hawaii as a State. My messages to Congress urging enactment of statehood legislation have particularly referred to the qualifications of Hawaii, as well as Alaska, and I personally believe that Hawaii is qualified for statehood equally with Alaska. The thousands of loyal, patriotic Americans in Hawaii who suffered the ravages of World War II with us and who experienced that first disastrous attack upon Pearl Harbor must not be forgotten.
Pursuant to section 10 of the Alaska Statehood Act, I am authorized to make special national defense withdrawals to assure that the defense requirements of our Nation are adequately protected. I have requested the Secretary of Defense to review our defense needs in Alaska, and to make recommendations to me with respect to the extent to which the authority vested in me by section 10 of the Act should be exercised.
Note: As enacted, H. R. 7999 is Public Law 85-508 (72 Stat. 339).
