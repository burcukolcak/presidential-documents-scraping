Memorandum to Federal Agencies on the United Givers Fund Campaign in the National Capital Area.
To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
This fall, the United Givers Fund of the National Capital Area will conduct its fourth annual campaign among us. This appeal seeks our voluntary support for nearly 150 local and national agencies which provide health and welfare services to the people of Washington and nearby Maryland and Virginia. As citizens of this area, your personnel will be asked to contribute to this Fund.
Among its many participating agencies are the American National Red Cross and its six metropolitan area chapters, the United Service Organizations (USO), the Salvation Army, the Boy and Girl Scouts, and others which meet many varied human needs. These voluntary health, welfare and character building agencies contribute much to the strength of our community.
The Honorable Neil H. McElroy, Secretary of Defense, has accepted the task of serving as Chairman of the Government Unit for the 1959 United Givers Fund Campaign. I know his fellow workers in Government will want to join in making this campaign an outstanding success.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
