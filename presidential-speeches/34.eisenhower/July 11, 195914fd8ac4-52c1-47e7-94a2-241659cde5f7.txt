Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting Report on Mass Transportation in the Washington Region.
[ Released July 11, 1959. Dated July 10, 1959 ]
Sir:
I herewith transmit for the consideration of the Congress the report of the National Capital Planning Commission and the National Capital Regional Planning Council on the Mass Transportation Survey of the Washington Region.
The report, the end result of several years of intensive study and research by the Planning Commission and Council, aided by experts drawn from public agencies and private concerns, points out the present and future problems of transportation of people and goods in the Region. The report also proposes a plan to meet the transportation problem and makes recommendations for organizing and financing the creation of the proposed transportation system.
The actions which may be taken in the years ahead to meet the problems of transportation will have a profound effect on the economy of the entire area, the welfare of its people, and the status of Washington as the Nation's Capital. Accordingly, I am requesting the various Government agencies to make a detailed study of the Mass Transportation Survey report and the Planning Commission and Council's recommendations. Such recommendations as are warranted will then be made to the Congress.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
