Statement by the President on the Death of Archbishop Michael.
THE SUDDEN and tragic passing of Archbishop Michael of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America is a great loss, not only to the members of his Church but to all Americans. As a spiritual leader, Archbishop Michael was a great force for good. His voice was always raised in the struggle to preserve the peace and to win understanding of peoples through the brotherhood of man.
Personally, I have lost a good friend and the world has lost a dedicated and devoted servant of Almighty God.
