Memorandum to Federal Agencies on the United Fund and Community Chest Campaigns.
To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
United Funds and Community Chests will make their annual appeals this fall throughout the country and among Federal civilian and military personnel. Many of these campaigns will include such national agencies as the American National Red Cross, the United Service Organizations (USO), as well as others working to eliminate disease and secure the health of us all. They will be seeking to raise more than $425,000,000.
We, in Government, want to assume our full citizen's share of this great charitable work. The United Fund and Community Chest campaigns provide us with an opportunity for doing this.
The Honorable Neil H. McElroy, Secretary of Defense, will serve as Vice Chairman of the United Community Campaigns for the Federal government throughout the country. I am confident everyone will cooperate gladly with him in these campaigns. It is my hope that employees of your department--in each community where it conducts its operations--will give thoughtfully and generously to these campaigns.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
