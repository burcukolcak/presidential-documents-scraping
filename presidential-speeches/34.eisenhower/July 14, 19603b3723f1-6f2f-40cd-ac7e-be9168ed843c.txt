Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Providing for the Admission of Refugees.
I HAVE today approved H.J. Res. 397, "To enable the United States to participate in the resettlement of certain refugees, and for other purposes," because of its general merit and the urgent need to accomplish the purposes of the measure. Under this provision, the special authority of the Attorney General to parole into the United States certain refugees could be terminated upon the adoption of a simple resolution to that effect by either House of Congress. The Attorney General has advised me that there is a serious question as to whether this provision is constitutional. Nevertheless, in view of the short period for which this power is given and the improbability that the issue will arise, it is believed that it would be better to defer a determination of the effect of such possible action until it is taken.
Note: As enacted, H.J. Res. 397 is Public Law 86-648 (74 Stat. 504).
The statement was released at the U.S. Naval Base, Newport, R.I.
