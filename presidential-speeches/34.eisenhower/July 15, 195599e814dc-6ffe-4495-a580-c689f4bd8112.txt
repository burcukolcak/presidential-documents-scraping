Letter to the Chairman, House Committee on Ways and Means, Concerning United States Membership in the Organization for Trade Cooperation.
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I appreciate your July fourteenth letter and readily understand your problem of arranging adequate Committee consideration of H.R. 5550 which would authorize U.S. membership in the Organization for Trade Cooperation.
The Committee on Ways and Means has borne a heavy burden of difficult and constructive legislation in this session of Congress. Much of that constructive effort has been concerned with legislation implementing various parts of the Administration's program in the field of foreign economic policy.
More remains to be done in this field. As your letter indicates, and as we recently discussed in my office, the passage of H.R. 5550 is especially important. This legislation will do much to vouchsafe to the American people and the free world the gains which will accrue from continuation of the enlightened trade policy provided for in H.R. 1. To assure orderly consideration of trade problems arising between nations is vital to our own interests as a great trading nation and to the interests of those joined with us in the cause of freedom. This great purpose will be powerfully advanced by Congressional approval of the proposed Organization for Trade Cooperation.
I share your view that it would be ill-advised to launch consideration of H.R. 5550 in your Committee when so little time remains in this session. A matter of this vital importance should have thorough hearings, discussion and debate.
The wise course of action, therefore, it seems to me, is the one you suggest in your letter. I am pleased indeed to have your assurance that H.R. 5550 will be among the very first measures to be considered by your Committee next year.

With kind regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
