Dwight D. Eisenhower
July 16, 1955

Remarks at the Keflavik Airport, Iceland.
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen:
I think it a fortunate circumstance for me that this mission to Europe brought me again to your country which has such a long history of friendship with my own. This is a much more pleasant day than when I last visited you--that was in mid-January.
This trip takes me to Europe in a search for peace. With my colleagues at the Geneva Conference, I shall hope that the cause of peace can be advanced for all the world--that people like yours--like ours--like the thirteen nations that are with us in NATO--all the others can achieve a more tranquil life with freedom and with justice.
I think it a very great privilege that I have a chance here for a very brief period to talk with you about the problems that lie before us and which are common to our two countries.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 10:50 a.m. His opening words "Mr. President" referred to President Asgeir Asgeirsson of Iceland. President Asgeirsson's remarks follow:
Mr. President, we are very pleased to welcome you to our country. This is a short stop, and we know how pressing your time is and how important your mission.
We wish you well and also success in your important work at the meeting in Geneva. We also wish you success in the work for peace and security.
