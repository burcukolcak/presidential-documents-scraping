Statement by the President on the Mutual Security Bill.
I HAVE just been advised that the House of Representatives has by a teller vote of 106 to 100 recommended an extremely serious cut in the defense support item of the Mutual Security Bill. This program is the essential assistance required to help support certain nations which are maintaining large forces as a part of the free world's defense effort.
A large part of this assistance is designed to support the defense efforts of Korea, Viet-Nam, and Free China which face potentially active military situations. Important amounts are included for Pakistan and Turkey which also maintain large defense forces in important free world areas. Without this economic assistance, their own military establishments would have to be reduced drastically, and the other nations of the free world, principally the United States, would have to carry a greatly increased burden. These five countries would receive 75 percent of defense support monies.
The legislation sponsored by the Administration called for $900 million for this program. The authorizing bill which was passed by the Senate reduced this amount to $800 million. The authorizing bill approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee cuts this item to $700 million. The teller vote taken by the House a short time ago, if sustained by the House, would cut this item to $500 million.
I view this cut with the utmost seriousness. It represents a reduction of nearly 50 percent from what the Administration has asked for this purpose--an estimate which represented in my sober judgment the best interests of the United States. The cut can be considered as no less than a threat to our nation's security and that of the free world. I sincerely trust that the sum authorized by the Senate will be accepted by the House.
Note: The Mutual Security Bill (S. 1957, is Public Law 85-141 (71 Stat. 2130), as enacted on August 14, 355).
