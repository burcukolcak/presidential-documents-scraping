I have received with deep appreciation your message of July 15 concerning the affirmative response of the United States to the plea for assistance from the Government of Lebanon. I am profoundly gratified by your support for this action, taken in accordance with the principle of the United Nations Charter which recognizes as inherent the right of all nations to work together and to seek help when necessary to preserve their independence.

The President
The White House
We have been informed by the United States Embassy in Ankara that upon the request of President Chamoun to the effect that the Eisenhower Doctrine be applied to Lebanon, the United States, in order to protect the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon, has decided to act and accordingly units of the Sixth fleet have landed in Beirut today.
This bold and appropriate decision of the United States will not only ensure the protection of the independence of Lebanon and the support of its legitimate government but will at the same time strengthen the determined position of Iran, Pakistan and Turkey and also renew and increase the faith of the free world in the leadership of the United States for the defense of the free nations.
We, meeting in Ankara, wish to convey to you, Mr. President, our appreciation and gratitude for this momentous decision in which we have deep satisfaction and relief.
