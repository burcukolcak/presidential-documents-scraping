Telegrams to Senators Kennedy and Johnson Offering Them Briefings by the Central Intelligence Agency.
The Honorable John F. Kennedy

Hyannisport, Mass.
I believe it to be in the national interest, and I hope it conforms to your desire, for you, as the duly designated candidate of one of the major parties for the Presidency of the United States, to have periodic briefings on the international scene from a responsible official in the Central Intelligence Agency. Acting on the assumption that you likewise believe such briefings to be in the national interest, I have already requested the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Allen Dulles, to arrange procedural details with you or with some designated member of your staff.
Because of the secret character of the information that would be furnished you, it would be exclusively for your personal knowledge. Otherwise, however, the receipt of such information would impose no restriction on full and free discussion.
On the assumption that you desire me to authorize similar briefings for the Honorable Lyndon Johnson, your Vice Presidential candidate, I am offering them to him by telegram today, and these briefings will go forward unless you advise of any view to the contrary that you might have.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The telegram to Senator Johnson, similar to the foregoing but without the last paragraph, was released with the telegram to Senator Kennedy and the latter's reply of acceptance at the U.S. Naval Base, Newport, R.I.
