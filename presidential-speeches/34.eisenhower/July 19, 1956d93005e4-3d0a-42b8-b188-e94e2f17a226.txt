Cablegram to the Supreme Chief of State of Honduras on the Death of Ambassador Izaguirre.
His Excellency

Senor don Julio Lozano Diaz

Supreme Chief of State

of the Republic of Honduras

Tegucigalpa
On behalf of the Government and people of the United States, I wish to convey to Your Excellency's Government and to the people of Honduras, the deep sense of grief which the passing of your Ambassador, General Carlos Izaguirre, has occasioned. Ambassador Izaguirre has fulfilled his mission to this country ably and with distinction. Honduras' great loss in the death of this distinguished citizen is shared by the many friends the Ambassador has made in the United States.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
