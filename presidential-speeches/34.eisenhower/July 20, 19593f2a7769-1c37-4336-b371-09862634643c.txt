Statement by the President on the Death of Admiral William D. Leahy.
IN THE passing of Admiral William D. Leahy the nation has lost an outstanding American and I have lost a close personal friend. As a Naval Officer and a diplomat, Admiral Leahy dedicated his life to the service of his country in war and in peace. Mrs. Eisenhower and I join with the people of America in mourning his death.
Note: In addition to the foregoing statement, the President issued Executive Order 10809 (24 F.R. 5817), which provided that, as a mark of respect to the memory of Admiral Leahy, the flag of the United States should be flown at half-staff on all Government buildings, grounds, and naval vessels until interment.
