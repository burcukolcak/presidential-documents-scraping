Memorandum to Federal Agencies on the United Givers Fund Campaign in the National Capital Area.
[Released July 23, 1957. Dated July 22, 1957]
To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
This fall marks the second annual United Givers Fund Campaign held in the National Capital Area. In this great appeal are included the needs of the Community Chest-Red Feather agencies, all of the local chapters of the American Red Cross, the USO and certain national health agencies--140 separate appeals united into one.
The United Givers Fund Campaign is the first of two campaigns conducted among us each year under the approved Federal Service fund-raising policy. During this campaign, all civilian and military personnel serving here are given an opportunity to contribute to the voluntary health and welfare agencies which are a basic part of America's tradition of charity.
The Honorable Fred A. Seaton, Secretary of the Interior, has kindly consented to act as Chairman of the Government Unit of the United Givers Fund Campaign. I know everyone will want to join him in making this 1957 fund-raising effort an outstanding success.
