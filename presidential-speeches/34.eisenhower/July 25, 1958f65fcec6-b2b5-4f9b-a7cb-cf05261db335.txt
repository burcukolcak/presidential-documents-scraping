Executive Order 10775—Amendment of Executive Order No. 10633, Establishing an Airspace Reservation Over the Las Vegas Project, Las Vegas, Nevada
By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 4 of the Air Commerce Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 570), it is ordered as follows:
That part of Executive Order No. 10633 of August 19, 1955, which describes the area of the Las Vegas Project, Las Vegas, Nevada, above which an airspace reservation has been established by the order, is hereby amended to read as follows:
LAS VEGAS PROJECT, LAS VEGAS, NEVADA
Beginning at Lat. 37°17'00", Long. 115°45' 00"; thence due south to Lat. 37°12'00", Long. 115°45'00"; thence due west to Lat. 37°12'00", Long. 115°56'00"; thence due south to Lat. 38°41'00", Long. 115°56'00"; thence due west to Lat. 36°41'00", Long. 116'26'30"; thence due north to Lat. 36' 51'00", Long. 116°26'30"; thence due west to Lat. 36°51'00", Long. 116°33'30"; thence due north to Lat. 37°16'00", Long 116°33'30"; thence due east to Lat. 37°16'00", Long. 115°56'00"; thence due north to Lat. 37°17'00", Long. 115°56'00"; thence due east to Lat. 37°17'00", Long. 115°45'00", the point of beginning.
The effect of the amendment made by this order is to enlarge the said airspace reservation by including therein the air space above an area of approximately fifteen by forty miles at the western boundary of the reservation, so that the reservation will include all the air space above the Atomic Energy Commission's test-site area. The air space above the additional area was formerly a part of the restricted air space over the Las Vegas Bombing and Gunnery Range of the Department of the Air Force.
This order shall become effective thirty days after the date thereof.
