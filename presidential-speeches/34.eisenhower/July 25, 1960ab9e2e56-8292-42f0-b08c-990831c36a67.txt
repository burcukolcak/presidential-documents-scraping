Statement by the President Following the Firing of the Polaris Missile by the Submarine Patrick Henry
THIS DEMONSTRATION exceeds in significance for the nation's security even the most optimistic predictions that I had heard about the expected efficiency of this new weapons system. I am proud of the patriotic and competent personnel who have brought about this great achievement. Moreover, in the crew, officers and men, I find another example of traditional morale and training of our armed services personnel.
Note: The President made a noon tour of the submarine U.S.S. Patrick Henry, then boarded the Barbara Anne, from which he watched the firing of two Polaris missiles from the submarine.
