Statement by the President Concerning the Settlement of the Steel Strike.
IT IS GOOD NEWS that settlement of the steel strike by free collective bargaining between the United Steelworkers and the steel companies will bring about a resumption of production, will end the loss of jobs and pay for so many people, and has avoided a longer strike with all its serious consequences to the entire nation.
The Secretary of Labor and the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service were in constant consultation with both parties and were helpful, I believe, in bringing about this settlement.
