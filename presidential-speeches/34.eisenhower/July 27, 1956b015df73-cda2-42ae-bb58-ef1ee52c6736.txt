Dwight D. Eisenhower
July 27, 1956

Statement by the President Following the Collision Between the Andrea Doria and the Stockholm.
TO ALL THOSE, of whatever nationality, who participated in the rescue operations following the tragic collision between the Andrea Doria and the Stockholm, I extend personal congratulations and admiration.
The speed with which rescue craft arrived on the scene and the efficient manner in which rescue operations were placed under way saved the lives of many of the passengers and crew of the Andrea Doria. Without such assistance, the tragic toll of life from the accident would have been much higher.
The rescue work was conducted in the finest tradition of maritime service.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The S. S. Andrea Doria and the S. S. Stockholm collided at sea 45 miles south of Nantucket Island on July 25.
