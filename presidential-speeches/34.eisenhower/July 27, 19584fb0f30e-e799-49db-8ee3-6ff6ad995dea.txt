Exchange of Letters Between the President and President Chamoun of Lebanon.
[Released July 27, 1958. Dated July 25, 1958]
Dear Mr. President:
I wish to thank you for your message of July 21 in which you express personally and on behalf of Lebanon gratitude for the United States' affirmative response to Lebanon's call for assistance. The purpose of our action was to help your country preserve its independence, in accord with the inherent right of nations to cooperate for self-defense. Our countries have long enjoyed close and friendly relations, and I look forward to further cooperation between the American people and the people of Lebanon in furthering the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: President Chamoun's letter follows:
Dear Mr. President:
I wish to express to you on my own personal behalf and on behalf of Lebanon, and through you to the Government and people of the United States, our profound gratitude for responding to my call for help, based on a decision by the legitimate Government of Lebanon, through the landing of United States forces in Lebanon to help us defend our independence and integrity in conformity with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.
I want to assure you, Mr. President, that we are both happy and honored to find ourselves side by side with the great American nation defending not only our independence and integrity against direct aggression, but the high principles in which the free world believes and by which it lives.
Faithfully yours,
CAMILLE CHAMOUN
