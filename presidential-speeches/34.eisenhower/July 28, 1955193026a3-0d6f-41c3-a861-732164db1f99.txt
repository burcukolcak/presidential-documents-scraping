Statement by the President on Congressional Action Regarding a Nationwide System of Highways.
I AM deeply disappointed by the rejection by the House of Representatives of legislation to authorize a nationwide system of highways.

The nation badly needs new highways. The good of our people, of our economy and of our defense, requires that construction of these highways be undertaken at once.
There is difference of conviction, I realize, over means of financing this construction. I have proposed one plan of financing which I consider to be sound. Others have proposed other methods. Adequate financing there must be, but contention over the method should not be permitted to deny our people these critically needed roads.
I would devoutly hope that the Congress would reconsider this entire matter before terminating this session.
