Statement by the President on Extending Aid to Flood Stricken Areas in Eastern and Central Europe.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE have followed with sympathy and compassion reports of the widespread human suffering which has already resulted from serious flood conditions in large areas of Central and Eastern Europe. Reports indicate that serious damage to homes and crops has occurred all along the Danube, and has been particularly heavy in Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia. Moreover, there has been considerable hardship and destruction of property along rivers in East Germany flowing north. The full extent of these losses cannot be known for several weeks.
In West Germany and Austria U.S. authorities have extended emergency assistance in an effort to alleviate the immediate situation. The United States is prepared to extend such aid as is feasible throughout the flood areas. We stand ready to make food available to lighten the burden on flood victims who are struggling to rehabilitate themselves.
The foodstuffs which can be made available without delay could be distributed through a mutually acceptable international agency. Various agencies are under consideration such as the League of Red Cross Societies. We are also making inquiries regarding the need for medical and other supplies.
I have asked our diplomatic missions in each country which has suffered flood damage to make themselves available to the local authorities in such a manner that we can be promptly and effectively of assistance to aid those in distress.
