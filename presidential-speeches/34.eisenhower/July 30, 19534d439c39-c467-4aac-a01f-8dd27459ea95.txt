Dwight D. Eisenhower
July 30, 1953

Statement by the President on the Responsibility of the United States Information Agency.
OUR OVERSEAS information service never carried a heavier responsibility than it does now. The service must clearly and factually present to the world the policies and objectives of the United States. It is not enough for us to have sound policies, dedicated to goals of universal peace, freedom, and progress. These policies must be made known to and understood by all peoples throughout the world. That is the responsibility of the new United States Information Agency.
Note: The President's statement was made on the occasion of the nomination of Theodore C. Streibert as the Agency's first Director.
