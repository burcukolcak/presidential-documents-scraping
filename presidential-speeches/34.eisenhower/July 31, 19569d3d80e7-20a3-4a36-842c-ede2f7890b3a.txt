Dwight D. Eisenhower
July 31, 1956

Statement by the President Upon Signing the Mutual Security Appropriation Act, 1957.
I HAVE TODAY approved H. R. 12130, the Mutual Security Appropriation Act, 1957, which appropriates $3,766,570,000 for further carrying out the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, and the Mutual Security Act of 1956. There are two provisions in the act relating to defense support where particular countries are named as eligible recipients of assistance in specified amounts. I regard these provisions as authorizations, and also as limitations on the availability of the amounts specified, rather than as directives. To construe them otherwise would raise substantial Constitutional questions.
Note: As enacted, H. R. 12130 is Public Law 853, 84th Congress (70 Stat. 733).
