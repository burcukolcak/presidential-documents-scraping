Statement by the President on the Record of the Department of Justice in Dealing With Subversive Activities.
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are the principal agents of the government in dealing with subversives. The record of legal action speaks for itself. I should like to summarize the latest figures just received from the Department of Justice.
In the sixteen months this Administration has been in office the Attorney General, working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, has:
1. Arrested 7 Connecticut leaders of the Communist Party last weekend in Connecticut and New York City.
2. Convicted 41 Communist Party leaders--13 in New York City, 7 in Honolulu, 5 in Pittsburgh, 5 in Seattle, 6 in Detroit, and 5 in St. Louis.
3. Indicted 20 additional Communist leaders, including 9 now on trial in Philadelphia and 11 soon to be tried in Cleveland.
4. Ordered the addition of 62 new organizations to the Department of Justice's list of subversive groups, making a total of 255.
5. Secured the conviction of 1 person for treason, and 2 for espionage. 8 others have been convicted for making false statements to the Government--3 have been convicted for perjury.
6. Deported 84 alien subversives.
7. Issued orders for deportation of 268 persons with records of subversive activity or affiliation.
8. Started denaturalization proceedings against 24 naturalized citizens charged with being subversives.
9. Barred entry into this country of 127 subversive aliens, who had arrived at ports of entry.
The constant surveillance of Communists in this country is a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week, 52-weeks-a-year job. It is carried out by the appropriate Federal agencies, in conformance with due process of law. It is being done quietly and relentlessly, and those who best know its effectiveness are the Communists themselves.
