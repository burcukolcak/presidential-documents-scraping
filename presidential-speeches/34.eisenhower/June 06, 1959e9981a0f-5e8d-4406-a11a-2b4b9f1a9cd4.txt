Message Transmitted Via the Moon to the Prime Minister and People of Canada Upon the Opening of the Prince Albert Radar Laboratory.
I AM delighted to greet you, Mr. Prime Minister, and the Canadian people on the occasion of the opening of the Prince Albert Radar Laboratory. The completion of this laboratory constitutes another major advance along the road of cooperative ventures between our two countries in defense research and other fields. The transmission of this message by way of the moon--a distance of almost half a million miles-emphasizes the technical importance of your new laboratory and is a specific illustration of the scientific cooperation between Canada and the United States. The work of this laboratory cannot fail to make a significant contribution, in future years, toward the solving of mutual problems.
Note: The message was recorded on tape and transmitted from the Millstone Hill Radar Observatory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory to the Prince Albert Radar Laboratory, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.
