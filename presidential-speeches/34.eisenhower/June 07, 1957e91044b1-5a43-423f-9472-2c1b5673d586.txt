Remarks to the Officers and Men of the U. S. S. Saratoga.
TO ADMIRAL PIRIE and his staff, and to the officers and men of the U. S. S. Saratoga, I want to express my appreciation for the interesting demonstrations my colleagues and I have witnessed on your fine ship. The Saratoga looks good. We know just as you do that she is good. Our special thanks to all of you for your many courtesies during these few hours we have been able to be with you.
Moreover, I want to express my personal and my official thanks to the officers and crews of all those ships that we know have been hunting the two pilots that we know have been downed in this region. My congratulations to those who have found and rescued one of the downed pilots, and doing it so expeditiously. And my prayerful hope--my sincere prayers--that they will find the second pilot very soon, alive and well.
Thank you very much and goodbye. Good sailing--and to all of you Good Luck in the important tasks which you are performing in defense of our country.
Note: The President spoke at noon, shortly before he left the U. S. S. Saratoga at Mayport, Fla., to return to Washington. He had spent two days aboard the aircraft carrier observing maneuvers off the coast of Florida.
