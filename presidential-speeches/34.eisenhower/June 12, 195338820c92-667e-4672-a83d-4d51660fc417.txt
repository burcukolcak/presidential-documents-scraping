[Released June 12, 1953. Dated June 11, 1953 ]
- My dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I thank you for your message received June 9 regarding the prisoner of war agreement reached at Panmunjom. I greatly appreciate your words regarding the part which the United States has played in this matter. It is my earnest hope that this agreement will speedily lead to an armistice and just peace in Korea, and to a relaxing of world tensions. India's participation in the work of the Repatriation Commission will mark a further significant contribution toward these ends.
Sincerely yours,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Nehru's message, transmitted by the Indian Ambassador, follows:
Please convey to President Eisenhower my congratulations on the signing of the P.O.W. Agreement at Panmunjom. The United States under the leadership of the President has played a wise and generous part in these negotiations which have resulted in an Agreement and I should like to offer my respectful congratulations to President Eisenhower for his leadership at this critical moment. I earnestly trust that this Agreement will lead to peace not only in the Far East but elsewhere.
