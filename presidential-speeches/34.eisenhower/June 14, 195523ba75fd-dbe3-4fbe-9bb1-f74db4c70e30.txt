Joint Statement Following Discussions With Chancellor Adenauer of Germany.
THE PRESIDENT, the Chancellor, the Secretary of State and their advisors met this morning and discussed the problems of concern to their two nations. They reviewed the political developments which have taken place since the Chancellor's last visit and noted with satisfaction that the bonds of friendship between their nations have become very close. They are of the opinion that the recent favorable developments in Europe are the result of the consistent, sound policies followed by the United States, the Federal Republic and their allies.
A large part of their discussion was devoted to the relationship between the nations of the free world and the Soviet Union and particularly the recent developments such as the willingness of the Soviet Union to participate in the Four Power conference and the invitation of the Soviet Government to the Chancellor. They agreed that one of the objectives of the forthcoming four-power meeting will be to pave the way for early German reunification. It was confirmed that in their combined opinion the concept of neutrality is in no way applicable to Germany and that only in collective security arrangements can Germany assure its independence.
As a result of their discussions, they are reassured that there is a very broad field of understanding between them. They are convinced that the achievement of the policies upon which Germany and the United States are embarked will continue to require closest cooperation in the future. These policies are based on a common adherence to the furtherance of a just and enduring peace among the nations of the world.
