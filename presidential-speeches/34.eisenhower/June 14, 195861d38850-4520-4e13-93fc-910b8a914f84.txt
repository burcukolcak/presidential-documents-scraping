Memorandum to Federal Agencies on the United Givers fund.
[Released June 14, 1958. Dated June 13, 1958]
To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
The United Givers fund will hold its third annual campaign in the National Capital Area this fall. This great appeal supports the work of scores of local agencies serving almost 500,000 people yearly in Washington and nearby Maryland and Virginia. The campaign also includes the six metropolitan area chapters of the American National Red Cross, the USO, local hospital care and certain national health agencies.
The United Givers fund campaign is the first of two campaigns conducted each year among all civilian and military personnel in the area under the federal service fund-raising policy. The vitally needed services, provided by the many agencies sharing in the United Givers fund, directly or indirectly benefit everyone living in the National Capital Area.
The Honorable William P. Rogers, Attorney General of the United States, has kindly consented to act as Chairman of the Government Unit for the 1958 United Givers fund Campaign. I know all Government personnel will want to join with him in making this community-wide fund-raising effort an outstanding success.
