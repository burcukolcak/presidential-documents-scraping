Statement by the President Regarding a Grant of Additional Aid to West Berlin.
IT GIVES ME particular satisfaction at this time to announce that, following discussions with the authorities of West Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany, the United States is granting an additional $50 million aid for West Berlin. This grant of Mutual Security Program funds will be used further to strengthen West Berlin's economy and enable the people to withstand the great pressures to which they are constantly exposed.
About one-third of this sum will be used in the city's industrial investment program. This aid will help provide jobs for Berlin's unemployed and will assist the city in paying its own way.
The balance will contribute to the fulfillment of the "stockpiling" program bolstering the West Berliners' security by providing stores of food, fuel, raw materials and other essentials.
No material contribution such as this, however, can adequately express the admiration of the American people for the courageous stand of the people of Berlin in the face of existing hazards and economic difficulties.
