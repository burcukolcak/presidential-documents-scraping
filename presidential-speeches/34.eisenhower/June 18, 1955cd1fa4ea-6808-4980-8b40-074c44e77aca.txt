Letter to T. S. Petersen Requesting Him To Serve on the President's Committee for Traffic Safety.
[Released June 18, 1955. Dated June 17, 1955]
Dear Ted:
This note is to request that you accept appointment to the Committee for Traffic Safety as the representative of businessmen.
As you know, Harlow Curtice has been serving in the dual capacity of Chairman and business representative. He now believes that the functioning of the Committee will be improved by having an individual other than the Chairman to represent each of the seven fields of interest covered by the Committee membership.
In view of your demonstrated interest in traffic accident prevention in California, I am certain that your participation in the work of the Committee will be of great benefit. I sincerely hope that you will be able to undertake this responsibility.

With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Mr. T. S. Petersen

President

Standard Oil Company of California
