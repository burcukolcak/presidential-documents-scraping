Remarks Upon Arrival at the Sungshan Airport, Taipei.
President Chiang, ladies and gentlemen:
First, Mr. President, I must thank you for your cordial words of welcome. I am indeed gratified that you saw fit to acknowledge the significance of this visit as one that attempts to bring even closer together our two countries.
For a long time I have hoped that I might be able to visit Taiwan. Therefore, I was delighted when I found I could accept your President's gracious invitation to come here.
I look forward to fruitful conversations with him as well as to the opportunity to salute the Chinese people on the rapid progress made on this island.
Our friendship, tested in war and in peace, is a real source of strength in our development of free World security.
The ideals that we share: our common commitment to self-government in our respective countries; our aspiration for a world of freedom, justice and peace and friendship under the rule of law; all these demand of us--as they do of all the free World--increased vigilance and closer cooperation in the face of the threats posed by Communist imperialism.
Mr. President, to your people I bring the personal assurance of America's steadfast solidarity with you and your Government in the defense of these ideals and in the pursuit of our common aspirations.
Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 10:01 a.m. He was greeted by President Chiang Kai-shek, Vice President Chen Cheng, and other Chinese Government officials, U.S. Ambassador Everett F. Drumright, and Vice Adm. Roland N. Smoot, Commander of the Taiwan Defense Command.
