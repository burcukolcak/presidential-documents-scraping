Remarks to the Officers and Men of the 7th fleet.
[ Broadcast from the President's Quarters aboard the U.S.S. St. Paul ]
GOOD MORNING. I take this opportunity to tell all of you how grateful my party and I are for all your effort to make this wonderful cruise possible.
Because of your hard work, thoughtfulness, and courtesy, we have enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and are indeed appreciative.
More important, however, than the gratitude of my party and myself, is the gratitude the American people feel for you and our servicemen all over the world for protecting our country.
Until the nations of the world find a way to insure their security without armaments, the Seventh fleet must be strong enough to support our allies, maintain our interests, and help keep the peace in the far East.
That strength is measured largely by the devotion to duty and professional skill of you, the men of the Seventh fleet.
The American people know you are doing your job well. They and the people of the free world are not deceived by the false propaganda of the Communism.
And now may I say goodbye, good luck, and smooth sailing. Thank you and God bless you.
