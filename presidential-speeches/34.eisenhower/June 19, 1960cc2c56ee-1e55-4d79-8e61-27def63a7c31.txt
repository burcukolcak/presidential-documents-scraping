Remarks at the Sungshan Airport, Taipei, Upon Leaving for Okinawa.
Mr. President, and ladies and gentlemen:
I leave the Republic of China with only one regret, that my visit has been so short. But I leave with a lasting impression of the warmth of your welcome, and renewed appreciation of the depth and permanence of the friendly ties that unite the Chinese and American peoples. I leave with an unforgettable impression of the dedication of the Chinese people to the cause of freedom.
My visit has been most instructive, as well as pleasant. My discussions with your distinguished Chief of State and members of the government have confirmed my belief that we have no more staunch friends anywhere than right here in Taiwan.
I have learned at first hand of the strides you have made in developing the military and economic strength of your country. I believe the plans that your leaders have developed will make of this land a living demonstration of the better life, political, economic, and social, and that this can be done by free men. Such a beacon of hope for your enslaved countrymen on the mainland will, I believe, hasten the dawn of freedom.
Finally--and I would speak also to the Americans here today, for they too are engaged in this endeavor let me assure you again of the full and unwavering support of the American Government and people for the important part you are playing in our joint efforts toward a world of peace with justice, in freedom. I know the American people would join me in saying God be with you, and may He bring you the measure of success which your deep dedication deserves.
Note: The President spoke at 9:45 a.m.
