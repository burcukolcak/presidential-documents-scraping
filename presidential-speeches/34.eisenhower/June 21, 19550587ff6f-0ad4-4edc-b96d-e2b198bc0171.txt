Dwight D. Eisenhower
June 21, 1955

Statement by the President Upon Signing the Trade Agreements Extension Act.
ENACTMENT of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955 is an important milestone in the development of our country's foreign economic policy. Supplemented by early approval of United States membership and participation in the proposed Organization for Trade Cooperation, the Act can contribute significantly to economic growth and economic well-being throughout the free world. In this way it will materially strengthen the defense capabilities of our friends abroad, and advance the mutual security of us all.
I am particularly gratified that this measure was supported by overwhelming majorities in both political parties. This bipartisanship demonstrates anew our unity in dealing with matters affecting our relations with other countries.
Note: As enacted, the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955 is Public Law 86, 84th Congress (69 Stat. 162).
