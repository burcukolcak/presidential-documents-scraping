I am deeply grateful for your kind message from Milwaukee and I reciprocate most cordially your expression of good wishes. It was indeed a pleasure for me to have a chance to talk with you during your stay in Washington. I share your viewpoint regarding the community of interests and ideas which exists between our respective Governments and peoples, and I know that your visit here has contributed materially to the further strengthening of the bonds of friendship between our two countries.

His Excellency Dwight D. Eisenhower President of the United States
In this moment of departing from the United States, my thoughts and all my best wishes are with you, dear Mr. President. I am happy in the assurance that your recovery is making rapid progress. The talks which I have had with you and Secretary of State Dulles have enhanced my consciousness of the profound fundamental community of our views and opinions. The other fruitful opportunities for exchanging ideas with key figures have shown me that this community has a broad and secure foundation in the public mind. Let me thank you sincerely also on behalf of those with me for the hospitable and memorable days.
Yours very devoted.
KONRAD ADENAUER
