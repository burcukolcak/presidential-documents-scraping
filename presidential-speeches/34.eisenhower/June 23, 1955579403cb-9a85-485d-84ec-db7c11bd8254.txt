Remarks at a Breakfast for Vermont Women Representatives of Dairy and Agricultural Organizations, Chittenden, Vermont.
OF COURSE, Mrs. Proctor and ladies, there is really nothing for me to say except thank you.

I thank you, of course, for this present. But far more for the cordial friendliness you have exhibited to me here. I count this breakfast a great opportunity to be a little closer to you people, to meet you, to exchange a hand-clasp and to go away believing that I have made some new friends among a people with whom I am going to leave a big portion of my heart.

Thank you.
Note: The President spoke at Mountain Top Inn at 8:58 a.m.
In his opening remarks the President referred to Mrs. Mortimer R. Proctor, of Proctor, Vt., in charge of women's activities for the Vermont State Dairy Festival, who presented a corsage of red clover, the State flower of Vermont.
