Letter to Gordon Gray, Director of Defense Mobilization, on His Becoming the President's Special Assistant for National Security Affairs.
Dear Gordon:
As you conclude the work of the Office of Defense Mobilization in preparation for the establishment of the new Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization, I write to thank you for the highly important contribution you have made to preparations against any national emergency. I know from our close association during this period how fully you have given of your time and energy to this work. Thanks in large part to your guidance, the Administration has continued to make good progress in adjusting, revising, and improving arrangements for any future mobilization so as to accord with ever-changing conditions. It is an effective defense mobilization program that will be available to the Director of the new Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization as he brings closer together the work of the two former agencies.
I am indeed glad that you are joining my immediate staff as my Special Assistant for National Security Affairs. I am encouraged and reassured by your willingness to accept this difficult assignment, especially because of the wealth of experience that you bring with you to the post. I look forward to the continuing close association that we will have in this highly critical area.

With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
