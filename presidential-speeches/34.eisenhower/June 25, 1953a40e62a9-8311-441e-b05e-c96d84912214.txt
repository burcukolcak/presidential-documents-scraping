Statement by the President Upon Signing the Pakistan Wheat Aid Act.
I AM DEEPLY GRATIFIED to sign this Act which makes it possible to send up to one million tons of wheat to help avert famine among the people of Pakistan. We are fortunate in being able to help them by sharing some of the fruits of our labor and soil.
Americans have a strong feeling of friendship for the people of Pakistan. We have great admiration for this young country which is engaged in a valiant and determined effort to overcome problems of tremendous magnitude. Their efforts remind us of the turmoil and struggle of our own early days--and the struggle which confronts us on a broader scale today.
We are proud to have such staunch friends as the people of Pakistan, who are dedicated to the democratic way of life. We are happy to be able to respond to their need with this aid.
The swift action by the Congress in making possible this aid, within two weeks after my message requesting such assistance, reflects the sympathy and concern of the people of the United States for the people of Pakistan.
Our sincere hopes for peace and prosperity go with this grain.
Note: The Pakistan Wheat Aid Act is Public Law 77, 83d Congress (67 Stat. 80).
