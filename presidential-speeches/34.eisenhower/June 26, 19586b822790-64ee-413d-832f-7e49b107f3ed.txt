Telegram to the Delegates to the Geneva Technical Conference on Nuclear Detection Methods.
Dr. James Brown Fisk

Idlewild Airport

New York, New York

I send to you, Dr. Bacher, and Dr. Lawrence my best wishes as you depart for a Geneva Conference designed to contribute to disarmament and peace. In view of the most recent expression of Soviet attitude you leave under uncertain conditions. But I and all the American people continue to hope that the door to understanding is still open. You are called on to play a significant part in a far-reaching project of deep concern to all mankind. We must, and shall, keep working at it. I want you and your associates to know that controlled disarmament is so vital that we are going to persevere in the face of whatever difficulties the Soviets may raise. Good luck.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: This telegram was sent to Dr. Fisk and his associates, Dr. Robert F. Bacher and Dr. Ernest O. Lawrence, as they were leaving the airport.
