Message to Prime Minister Churchill of Great Britain Concerning Postponement of the Bermuda Conversations.
[Released June 27, 1953. Dated June 26, 1953]
Dear Winston:
I am deeply distressed to learn that your physicians have advised you to lighten your duties at this time and that consequently you will be unable to come to Bermuda for our talks.
I look upon this only as a temporary deferment of our meeting. Your health is of great concern to all the world and you must, therefore, bow to the advice of your physicians.
With best wishes from your friend.
IKE
