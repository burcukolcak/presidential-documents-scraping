Remarks at the Fawn Presentation Ceremonies, Rangeley, Maine.
WELL, Candy, I thank you very much, and I am sure that the children of Washington will enjoy the deer.

Now I hope the deer likes its new home, too. But it may be like a lot of other folks that go to Washington, they find out they have left a lot behind.
I am sure if I were going away from these woods, along these lovely lakes and rivers, and had to go live in Washington, I would think twice, wouldn't you?

But I will take it down.

Good luck to you, and thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 2:05 p.m. Candy Tibbetts, the 12-yearold daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Verde Tibbetts of Rangeley, Maine, presented the month-old fawn as a gift from the children of that area to the children of Washington, D.C. It was placed in the National Zoological Park in Washington.
