Statement by the President to the People in Areas Affected by Hurricane Audrey.
ON BEHALF OF the people of the United States, I extend deepest sympathy to the people in the devastated areas of Louisiana and the other areas affected by Hurricane Audrey. Everything possible is being done to alleviate their suffering.
Federal, State and local governments are doing everything in their power to assist the victims of the disaster. The governmental agencies are conducting the work of survey and rescue and of rehabilitation. But of necessity this will be limited primarily to emergency measures and to the rebuilding of vital local functions-highways, public buildings and the restoration of utilities.
In the great task of rehabilitation--caring for evacuated persons, sheltering and feeding them, ministering to the sick and the hurt--the American Red Cross must and eventually will play a major role. The Red Cross whose financial resources are already severely taxed by this and other disaster operations currently under way will need the help of every citizen of our land.
Every one of us can participate in helping to relieve the suffering of his fellow Americans by contributing directly to local Red Cross chapters. I am confident that the American people will respond generously to help the Red Cross carry out its great humanitarian work.
