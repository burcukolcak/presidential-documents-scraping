Dwight D. Eisenhower
March 01, 1960

Remarks Upon Receiving a Medal Presented by Members of the National Congress of Chile.
Mr. President and Members of this Congress:
I cannot remember when I have been more deeply touched by any gift or any award than the one which you just accorded to me. But I do assure you that I need no symbol or any memento to keep buried deep in my heart and mind the pleasures and the interests--and indeed the instruction--I have received here in Chile.
This visit will always be one of my cherished memories. To have this medal as a visible token of your affection is indeed something for which I thank you from the very bottom of my heart--not only on my own behalf, and of my associates, but indeed on behalf of all my countrymen.
Thank you.
Note: The medal was presented by Senator Videla immediately following the President's address to the Chilean Congress (Item 73). The inscription reads "Congreso Nacional de Chile--Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1 March 1960."
