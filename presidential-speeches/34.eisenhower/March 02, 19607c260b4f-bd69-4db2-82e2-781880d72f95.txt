Remarks Upon Arrival at Carrasco Airport, Montevideo.
Mr. President of the National Council of Government, ladies and gentlemen:
The friendly reception you Have accorded my associates and me is especially gratifying, for to me it is indicative of the strong spiritual kinship between the governments and peoples of Uruguay and of the United States.
The fame of your democratic institutions has earned the applause of every American--school children and adults alike. We salute you, not only for your adherence to democratic principles in your own country, but also for your continuing contributions to hemispheric solidarity, to the Organization of American States, and to the United Nations. By deeds you have eloquently demonstrated your devotion to the concept of building a world characterized by peace, justice, and freedom.
I bring you this heartfelt message from all the people of my country: we treasure our partnership with you, and all our sister Republics in this hemisphere. We want this partnership to be a model of mutually helpful cooperation among sovereign states--some large, some small, but each equally contributing to the unity of purpose and effectiveness of the whole. How to make our partnership better shine as a beacon light to mankind will be the substance of my conversations with you, Mr. President, and with your associates in government.
I am delighted to be here, and look forward eagerly to meeting many of you during my short stay.
Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 2:10 p.m. He was greeted by President Benito Nardone and the other members of the National Council of Government, Foreign Minister Homero Martinez, and U.S. Ambassador Robert F. Woodward.
