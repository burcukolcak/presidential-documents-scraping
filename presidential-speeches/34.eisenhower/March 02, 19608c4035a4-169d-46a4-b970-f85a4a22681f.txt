Remarks at Los Cerrillos Airport in Santiago Upon Leaving for Uruguay.
Dr. Del Rio, ladies and gentlemen:
All too swiftly, the time has come for our departure from this magnificent land. On behalf of the members of my party and myself, I thank all of you sincerely for the hospitality and kindness you have shown us.
We have been heartened by the friendly and informative discussions we have held with His Excellency President Alessandri and other leaders of your government. I trust that they have found these conversations to be as helpful as we have.
As we prepare to embark, my mind goes back many years--to a time when both our countries were very young. In those days many pioneers in my country journeyed to the Western United States by sea, around South America. Thousands of them put into Chilean ports to rest from their arduous journey and to prepare for the northward part of their voyage.
Now, we could reach the capital of my country in a matter of hours-a journey which would have taken those pioneers many months.
Technology has indeed shrunk the world. Today all men are close neighbors.
Technology has given us the means of achieving a full life. But whether the possibility is realized is in the hands and minds of men.
Will men everywhere strive for the ideals of peace, freedom, and progress which our sturdy forefathers sought?
So far as Chile and the United States--and the nations of this hemisphere-are concerned, the answer is obviously a resounding "Yes!"
I leave with profound admiration for Chile's efforts for internal stability and progress, and for your noble work in the world community.
Goodbye--and thanks to all once again for your hospitality and friendship.
Note: The President's opening words referred to Dr. Sotero del Rio, Minister of the Interior and senior member of the Chilean Cabinet.
