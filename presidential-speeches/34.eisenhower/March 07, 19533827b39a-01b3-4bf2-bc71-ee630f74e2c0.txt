Statement by the President Following Meeting With Elliott Newcomb, Secretary General of the World Veterans Federation.
I HAVE been greatly encouraged to learn from Mr. Newcomb of the progress made among these millions of veterans in support of the United Nations and its stand in Korea, as well as its support of European Unity and collective security against aggression. No one can deny the right of those who have fought in the defense of freedom to unite in its defense today. The participation of several of our American veterans' organizations in this international federation of millions of ex-servicemen from many nations is gratifying proof that veterans of our nation are aware of the necessity of mutual understanding and common effort among men of good will from many lands.
