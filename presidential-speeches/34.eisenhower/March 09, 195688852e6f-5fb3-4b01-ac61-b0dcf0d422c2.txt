Letter to Douglas McKay, Secretary of the Interior, Following His Decision To Campaign for Election to the Senate.
[Released March 9, 1956. Dated March 8, 1956]
Dear Doug:
Your decision to campaign for election to the United States Senate from your beloved State of Oregon is worthy of the highest commendation.
As a personal matter, of course, I have mingled emotions. You have been a tremendous asset to us in the Cabinet and you will be missed. At the same time, it is easy to understand your desire to be of maximum personal service to your home State.
As a member of the United States Senate, you will add a great deal to the working strength we need and must have in order to carry out the objectives of this Administration. The vast experience you have gained in private life, as a veteran State Legislator, Governor, and able administrator of the vital affairs of the Department of the Interior, qualifies you for legislative judgments that will be of the utmost importance, not only to the people of Oregon but to the remainder of the nation as well.
I am delighted that you are willing to volunteer for continued duty in the public interest. You and your good wife will always have my very best wishes.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
