Letter to George A. Garrett, President, Federal City Council, Concerning the Redevelopment of Southwest Washington.
[Released March 16, 1955- Dated March 15, 1955]
Dear Mr. Garrett:
The redevelopment and renewal of the blighted areas of Washington is of concern not only to the citizens of the District of Columbia but to all the American people. All of us want the nation's capital, I am certain, to be the symbol of our country's best efforts to provide decent housing and attractive urban living.
One major redevelopment project is that for Southwest Washington. I understand that it has been under consideration for almost five years and has been the subject of active planning for some three years. The time has come to see it become a reality. It should move forward just as rapidly as a plan can be devised which harmoniously resolves the various problems involved.
It would be a great service to the nation's capital if you would undertake to confer with the appropriate agencies in an effort to bring about agreement on a workable program. As the President of the Federal City Council, and with your broad experiences in civic affairs, I am certain you can render a service of great value. I shall welcome a report of successful progress.

With best wishes,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
