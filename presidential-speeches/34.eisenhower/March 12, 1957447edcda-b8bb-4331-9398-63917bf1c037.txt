Dwight D. Eisenhower
March 12, 1957

Statement by the President on the Death of Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd.
IN THE PASSING of Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, America and the world have lost one of the truly great explorers of all time and I have lost an old and dear friend.
As Commander of two Arctic and five Antarctic expeditions, Admiral Byrd dedicated his life to the exploration of those little known areas. He was the first man to fly over both the North and South Poles. His explorations charted more than two million square miles of territory, adding tremendously to the world's scientific knowledge of the polar regions. This knowledge is important--and will become increasingly so in the years that lie ahead--and will always remain as a constant tribute to the memory of Admiral Byrd.
Mrs. Eisenhower and I, on behalf of all Americans, extend our heartfelt sympathy to the members of the Admiral's family. He was a gallant gentleman, a fearless and determined explorer, and a true servant of his country.
Note: In addition to the foregoing statement, the President issued Executive Order 10702, dated March 12, 1957, which provided that, as a mark of respect to the memory of Admiral Byrd, the flag of the United States should be flown at half-staff on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until interment.
