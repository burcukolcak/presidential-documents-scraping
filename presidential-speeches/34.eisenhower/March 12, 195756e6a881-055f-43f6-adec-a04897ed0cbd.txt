Dear Mr. President:
On the occasion of the anniversary of a decade of Turkish-American cooperation in the interest of security and economic progress, I am delighted to convey to you my greetings. I acclaim the accomplishments of Turkey during the past ten years in strengthening its position of enlightened leadership, and in taking an important part in the defense of the free world.
I am proud that Turkey and the United States have stood together during this difficult period. The partnership of our countries is a striking example of the way in which free nations working together can contribute to the peace and security of the international community.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
