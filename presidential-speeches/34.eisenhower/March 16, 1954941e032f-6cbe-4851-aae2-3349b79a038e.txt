Letter to the Governors of the States and Territories Requesting Them To Serve as Honorary Chairmen, United Defense Fund.
[Released March 16, 1954. Dated March 15, 1954]
Dear Governor:
Some time ago, I accepted the Honorary Chairmanship of the United Defense Fund. I did this because of my deep conviction that the defense of this country depends upon the voluntary activities of its citizens, as well as upon the authority of government. I am delighted that General of the Army Omar N. Bradley has accepted, at my request, the active campaign chairmanship.
There is great need this year for an aggressive campaign for financial support for the United Defense Services. We have moved from a fighting war to an armed peace, but the problem of sustaining the high morale of our defense forces is no less acute than during time of actual combat. If we are to maintain the United Defense Services--particularly those of the USO--on the desired high level, the understanding and support of the American people are vital.
In the task of marshalling this support, we hope to enlist as leaders the official heads of State and Territorial Governments. Accordingly, I am asking each State and Territorial Governor to serve as Honorary Chairman for the United Defense Fund in his State or Territory. I hope that it will be possible for you to accept this important assignment.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
