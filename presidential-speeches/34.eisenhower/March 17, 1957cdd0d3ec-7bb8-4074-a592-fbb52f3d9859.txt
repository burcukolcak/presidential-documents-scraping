Dwight D. Eisenhower
March 17, 1957

Statement by the President on the Death of President Magsaysay of the Philippine Republic.
IN THE TRAGIC DEATH of President Magsaysay, the people of the Philippine Republic, as well as those of the United States and the entire free world, have lost a valiant champion of freedom. I had been looking forward to meeting with President Magsaysay in Washington, to re-affirm the close and affectionate ties all Americans have with his people.
A staunch advocate of independence for his people, President Magsaysay was also an active and determined fighter against communism. He will be greatly missed.
Mrs. Eisenhower and I extend to his family not only our personal sympathies but also the heartfelt sympathies of all Americans, who have lost a good friend.
Note: This statement was issued to Bermuda on board the U. & S. while the President was on his way Canberra.
