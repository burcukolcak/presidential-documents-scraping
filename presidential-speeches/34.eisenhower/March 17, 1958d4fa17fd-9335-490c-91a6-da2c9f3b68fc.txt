Statement by the President: Launching of Vanguard Test Satellite.
I HAVE just been informed by Dr. Alan Waterman, Director of the National Science foundation, that a small test vehicle has been placed in orbit around the earth by the Vanguard rocket.

The orbiting is part of a series of tests which will be conducted prior to the launching of Vanguard satellites as part of the United States participation in International Geophysical Year.
