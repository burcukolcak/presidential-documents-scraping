Letter to the Director, Bureau of the Budget, Concerning the Admission of Hawaii.
Dear Mr. Stans:
In view of the imminent admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union, it is essential that the Federal Government promptly initiate a careful study of the effects of statehood and develop a systematic and coordinated program for effecting an orderly transition from territorial status to statehood.
I believe that the Bureau of the Budget should assume leadership for Executive Branch action in this area, beyond the regular responsibilities of the Department of the Interior, as it has done, at my request, in the case of Alaska statehood. Therefore, I am asking you, with the cooperation of the interested departments and agencies, to undertake the task of reviewing the implications of Hawaii statehood, developing a comprehensive plan for accomplishing the transition, and presenting to me recommendations for dealing with any matters requiring my attention.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
