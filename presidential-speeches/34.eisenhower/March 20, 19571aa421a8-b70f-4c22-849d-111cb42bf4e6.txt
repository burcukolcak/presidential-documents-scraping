Remarks Upon Arrival at Hamilton, Bermuda, for Conference With Prime Minister Macmillan.
Governor, Mr. Prime Minister, and ladies and gentlemen:
It is a great pleasure to be once again in this lovely Island. Since the Prime Minister of Britain and I have had a chance to talk together about world problems, much has happened. I am sure that in the next few days we can do much to strengthen the long-term bonds that have bound together the British Empire and my country. Our countries are very old friends indeed.
This is a very happy occasion, because of the fact that your Prime Minister and I are very old friends, a fact of which I am very proud. I expect to have, therefore, not only a very interesting and enjoyable visit here on your Island, but one which I hope will, and I am confident will, redound to the betterment of both our peoples because of the stronger friendships and understandings that are certain to come out of it.
Thank you very much for your warm welcome.
Note: The President's opening word "Governor" referred to Lieut. General Sir John Woodall, Governor of Bermuda.
