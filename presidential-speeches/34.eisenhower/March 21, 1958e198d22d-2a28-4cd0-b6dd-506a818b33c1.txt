Dwight D. Eisenhower
March 21, 1958

Citation Accompanying the Sylvanus Thayer Award Presented to Dr. Ernest O. Lawrence.
[Read in the President's name by Lt. Gen. Willis D. Crittenberger, USA ( Retired ) ]
I AM DELIGHTED to participate in a ceremony that links your name with that of the father of West Point, Sylvanus Thayer.
Founder and Director of the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California, you are the inventor of the cyclotron, recipient of the Nobel Prize, leader in the development and use of high energy accelerators.
Under your leadership, the Radiation Laboratory contributed materially to development of the electro-magnetic method of separating uranium isotopes and thereby greatly enhanced your nation's security.
As student of the atom, you have sought its beneficient application not only to physics--but to biology, medicine and technology.
Today the men of West Point pay tribute to your contributions to our nation and all mankind, and for your achievements as scientist and as a statesman of science.
It is my great privilege, on their behalf, to convey the gratitude of your colleagues and countrymen--and to present you with the Sylvanus Thayer Award of the Association of Graduates of the United States Military Academy.
Note: The President's flight to West Point was canceled because of inclement weather. The citation was telephoned to the office of the Superintendent of the Academy and was read by General Crittenberger, President of the Association of Graduates of the Academy, at a luncheon of the Association.
