Letter to William A. Greene, President, Crusade for Freedom.
[Released March 27, 1956. Dated March 23, 1956]
Dear Mr. Greene:
The captive European peoples behind the Iron Curtain-Poles, Czechoslovaks, Bulgarians, Rumanians, Albanians, and residents of the Baltic States--are constantly bombarded by Communist propaganda designed to break their will to resist and destroy their hope for a better future.
In the continuing work of combating such propaganda, Radio Free Europe, the radio arm of the Crusade for Freedom, plays a major and effective role. Day in and day out its broadcasts extend the hand of friendship and hope to the people behind the Curtain, assuring them that their plight has not been forgotten by the free world and fortifying their devotion to liberty.
To the National Committee for a Free Europe, I extend congratulations on this and the other valuable activities of the organization, with my best wishes for success in enlisting, through the Crusade for Freedom, the support of the American people. I am confident they will respond generously and thus forward this vital work for the cause of freedom and peace.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
