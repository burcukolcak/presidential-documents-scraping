Letter to the Reverend Edward L. R. Elson, Chairman, Three Hours Observance of Good Friday.
[Released March 29, 1956. Dated March 23, 1956]
Dear Dr. Elson:
To the individual Christian, Good Friday is an occasion for intensifying his faith and renewing his recognition of the worth of humility and sacrifice. But because it is a day which commemorates an event central to Christianity, it is of significance to all throughout the free world who strive to uphold the values of a civilization in which the Christian heritage is of immeasurable importance.
As in years past, therefore, this year's observance of Good Friday in the churches of Washington and of communities throughout the land will surely strengthen Americans in their endeavors to live as Christian citizens in their relationships with their fellow men. And in many nations, here and abroad, the observance will fortify the hearts of men and women of good will by deepening their understanding of those spiritual values which guide them in their quest for a just peace and for a better life for human beings everywhere on earth.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D, EISENHOWER
