Letter to Lindsay Warren Regarding His Retirement as Comptroller General of the United States
Dear Mr. Warren:
It is with a great deal of regret that I agree to the request in your letter to retire on April 30, 1954, as Comptroller General of the United States. It is unfortunate from every viewpoint that you are unable to complete your full term after thirteen and one-half years of outstanding service in that important position. Not only has your service been long, it has also embraced the period of tremendous responsibility in government incident to the conduct of the second World War, the postwar military and foreign aid programs, and the Korean conflict. However, I can certainly understand that it would be inadvisable to continue in this very demanding office against the advice of your doctors.
You have left a lasting mark on government in the great program of the General Accounting Office and can take deep pride in so vast a contribution to better, more efficient governmental operation.
I appreciate the fine cooperation you have given this Administration. Please accept my warm good wishes for a fully satisfying and happy retirement.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
