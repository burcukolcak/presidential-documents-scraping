March 31, 1958

Veto of Bill for the Relief of Shirley Leeke Kilpatrick.
To the United States Senate:
I return herewith, without my approval S. 2110, "for the relief of Shirley Leeke Kilpatrick."
On March 24, 1958, subsequent to the passage of this measure by the Congress, an adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident of the United States was granted the beneficiary by the Immigration and Naturalization Service pursuant to Section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. S. 2110 is therefore unnecessary.
