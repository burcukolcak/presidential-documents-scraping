I am most grateful for your thoughtful message.

Personally and on behalf of all our citizens I assure you of our deep appreciation. The monument will remain a symbol of the enduring friendship between our peoples.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

At the commemoration of our liberation 15 years ago and at the completion of the monument of our gratitude I should like once again to emphasize the moral and material support your country gave us in so ample measure during and after the war. Gladly I take this opportunity, Mr. President, to send you and the people of the United States of America, also on behalf of the people of The Netherlands, my very best wishes for a peaceful and prosperous future.
JULIANA
