Statement by the President Announcing the Forthcoming Visit of the Crown Prince and Princess of Japan.
AT THE TIME of Prime Minister Kishi's visit last January, I expressed the hope that the Crown Prince and Princess would be able to visit the United States during the Centennial year of Japanese-American relations. I am now happy to announce that their Imperial Highnesses have accepted my invitation, and will be in Washington from September 27 to September
They will be welcomed in the spirit of cordial friendship and mutual respect which characterizes relations between our two great nations.
