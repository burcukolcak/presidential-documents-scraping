Statement by the President Concerning the Removal of the Soldiers Stationed at Little Rock.
SINCE LAST SEPTEMBER the Federal Government has stationed soldiers at the Little Rock High School to prevent obstruction of the orders of the United States District Court.
Since the summer recess starts at the Central High School on May twenty-eighth, and since there will be no further present need for guardsmen, I have directed that they be released on May twenty-ninth.
Following that date I trust that state and local officials and citizens will assume their full responsibility and duty for seeing that the orders of the federal Court are not obstructed. The faithful execution of this responsibility will make it unnecessary for the federal Government to act further to preserve the integrity of our judicial processes.
