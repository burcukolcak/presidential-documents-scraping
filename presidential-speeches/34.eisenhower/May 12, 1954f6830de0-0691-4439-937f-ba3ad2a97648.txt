Dwight D. Eisenhower
May 12, 1954

Statement by the President on the Death of Senator Hoey of North Carolina.
I HAVE JUST LEARNED of the sudden death of the senior Senator from North Carolina, Clyde R. Hoey. A member of the House of Representatives, a former Governor of his State, and a member of the United States Senate since 1945, Senator Hoey has a long and distinguished record of public service to his State and nation. Mrs. Eisenhower joins with me in extending our sympathy to his family and to his many friends.
