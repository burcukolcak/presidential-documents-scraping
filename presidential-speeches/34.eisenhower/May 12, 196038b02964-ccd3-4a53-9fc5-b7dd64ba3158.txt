Statement by the President on the Death of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.
THE PASSING of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., is a great loss to our nation. Life in America and, indeed throughout the world, has been enriched by his leadership in the planning and accomplishment of many programs for the public welfare. These, in their enduring contribution to the growth and progress of our country and to the health and welfare of millions elsewhere, constitute a noble monument to his name and work. His place in our history will be both prominent and permanent.
Through the years I came to know Mr. Rockefeller as a churchman, philanthropist and a dedicated citizen. In every aspect of his life, he won my deep admiration. I share with millions a feeling of profound regret in the death of such a distinguished American.
