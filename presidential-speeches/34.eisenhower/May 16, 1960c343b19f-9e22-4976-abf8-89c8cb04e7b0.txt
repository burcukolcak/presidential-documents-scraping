Message to the Congress Transmitting the Civil Service Commission's First Report Under the Government Employees Training Act.
[ Released May 16, 1960. Dated May 14, 1960 ]
To the Congress of the United States:
The Government Employees Training Act ( P.L. 85-507) directs the Civil Service Commission to submit annually to the President for his approval and transmittal to the Congress a report with respect to the training of employees of the Government under the authority of the Act. I am transmitting to you with this letter the Commission's report entitled, "Employee Training for Better Public Service."
It is my firm conviction that training has long been essential for the successful operation of Federal agencies. Today's demands, however, bring a new urgency to training, especially for our career managers. I have, therefore, recently asked all agency heads to strengthen their programs for the selection, development, and training of these key officials. This directive is in addition to that issued in 1955 which supported all types of training.
The action of the Congress in broadening authority to train Federal employees was a healthy and progressive move. The Commission's report shows that Federal officials have made intelligent use of their authority under the Act and that it has helped to meet an urgent need. I was particularly interested in the Commission's comments on "The Future," which point out two important areas needing improvement--Planning, and Budgeting and Scheduling for Training Activities.
The Commission's report is encouraging and its suggestions to the agencies sound. A good beginning has been made under the authority granted by the Congress.
