Letter to General Wladyslaw Anders of the Polish Armed Forces in Exile on Commemoration of the Battle of Monte Cassino.
[Released May 17, 1954. Dated May 7, 1954]
Dear General Anders:
I am happy to write in connection with your recent letter on plans to commemorate the battle of Monte Cassino.
That famous battle has come to represent the heroism and sacrifices of the Polish soldiers in the past war against the forces of totalitarianism in Europe. It will stand through the years as a symbol of the Polish nation's inextinguishable love of freedom.
Today, the Polish people are again faced with foreign oppression and are meeting the test with the same qualities of heroism. We in America are convinced that this courage and faith in freedom will not be in vain and that the cause of liberty and justice will prevail, as it did at Monte Cassino ten years ago.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Lieutenant General W. Anders, C.B.
