Letter to Secretary Strauss on the Establishment of an Inter-Agency Textile Committee.
[Released May 19, 1959. Dated May 18, 1959]
Dear Lewis:
I have given considerable thought to the formation of an inter-agency textile committee, such as recommended by the Special Subcommittee of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, headed by Senator Pastore. This proposal has also been recommended to me by Senator Saltonstall and Governors Powell, Del Sesto and Furcolo.
I think an ad hoc committee, chaired by the Department of Commerce, would be appropriate. The committee would address itself to a number of important problems affecting the textile industry. The committee should be composed of Assistant Secretaries or men of equivalent rank from the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Labor, State, and Treasury, and from the Council on Foreign Economic Policy. The committee should report informally to the Secretary of Commerce. Studies should be undertaken soon so that the committee could give its counsel to the Secretary of Commerce before the 1960 session of the Congress.
Please undertake the formation of this group as soon as you conveniently can.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
