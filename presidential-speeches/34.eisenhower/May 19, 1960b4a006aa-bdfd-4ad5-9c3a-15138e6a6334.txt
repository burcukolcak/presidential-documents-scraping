Remarks Upon Arrival at Portela Airport, Lisbon.
MR. PRESIDENT, I thank you most sincerely for your warm words of welcome.
It is 9 years since I last visited this lovely land. It was a January day of beautiful sunshine, and I recall very vividly the opportunity I had to see from the vantage point of the Edward VII Park the lovely city of Lisbon.
Now I am particularly fortunate that I come back when you are celebrating your Fifth Centenary of Prince Henry the Great Navigator. His studies and leadership were the very inspiration for the great age of exploration. And the American people join your people in the salute to this great gentleman, a man whose genius did so much to enrich both our country and yours.
Finally, I come back to tell you that there are no great problems between the United States and Portugal. Our entire history since the birth of my Nation has been that of friendship, and in friendship we are members of the United Nations; we are both members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an alliance that seeks only security and peace. And our two nations, despite obstacles set in our paths by others, will continue the march towards peace and freedom.
Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 9:58 a.m. He was met by President Americo Deus Rodriques Thomaz, Dr. C. Arreiro de Sreitas, Portuguese Chief of Protocol, and U.S. Ambassador C. Burke Elbrick.
