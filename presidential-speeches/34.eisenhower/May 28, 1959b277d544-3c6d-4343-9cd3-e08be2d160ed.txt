Statement by the President Following a Meeting With Paul F. Foster, U.S. Representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
I HAVE just conferred with Paul F. Foster, the new United States Representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria. The acceptance of this important assignment after a lifetime of public service is characteristic of the devotion to duty which has marked the career of this outstanding American.
I know that Admiral Foster will well represent the United States in Vienna and will continue to manifest those qualities of leadership which are so necessary in the International Agency.
As one of the principal supporters of the "atoms-for-peace" program, Paul Foster has notably furthered the cause of peace and worldwide understanding.
I told Under Secretary of State Douglas Dillon and Mr. John A. McCone, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, who accompanied Paul Foster, that I attached the highest importance to the continued growth and development of the Agency and, accordingly, I instructed them to provide complete support to the new United States Representative.
We all should be gratified that the United States will be represented in the Agency by a man such as Paul Foster, and I wish him Godspeed in his new duties.
