Statement by the President on Authorizing Food and Other Relief for the Hungarian People.
ALL AMERICA PAYS TRIBUTE in these troubled days to the courage and sacrifices of the Hungarian people in their determination to secure freedom. In struggling to obtain this goal for their country, the Hungarians are undergoing grave physical hardships and privations.
In order to help the Hungarian people in this hour of need, I am authorizing immediately an initial allocation of $20 million from the funds appropriated by the Congress for emergency use, to be employed for food and other urgent relief necessary for the alleviation of their sufferings.
