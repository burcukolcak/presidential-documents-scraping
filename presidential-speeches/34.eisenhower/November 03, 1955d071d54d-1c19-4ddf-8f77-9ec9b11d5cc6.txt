His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I Emperor of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa
The people of the United States join with me today in extending to Your Imperial Majesty heartiest congratulations on the 25th Anniversary of your accession to the throne and in sending best wishes for your continued health and happiness.
On this significant occasion it is gratifying to see the fulfillment of the confidence expressed by this Government at the time of your coronation. Under your reign the traditional ties of friendship and mutual understanding between our two countries, as well as the sympathetic cooperation of our peoples, have indeed been strengthened, and I am confident that the mutual aspirations of our peoples will further enhance this relationship in the years to come.
