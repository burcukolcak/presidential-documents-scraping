Dwight D. Eisenhower
November 14, 1955

Remarks Upon Arrival in Lincoln Square, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
Mr. Burgess, Mrs. Weaver, Patty, and my future permanent neighbors, I hope:
Of course, Mrs. Eisenhower and I feel deeply honored that you should turn out today to welcome us to this area where we expect to make our home and which has been so long a part of the Eisenhower family's life.

In fact, I think that my wife decided back in 1918, before many of you were born, that this was going to be our home upon retirement, but she did not give me her decision until later than that.
In any event, I am just as delighted as she that you are the people who are going to be our neighbors, God willing.
And to each of you who has come out this morning, to each of the school children who along the way have waved these little flags or his hand, or called a greeting, our very deep thanks. We are truly grateful to all of you.

Goodbye.
Note: The President spoke at 1:00 p.m. His opening words "Mr. Burgess, Mrs. Weaver, Patty" referred to William G. Weaver, Burgess of Gettysburg, Mrs. Weaver, and their daughter, Patricia.
