Letter to Mrs. Martin P. Durkin on the Death of Her Husband.
Dear Mrs. Durkin:
The word of Martin's death is deeply distressing to me, as it must be to all those who had the privilege of friendship and association with him over the years. His career was marked by an unfaltering devotion to high ideals and to the service of his fellowmen. He will be greatly missed by those who knew him.
Martin's dedication to his religious faith and to the welfare of his fellowman made his life both exemplary and purposeful. He was a good and distinguished American.
Mrs. Eisenhower joins me in extending our deepest sympathy to you and your family.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Durkin served as Secretary of Labor from January 21 to September 10, 1953.
