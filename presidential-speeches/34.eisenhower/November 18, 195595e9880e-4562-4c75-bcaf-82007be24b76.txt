Message to the Sultan of Morocco on the Anniversary of His Accession to the Throne.
His Cherifian Majesty Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef Sultan of Morocco, Rabat
On the anniversary of your accession to the Throne, it gives me pleasure to send to Your Majesty and to the people of Morocco greetings from the people of the United States. It also gives me particular satisfaction to recall the good and friendly relations between your country and mine which began in the early days of our own history.
May your reign open new vistas for that community of purpose which has contributed so much to the greatness of Morocco, and restore the peace and prosperity which the United States so deeply desires for all the inhabitants of your country.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The Sultan's reply, released on November 30, follows:
We are very touched by the noble sentiments that you have kindly expressed in the name of the people of the United States. We are happy to note that the time-honored friendship of our two countries remains intact. We hope to see established in Morocco an era of liberty, that liberty for which your people and you yourself have never ceased to work and which is the best guarantee of a durable peace.
