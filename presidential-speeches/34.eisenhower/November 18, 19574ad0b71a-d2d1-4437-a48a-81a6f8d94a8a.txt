Dwight D. Eisenhower
November 18, 1957

Statement by the President: Equal Opportunity Day.
ONE OF THE ringing pronouncements of our American Declaration is that "all men are created equal."
Today, when our national strength is being tested at every point, this tradition takes on added urgency. Our nation's economy can ill afford to waste the talent and abilities of any individual because of discrimination against him on the basis of his race, his color, or his creed. Every citizen who helps to make legal and economic equality a living fact, is helping America.
November nineteenth, the anniversary of the Gettysburg Address, has been designated Equal Opportunity Day. In Lincoln's words, "it is altogether fitting and proper" that we should use this day to rededicate ourselves tc the firm establishment of equal opportunity for all. Let every citizen of the United States, whether an employer or employee, farmer or businessman, join in the effort to abolish all artificial discrimination which hinders the right of each American to advance in accordance with his merits as a human being and his capacity for productive work.
