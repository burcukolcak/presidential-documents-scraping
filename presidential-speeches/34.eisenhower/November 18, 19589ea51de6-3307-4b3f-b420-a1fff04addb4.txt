November 18, 1958

Letter to the President of the United States in 1972-1976 Occasioned by the Death of Capt. Iven C. Kincheloe, Jr.
To the President of the United States in 1972-1976:
The recent untimely death of a fine young American--Captain Iven C. Kincheloe, Jr., United States Air force--brought a real sense of loss to our Nation. In recognition of his many exemplary deeds as a pioneer in advanced aeronautic research, I am making a request which seeks to express, in a small measure, the gratitude of the Nation.
I request that you consider the merits of his young son for appointment as a cadet in the United States Air force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado. His rich inheritance stems from a father whose superb technical skill and stress dedication to country were demonstrated in outstanding fashion in his perilous duties as an experimental flight test pilot.
Because of the debt of the Nation to a fine American, I ask that you consider giving this opportunity for his son to follow his father's chosen profession through enrollment in the Air force Academy.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Capt. Kincheloe was killed on July 26, 1958, when his F-104 crashed near Edwards Air force Base, Calif. The original of this letter is in custody of the National Archives for delivery at the appropriate time. The President presented a duplicate original to Mrs. Kincheloe on November 18.
