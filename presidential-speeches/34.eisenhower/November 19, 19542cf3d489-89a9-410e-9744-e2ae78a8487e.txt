Dwight D. Eisenhower
November 19, 1954

Remarks to Executive Committee of the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce and Directors of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.
I HOPE the acceptance of this makes me a public supporter of your Creed.
It is good to see all of you here, and I am particularly happy to know that this is a combined meeting of Canadian and American businessmen, senior and junior.
It is a great advance, I think, when civilians not only of any one country but of more than one country meet to make certain that their respective countries are going--industrially, economically, politically--in the direction that they believe to be correct.
If your meetings are conducted in the spirit of this code that we just heard read, I certainly have no fear for the future of the North American Continent.
Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke in the Cabinet Room at 9:15 a.m., following the presentation to him of a plaque inscribed with the Creed of the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce.
