Letter to Dr. Theodore von Karman, Chairman, NATO Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development.
Dear Dr. von Karman:
As NATO's Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development meets in Washington today to begin its Seventh General Assembly, I wish it were possible for me to greet you in person. Since I cannot, I hope you will convey my warm welcome to all who are participating.
In conducting joint discussion and scientific exchange in aeronautical research and development, your organization is engaged in a work which becomes more important with each passing year to the safeguarding of peace and security. Moreover, it serves as a model for others in practical and productive cooperation for the benefit of the whole NATO community.
My best wishes to all for a highly successful meeting.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
