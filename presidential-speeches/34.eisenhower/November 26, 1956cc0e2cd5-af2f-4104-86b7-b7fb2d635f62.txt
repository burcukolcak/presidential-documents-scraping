Remarks to a Group of Hungarian Refugees.
I WANT to tell you that our country feels privileged in inviting you to the United States. We hope you have found nothing but courtesy and hospitality since you arrived.
The sufferings your people have gone through recently have served, from our standpoint at least, one good purpose--to make stronger the friendship we have always felt for your country and to bring us closer together in our hearts.
Recently, of course, the news from your country was particularly disturbing and shocking. Many thousands of your people have been taken from their homes by force and sent into exile at bayonet point.
This is the ultimate tyranny can do to a people. I want to tell you that this country not only resents it deeply but we will never agree that this is the kind of thing one country may do in justice to another.
We shall continue our efforts to try to help those who are coming out and, as you know, we have offered to send in supplies of food and medicine and other assistance to help those still in the country. We will continue to do that and we will be very, very glad to do so. And so, finally for your courtesy in coming down from Camp Kilmer to see me and to give me a chance to talk to you directly, my very grateful thanks.
Note: The President spoke in his office at the White House at 9 a. m.
