Statement by the President on Observance of Safe Driving Day.
ALL OVER the United States tomorrow, Americans will join in a great National effort to save lives. The occasion will be the second nationwide "S-D Day"--Safe Driving Day.

The immediate objective of S-D Day is to have twenty-four hours without a single traffic accident. The long-range, and more important objective is to impress upon all of us the necessity for safe driving and safe walking every day of the year.
The need is obvious and urgent. Last year, an American man, woman or child was killed in traffic every fifteen minutes. Someone was injured every twenty-five seconds. And, this year, the record is worse: More people are dying; more are injured and crippled.
This tragic situation concerns every State, every community, every American. Actual experience has demonstrated that traffic accidents can be greatly reduced by proven, year-round safety programs, when these programs have year-round public support.
S-D Day is directed to the development of that kind of support. Literally millions of Americans are participating, through local, state and national organizations, cooperating with the President's Committee for Traffic Safety. This is a volunteer group, appointed by me, to stimulate permanent, effective safety programs in every community.
We know that we cannot solve the traffic accident problem in one day, but we can--and must--start doing a better job. I appeal, then, to every American to help demonstrate tomorrow that we can--by our own, personal efforts--reduce accidents on our streets and highways. Having shown that we can do so on one day, let us all, as good citizens, accept our responsibility for safety every day in the future.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
