Dwight D. Eisenhower
October 01, 1956

Remarks Upon Arrival in Lexington, Kentucky.
THANK YOU very much. All of us have heard of Kentucky hospitality. I can't tell you how deeply touched Mrs. Eisenhower and I are by your kindness in coming out to greet us here in Lexington. We were particularly touched by the fact that your Governor himself took the trouble to come out to the airport and greeted us as we got off the plane.
But to all of you our thanks go out for the cordiality of your welcome.
I should say one word before I leave here. At the bottom of the steps I met three youngsters who had on ribbons called "First Voters."
I can't tell you how happy I am that there is another State that has joined the ranks of those that said, "If you're old enough to fight you're old enough to vote."
Thank you very much and goodbye.
Note: The President spoke at the airport at 3:15 p.m.
