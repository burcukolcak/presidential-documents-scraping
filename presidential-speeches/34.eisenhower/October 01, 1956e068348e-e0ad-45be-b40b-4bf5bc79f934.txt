Dwight D. Eisenhower
October 01, 1956

Remarks to the Sales Executives Club and the Chamber of Commerce, Cleveland, Ohio.
All of the people seated at the head table, and all the rest of the guests, and my Fellow Americans:
You can well guess that my first statement must be: I am delighted to be here.
I come to a meeting that I really didn't know I was scheduled, but when I can see this many Americans exhibiting this kind of enthusiasm, I get a lift that can well start me off on something that I would have to get some help to stop.
I do assure you, for the cordiality of your welcome, I am truly grateful. As you know, I am going to make an address very soon out here on the Square. I am not certain how much time I have, but I do say this:
There is no ambition any American has that is greater than the hope that he might serve America usefully, particularly when he sees a cross-section of America represented in such fine style as this, here at this meeting. If I have in my whole lifetime done anything at all to repay what America has done for me, for my family, I shall never to the end of my days have one single regret for anything.
Thank you very much for asking me in. It has been a great privilege, I assure you.
Note: The President spoke at the Cleveland Hotel at 11:55 a. m.
