Statement by the President: The Jewish High Holy Days.
GREETINGS to my fellow citizens of Jewish faith as they enter the season of their High Holy Days.
The teachings of your ancient belief have long sustained you and strengthened the communities in which you live. By constant repetition-in word and deed--of the commandments of God, you have nourished the noblest principles of mankind.
The demands of justice, the plea for mercy, the rights and the responsibilities of each individual; these should be uppermost in our thoughts at home and at work, when we sleep and when we awake.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
