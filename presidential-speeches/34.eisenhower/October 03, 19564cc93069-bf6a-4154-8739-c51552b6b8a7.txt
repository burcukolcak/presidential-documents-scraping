Letter to Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., the President's Personal Representative at the Pulaski Day Parade in New York.
[ Released October 3, 1956. Dated September 19, 1956 ]
Dear Cabot:
I understand that you have agreed to act as my personal representative at the Pulaski Day Parade to be held in New York on October seventh. I am sure you agree with me that it is an honor for all Americans to join in observation of the anniversary of the death of the distinguished Pole who laid down his life in the cause of our liberty some one hundred and seventy-seven years ago. His contribution to our freedom will never be forgotten.
Thank you for acting for me on this important occasion.
With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
