Message Recorded for the Dedication at Indiana University of a Tablet Honoring Ernie Pyle.
TO ALL of you participating in the ceremony honoring Ernie Pyle, I am delighted to send my warmest greetings.
I met Ernie Pyle in the midst of war and counted him my good friend. I remember him as a man of small stature, of high courage, of great understanding and love for his fellows. I remember him as a reporter who won the devotion of millions merely by writing the familiar everyday facts of life as he saw them.
Both in war and in peace, Ernie Pyle conceived it his duty to write the truth with the vigor of simplicity. His name is a symbol of integrity in his profession, and--for all citizens--a living testimony to patriotism. I am proud to join in this testimonial to him by so many of his colleagues.
Note: The ceremony at Indiana University, where a bronze tablet was dedicated to the memory of Ernie Pyle by the Sigma Delta Chi fraternity, was held in conjunction with the observance of National Newspaper Week.
