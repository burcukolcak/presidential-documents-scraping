Message to the Newspaperboys of America.
To the Newspaperboys of America:
In appreciation of your faithful service to the public, your friends set aside one day each year in your honor. This year, on Saturday, October fifth, I am happy to join them again in paying tribute to your enterprise.
Delivering papers has been part of the early chapters of some of America's greatest success stories. From this youthful experience, requiring the industry and loyalty of each newspaperboy-and girl--I know you are gaining a sense of responsibility which will serve you in good stead for the rest of your lives.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
