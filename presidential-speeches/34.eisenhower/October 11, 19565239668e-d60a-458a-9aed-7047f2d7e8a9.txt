Statement by the President Concerning Rate Reductions by Western Railroads in Aid of Drought Disaster Areas.
WILLIAM T. FARICY, President of the Association of American Railroads, reported to me this afternoon that, pursuant to my request made on the western railroads to assist farm and ranch people in drought areas during the present difficult period, the western railroads had authorized him to say that they are proceeding to put into effect on Saturday, October 13th a 50% reduction in rates on hay in carloads.
The reduction will apply from all western states to the drought disaster areas in Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah. In addition, the railroads are arranging, effective at the same time, to establish rates for outbound movement of livestock from the drought areas to feeding grounds in Western Territory which will permit free return transportation to originating points.
I know that I speak for our people, especially those in the areas affected, in saying that all of us are deeply grateful to our Railways for this public spirited and prompt action.
