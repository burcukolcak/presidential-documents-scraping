Remarks to a Group of NATO Naval Chaplains.
IT'S GOOD to see you. I hope you have a successful meeting and an enjoyable one also.
When you go back, I think it's safe to say that in each of your countries I have some friends. I would like them to know, if you get an opportunity, that I still think of them and I send them warm greetings and best wishes.
I think that in the NATO organization is one of the greatest hopes for peace as long as we must carry arms on our shoulders to insure our national security. The United Nations is a very great organism, too, and I think all of us support it with our entire efforts and our hearts and minds, but as long as we do have to get together and bind ourselves together, NATO is a tremendous thing--SEATO too--but NATO is the largest.
And we must share the burdens together. We must do more in promoting a common understanding. We are defending its spiritual values, not merely property and lives, and even our families. It's a way of life in which we believe, based on the brotherhood of man. We have got to use everything, including all of you people--religious leaders--to bind ourselves closer together during these dangerous times.
We must have faith not to get hysterical, and we must not get complacent. And I think that you people not only can but I know you are doing good work in this regard. NATO is something that finally ought to be remembered and respected in our several national histories as much as our own flags and declarations of independence and everything else.
Note: The President spoke to a from fourteen countries, at the group of NATO Naval Chaplains, White House at 11:15 a. m.
