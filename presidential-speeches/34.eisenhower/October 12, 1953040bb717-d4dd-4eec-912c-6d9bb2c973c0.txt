Statement Following Conference With Madame Pandit, President of the United Nations General Assembly.
MADAME PANDIT called upon the President and the Secretary of State in her capacity of President of the United Nations General Assembly. Among other things she explained the tasks still before the General Assembly in relation to peace in Korea and the performance of the Armistice Agreement relative to prisoners of war.
The President expressed his great appreciation of the fact that the Government of India had been willing in the interest of peace to assume the difficult role of Chairman of the Neutral Nations Commission, a role inherently subject to criticism from both sides. The President and the Secretary of State told Madame Pandit that they would do everything possible to facilitate the work of the United Nations Command and the Neutral Nations Commission. The President particularly mentioned the reports he had received of the exemplary conduct of the Indian troops in the discharge of their duties as custodians of the prisoners of war who have elected not to be repatriated.
The President reaffirmed his faith in the United Nations and his determination that the United States should cooperate fully with it in all matters conducive to peace and justice in the world.
