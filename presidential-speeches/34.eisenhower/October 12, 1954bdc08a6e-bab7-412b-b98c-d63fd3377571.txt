Dwight D. Eisenhower
October 12, 1954

Remarks to Members of the Olympic Committee, Denver, Colorado.
Mr. Wilson:
Last April the Congress authorized the President to proclaim October 16 as Olympic Day. I signed the Proclamation last week, and I give to you now a copy of the Proclamation that proclaims that day as Olympic Day.
In doing so, I want to give my word of commendation to you people who are doing so much to promote the success of the American Olympic Team, and the Olympic games in general. I thoroughly believe that the participation in athletics is one of the greatest influences in the development of our youth; and I thoroughly believe in the Olympics as one of the means and methods by which some understanding of fair play and justice can be developed among nations.
So, to you, good luck, and especially good luck in getting all the support from our people, not only athletic-wise but financial-wise, to make the games a huge success.
I believe in what you are doing. Good luck to you, and to your team.
Note: The President spoke on the steps of the Headquarters Building, Lowry Air Force Base, at 10:20 a.m. His opening words "Mr. Wilson" referred to Kenneth L. Wilson, President of the U.S. Olympic Committee. For the text of the Olympic Day proclamation see title 3 of the Code of Federal Regulations (1954 Supp., p. 33).
