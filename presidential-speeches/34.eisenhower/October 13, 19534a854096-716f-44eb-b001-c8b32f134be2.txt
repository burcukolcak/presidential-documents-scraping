Dwight D. Eisenhower
October 13, 1953

Remarks in Response to Birthday Greetings at Hershey, Pennsylvania.
GOOD EVENING, my friends--and thank you a lot for the cordiality of your welcome.
Mrs. Eisenhower and I have many reasons to be thankful that we were able to make this trip today. There may have been several thousand, or maybe many tens of thousands of reasons for the smiles we have encountered on the road, and here. And I must say to you, never in my life have I heard so many people sing "Happy Birthday."
I don't mean to be too partisan, but I am glad that there are this many Republicans in this region.
Thank you a lot.
Note: The President spoke in the Stadium at 6:20 p.m. He went to Hershey to participate in a rally of Pennsylvania Republicans on the eve of his birthday. See also Item 212.
