President of the Republic of Haiti

Port-Au-Prince, Haiti
I would like to express the deepest sympathy of the American people to the people of Haiti at this time when reports have been received of a disastrous hurricane which has passed over the western part of your country. I am informed that Ambassador Davis has already arranged for assistance from the United States Armed Forces to survey the damaged area and lend all possible help. I trust you will inform him of any additional ways in which the United States can render aid. I send heartfelt wishes for the safety of the Haitian people and Your Excellency's own welfare.
