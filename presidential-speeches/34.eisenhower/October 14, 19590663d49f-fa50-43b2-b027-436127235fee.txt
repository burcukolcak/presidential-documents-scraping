Statement by the President Regarding Appointment of Robert Cutler as U.S. Executive Director of the Inter-American Development Bank.
THE SOUND organization and effective operation of this new international institution is of the greatest importance to the United States and the other nations of the Western Hemisphere.
Mr. Cutler, as Executive Director for the United States, will bring to the Inter-American Development Bank recognized competence and wide experience in economic and financial matters, supplemented by experience gained during his service in the Federal Government in which he was in continuous close contact with this Nation's foreign affairs.
My appointment of Mr. Cutler to this position evidences my deep personal interest in the successful carrying out by the Inter-American Bank of its important mission.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House release issued on the day the United States became a member of the Bank as authorized by Public Law 86-147 (73 Stat. 299). The release further stated that Secretary of the Treasury Robert B. Anderson would be appointed Governor of the Bank and that Under Secretary of State C. Douglas Dillon would be named alternate Governor.
For the special message to Congress concerning the Bank, see Item 98. A report by Dr. Milton S. Eisenhower on U.S.-Latin American relations, strongly urging establishment of the Bank, was released by the White House on January 4, 1959.
