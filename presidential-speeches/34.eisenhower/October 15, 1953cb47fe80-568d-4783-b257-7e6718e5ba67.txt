Dwight D. Eisenhower
October 15, 1953

Remarks at Willard, Ohio
My friends:
You know I was raised in a place where you had to shout out loud in order to be heard a long ways, but I am not sure I can shout loud enough to reach way down there where those youngsters are and whom I would very much like to see.
When I was invited to come to Defiance College, one reason I wanted to do it was because I learned that this was the 150th year since Ohio's birth as a State. So I am here today, in this crowd, to pay my tribute, through you, to this great Commonwealth, and to tell you that everything that your Government can do to bring peace and decency in this world is being done.
Now, there are many kinds of problems that beset us in this world today, but every one of them is overshadowed by this: can we have a world of decency, justice, and peace, or must we always be fearful that war is just around the corner?
I believe that America can bring about a situation in which we can have peace. That is what we are working for.
So, as I bring you greetings today, I ask you one thing: to study this whole problem yourselves, to stand behind reasonable, decent proposals in the maintaining of strength, in the keeping of our peaceful relations with others, but retaining above all things our position of self-respect and decency in the world.
Now I am sorry that I can't shout any louder, but I do want to say to every one of you: I am so honored that you came down to let me say "Good morning, how are you," that I want to thank you here and now for the very great privilege you have given me.
Thank you.
Note: The President spoke at 9:55 a.m. when the train made a stop on the way to Defiance.
