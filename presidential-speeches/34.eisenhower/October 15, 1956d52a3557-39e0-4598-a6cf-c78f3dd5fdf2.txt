Statement by the President Concerning the Medical Care Program for Dependents of Members of the Uniformed Services.
I HAVE TODAY approved with great satisfaction the directive under which the Military Dependents' Medical Care program will operate beginning December 7, 1956. Prior to this time at least 40 percent of our service families were unable to receive adequate medical care from the Government. This important improvement assures hospital care at all times to the wives and children of active duty personnel. It removes one of the greatest sources of worry to our servicemen and servicewomen around the world.
A significant new feature of this law authorizes the use of civilian hospitals and facilities for the immediate families of active duty servicemen.
The cost to a service family for hospitalization in any facility, civilian or military, will be limited to a payment of either $25.00 or an amount equivalent to the subsistence charge of $1.75 per day, whichever is the greater. For this charge, all hospital services and doctors' fees for the period of hospitalization are covered.
This program also continues the provision for medical care for the dependents of both active and retired personnel in military facilities on a space available basis.
I have been personally interested in this important program since its inception. I feel strongly that this important measure will have a far-reaching effect on service morale at home or on our widely flung posts, ships and bases around the world and thus effectively strengthens the defense of our country.
Note: In his opening sentence the President refers to joint regulations of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (32 CFR Part 56) under the Dependent's Medical Care Act.
