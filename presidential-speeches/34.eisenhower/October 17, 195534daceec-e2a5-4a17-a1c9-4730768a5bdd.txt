Proclamation 3118â€”Farm-City Week

Whereasthe increased efficiency of the farmers of our Nation, achieved through research and through their initiative, ability, and energy, makes it possible for fewer and fewer farmers to produce an increasing abundance of food and fiber; and
Whereasthe productivity of the farms and of urban labor and business continues to provide the food, the tools, the services, and the goods that afford our citizens the highest standards of living in the world; and
Whereasit is desirable that those who work on the farms and those who work in the cities develop greater understanding of their mutual problems and interdependence in our closely-knit economy; and
Whereassuch understanding will be advantageous to all of us in the building of a stronger and a more prosperous free Nation:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period from October 23 through October 29, 1955, as Farm-City Week, and I ask the people throughout the country to participate fully in the observance of that week. I urge such observance as evidence of our appreciation of all those on the farms and in the cities of this Nation who have worked so well in providing us with the food and goods that we need and enjoy.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this seventeenth day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eightieth.
