Statement by the President on Observance of Farm-City Week.
I HAVE proclaimed October 23-29 as Farm-City Week for 1955 in response to requests from the numerous farm, service, and business organizations and of private industry.

It is a source of deep satisfaction to me personally that there is such broad interest in a national observance dedicated to strengthening ties and increasing understanding between the people of our farms and cities. Farmers and city dwellers alike recognize the interdependence of all of us in our free society. Our reliance upon each other is so much a part of our established daily living that we have come to accept it as a matter of course.
Farm-City Week presents an opportunity for public recognition of the vital role agriculture plays in providing an abundance of food and fiber for our fast-growing population. At the same time, this observance will focus attention upon the great contribution of labor, industry and commerce to the increasing efficiency of agriculture and to the continuing development of our total economy.
I strongly urge full participation in Farm-City Week activities as a national tribute to this important and effective partnership.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
