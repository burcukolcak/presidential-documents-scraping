Statement by the President on the Forthcoming Visit of Prime Minister Macmillan.
I WELCOME the visit of the British Prime Minister to Washington next week. It will provide an opportunity for me for useful discussions with an old and trusted friend. Mr. Macmillan's visit reflects the practice of free countries to consult as often as circumstances require. I hope that there will soon be occasions when I and my colleagues can meet with leaders of other free countries associated with us for similar discussions.
