Remarks of Welcome to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and H. R. H. the Prince Philip at the Washington National Airport.
YOUR MAJESTY, I know that I speak for every citizen of this country when I bid you and the Prince Philip a warm welcome to this country and to its Capital.
We have eagerly looked forward to your visit. We hope that you will find it agreeable and enjoyable, just as we will take great pleasure in it.
But even more than the pleasure that your visit brings us, we are conscious of its importance, because of its effect on strengthening the ties of friendship that bind our two countries together. Those ties have grown up in periods of tranquility and peace. They have been tested in the crucible of war when we have fought side by side to defend the values we hold dear.
So you can understand that this visit--which cannot fail to strengthen those ties--is to us something of the most tremendous importance because we thoroughly believe that in the warmer, closer, stronger cooperation between your country and ours lies the best hope for the security and peace of the world.
Thank you very much for coming to us.
