Proclamation 3120—National Day of Prayer, 1955

Whereasall of those whom we have revered as leaders throughout our history have been wont to turn to Almighty God in thanks for His providence and in suppliance for His guidance; and
Whereasit is fitting that we of this generation, who are the heirs of their handiwork, should emulate those inspired builders of our Nation and should turn our hearts and minds to things spiritual; and
Whereas, recognizing that prayer has been a vital force in the growth and development of our country, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved on April 17, 1952, provided that the President should set aside and proclaim a suitable day each year, other than a Sunday, as a National Day of Prayer, on which the people of the United States might turn to God in prayer and meditation:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, the twenty-sixth day of October, 1955, as a National Day of Prayer; and I ask each of our people on that day wherever he may be—at church, home, factory, or office—to pray particularly for God's blessing upon the councils of those who labor for increased international understanding, and upon the efforts of all men who strive for a just and lasting peace.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this eighteenth day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eightieth.


DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
