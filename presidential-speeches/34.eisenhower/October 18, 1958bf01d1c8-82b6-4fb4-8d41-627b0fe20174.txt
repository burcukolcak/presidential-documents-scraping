Message to the United States Forces Withdrawing from Lebanon.
[ Recorded on tape ]
THIS is the President.
Three months ago I spoke to you as you undertook the important task of helping Lebanon to maintain its independence. Your mission has now been performed.
You have written a new and honorable chapter in the history of America's dedication to freedom.

Let us recall what happened.
A small nation was imperiled by outside influences. In its moment of trial, Lebanon appealed to us for help. We promptly responded to meet the need. That need was met, and met peacefully. The United Nations also acted to strengthen the defense of Lebanon, and, as a result of your presence and of that action of the United Nations, the need is past and you are now withdrawing.

Two great lessons have been taught.
First, the United States is a friend to those who wish to live their own lives in freedom. We are not deterred by threats or abuse from giving needed help.
Second, the United States never seeks to turn the necessities of others into gains for itself.
I pledged to you, as you went forward, that as soon as the independence of Lebanon seemed secure, you would be immediately withdrawn. That pledge is now being redeemed.
The United States has no aggressive ambitions. We have no desire to impose our will upon others. Just as we responded rapidly to the call for help, so we are responding rapidly to the ending of the need for help.
World order, and the independence of small nations everywhere, are more secure both because of your going to Lebanon and because of your now leaving Lebanon.
As you return to your regular duties, I express the pride of all America in the way you have performed your duties. You have conducted yourselves in an exemplary way that assured you a friendly reception from the Lebanese authorities and people. You have served a noble cause in the best tradition of American servicemen.
On behalf of the American people--thank you.
