Statement by the President on the Death of William L. Hutcheson.
THE COUNTRY has lost an outstanding citizen and labor one of its most universally respected leaders in the passing of William L. Hutcheson. Through his thirty-six years as President of the Carpenters' Union, he had the esteem of both the rank and file and management. His long and vigorous service on behalf of the many thousands of workers in his organization was matched by his devotion to his country. He was a true American.
