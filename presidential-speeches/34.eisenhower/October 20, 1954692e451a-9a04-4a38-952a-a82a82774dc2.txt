Remarks at the Governor Lodge Birthday Celebration in Hartford.
Governor Lodge, ladies and gentlemen:
After that introduction, my natural question is, Well, whose birthday is this, anyway? I thought I came up here to tell you a little bit of what a great Governor you had. I never, I think, said before, "Happy Birthday" to anyone in front of such a big crowd. And I can't sing Happy Birthday, so I have to say the words.
But I do suggest this one thought. Of course, I am astonished that Governor Lodge is 51. He looked to me 41. But no matter how long he lives, something has been given him today that will be far more valuable to him and his family than will any present of gold or silver or anything else of material kind that he can ever receive.
Here, without regard to any spurious criterion of party, or any other divisive influence in our own country, people gather to say to him "Happy Birthday." The affection that inspired this gathering, I venture to say, is the most valuable commodity--unseen as it is, it is bound to be felt by him today, and in the future.
It means that in the estimation of all of these people, that he, as the first citizen of your State, does a worthy job in your service.
I merely want, therefore, as my part in this celebration, to help him thank you for coming here, because I know that his own heart will be so full of gratitude and humility that he can't say it as eloquently as he should like.
So I help him to say to each of you: thank you so much for coming here to tell him Happy Birthday.
Goodbye and good luck.
Note: The President spoke in Bushnell Park at 12:40 p.m.
