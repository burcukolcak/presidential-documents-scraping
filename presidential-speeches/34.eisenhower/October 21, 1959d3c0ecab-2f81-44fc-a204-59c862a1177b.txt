Statement by the President on the Proposed Transfer of the Army Ballistic Missiles Agency to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
TO STRENGTHEN the national space effort and provide for America's changing requirements in this field, I have concluded that the Army Ballistic Missiles Agency can best serve the national interest as an integral part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Army Ballistic Missiles Agency team has demonstrated its intense dedication in this field and has shown its high technical proficiency through splendid accomplishments under Army aegis.
The contemplated transfer provides new opportunity for them to contribute their special capabilities directly to the expanding civilian space program.
As part of this action, the development of "super-booster" space vehicles will be consolidated in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, under the immediate direction of this team. I have directed that this program be vigorously pressed forward.
The specific plan and details involved in this transfer, including provision for continuation of military missile programs now assigned to the Army Ballistic Missiles Agency, will be ready to lay before the Congress when it reconvenes.
