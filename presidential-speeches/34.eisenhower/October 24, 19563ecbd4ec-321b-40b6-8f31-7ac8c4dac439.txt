Letter to James A. Sheehan, Associate Editor, National Tribune, on the Government's Veterans Program.
[Released October 24, 1956. Dated October 22, 1956]
Dear Mr. Sheehan:
The veterans program of our Federal Government is the finest in the world and it has been largely developed on a bipartisan basis. In war and in peace the Nation is united in gratitude and responsibility to its veterans.
Our veterans and their dependents are receiving efficient service today. Rates of compensation and pension have been increased; nearly 400,000 more veterans and dependents are on the rolls. The best medical care is being provided in Veterans' Administration hospitals for an ever-increasing patient load. Millions of veterans have been helped through G. I. insurance, education and loans, and many other benefit programs.
I do concur wholeheartedly with the Bradley Commission's declaration that the service-connected needs of veterans should be given the highest priority, and that service-connected compensation and death benefits should be liberal and generous. I also believe our totally disabled veterans are under-compensated, and I intend to urge action to remedy this in the next session of Congress.
Sharing in the defense of our Nation is one of the duties of citizenship. At the same time, the men and women who have sacrificed in this defense must be able to count on their Government's appreciation and help.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The Bradley Commission was established by Executive Order 10588 of January 14, 1955 (3 CFR, 1955 Supp.), as the President's Commission on Veterans' Pensions. General Omar N. Bradley was chairman of the Commission.
