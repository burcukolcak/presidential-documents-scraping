I greatly appreciate your report on the success of the Veterans Administration program to eliminate segregation in all VA hospitals and domiciliaries. You and all who cooperated with you in this program are to be highly commended.
In making the success of your program possible, our people have once again demonstrated their social maturity and their determination to have in America fair play and equal opportunity. In your accomplishment, Americans everywhere can take a great and justifiable pride.
With warm regard,
Sincerely,
