Statement by the President Concerning the Entry Into the United States of Adopted Foreign-Born Orphans.
I HAVE BEEN particularly concerned over the hardship that ensues to American citizens who have adopted foreign-born orphans and who have then found that they cannot bring their adopted children into the United States because quotas under the Walter-McCarran Act and the Refugee Relief Act are exhausted. Many of these foster parents are members of our armed forces who have completed tours of duty overseas and are forced to leave their adopted children behind.
I requested the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to determine whether it is possible to alleviate this problem-within the framework of existing law. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General have just reported to me that this can be done. Provision for bringing these orphans to our country, pending action by Congress to amend the law, will be put into effect immediately.
