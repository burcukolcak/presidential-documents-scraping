October 26, 1956

Proclamation 3162â€”Veteran's Day, 1956

Whereasour people have long honored those who served and fought in the armed forces of this Nation for the high principles which all Americans hold dear; and
Whereas, although this tradition of esteem is a continuing, living part of our thoughts and lives, it is appropriate that we should set aside one special day each year to express our gratitude and indebtedness to those who sacrificed so much, and to rededicate ourselves not only to the preservation of our heritage of freedom but also to the task of achieving an enduring peace with honor among all nations of the world; and
Whereasthe Congress by an act approved June 1, 1954 (68 Stat. 168), expanded the significance of the observance of November 11, the anniversary of the ending of hostilities in World War I, which theretofore had been declared a legal holiday and observed as Armistice Day, by designating that date as Veterans Day in order to honor the veterans of all our wars:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon all our citizens to observe Sunday, November 11, 1956, as Veterans Day with appropriate ceremonies; and I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on that day.
And on Veterans Day let us recall with solemn gratitude the courage and the sacrifices of our veterans, and let us re-consecrate ourselves to the preservation of our cherished freedom.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 26th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
