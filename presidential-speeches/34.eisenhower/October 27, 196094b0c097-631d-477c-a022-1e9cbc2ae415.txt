Proclamation 3378â€”Imposing Import Quotas on Tung Oil and Tung Nuts

Whereas, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), the Secretary of Agriculture advised me he had reason to believe that tung oil and tung nuts are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to tong nuts; and
Whereas, on August 30, 1960, I requested the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation under the said section 22 with respect to this matter; and
Whereasthe Tariff Commission has made such investigation and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith; and
Whereas, on the basis of the investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that, in the absence of import restrictions beyond October 31, 1960, tung oil and tung nuts are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to materially interfere with the said price-support program; and
WhereasI find and declare that the imposition of the limitations on imports of tung oil and tung nuts hereinafter proclaimed is shown by such investigation of the Tariff Commission to be necessary in order that the entry of tung oil and tong nuts will not materially interfere with such price-support program; and
WhereasI find that the limitations on imports of tung oil and tung nuts hereinafter proclaimed will not reduce the permissible total quantity of tung oil and tung nuts which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, to proportionately less than 50 per centum of the average annual quantity of tung oil and tung nuts entered during the representative period November 1, 1952, to October 31, 1956, inclusive:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:
1. For each of the three twelve-month periods beginning on November 1, 1960, November 1, 1961, and November 1, 1962, the total aggregate quantity of tung oil and tung nuts (in terms of their oil equivalent) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption shall not exceed 26,000,000 pounds, of which not more than 6,500,000 pounds shall be entered or withdrawn during the first quarter of each such twelve-month period.
2. Of the 26,000,000 pounds specified in paragraph 1 not more than 22,100,000 pounds shall be the product of Argentina, nor more than 2,964,000 pounds shall be the product of Paraguay, nor more than 936,000 pounds shall be the product of other foreign countries; and of the 8,500,000 pounds specified in paragraph 1 not more than 5,525,000 pounds shall be the product of Argentina, nor more than 741,000 pounds shall be the Product of Paraguay, nor more than 234,000 pounds shall be the product of other foreign countries.
For the purposes of this proclamation the oil equivalent of tung nuts shall be computed on the basis of 15.9 pounds of oil for each 100 pounds of whole nuts, and on the basis of 35.8 pounds of oil for each 100 pounds of decorticated nuts.
In order to assure equitable treatment to supplying countries, all tong oil and tuns nuts entered or withdrawn pursuant to this proclamation shall have been a direct shipment destined to the United States on an original through bill of lading from the country of production.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-seventh day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth.
