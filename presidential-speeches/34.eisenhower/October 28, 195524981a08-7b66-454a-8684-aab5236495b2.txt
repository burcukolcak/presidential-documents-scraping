Letter to President Ruiz Cortines of Mexico on the Hurricane-Flood Disaster in Tampico.
[Released October 28, 1955. Dated October 24, 1955]
Dear Mr. President:
From my room here I have followed closely and with great anxiety the tragedy in Tampico. I am thankful that the crisis has passed and that the task of reconstruction can go forward.
I am deeply grateful, Mr. President, that you gave us the opportunity to share those dark days with you. It afforded our two peoples another opportunity to demonstrate to each other and to the world the brotherly bonds that exist between your great country and my own.
Ambassador White has informed me of your government's generous offer to reimburse the United States for expenses incident to the relief operations. It was the intention that this should be a contribution from the government and the people of the United States and an indication of our solidarity and desire to alleviate in part the distress of the Mexican people during this time of suffering. I hope that you will, therefore, be able to accept it in that spirit.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
