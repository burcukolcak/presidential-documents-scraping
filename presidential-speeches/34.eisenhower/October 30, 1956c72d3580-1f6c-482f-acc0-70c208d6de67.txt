Telegram to Members of Republican Organizations Regretting Need for Canceling an Airport Meeting.
I SEND YOU this message with exceeding regret. I was looking forward with anticipation and pleasure to revisiting Texas not only to thank the people of the State once again for honoring me with their support four years ago, but also to discuss with them both our accomplishments these last four years and our programs for the future.
The turn of events yesterday leaves me no option--in the interest of working for peace--but to remain at the White House Wednesday to deal with the situation developing in the Middle East.
I know that you--your associates who have worked with you in making arrangements for my visit--and our friends in Texas will fully understand the need for this change. To all concerned-and especially to the citizens of Texas--please extend my deepest regrets that my visit to your State is not now possible.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: This and similar telegrams were sent to several members of the Citizens for Eisenhower and Democrats for Eisenhower organizations in Texas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. The meetings had been scheduled for October 31.
