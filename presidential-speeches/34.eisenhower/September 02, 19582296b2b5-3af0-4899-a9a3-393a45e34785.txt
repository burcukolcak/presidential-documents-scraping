Memorandum of Disapproval of Bill for the Relief of the Southwest Research Institute.
I AM WITHHOLDING my approval from H. R. 1494, "For the relief of the Southwest Research Institute."

This bill would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to the Southwest Research Institute such sum, not exceeding $8,200.84, as the Housing and Home finance Administrator may approve. This payment would be for services rendered by the beneficiary in excess of its written contract with the Government.
Approval of this legislation could well encourage others to perform unauthorized work and expect payment therefor from the Government. furthermore, under this bill this organization would receive preferential treatment which has in the past been denied other research contractors who performed work in excess of their contract obligations.
