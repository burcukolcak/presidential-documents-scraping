Executive Order 10781â€”Suspension of Certain Provisions of Section 5764(a), Title 10, United States Code, Which Relate to Establishment of Zones for Promotion of Male Officers of the Navy
By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 5785 (b) of title 10 of the United States Code, it is ordered as follows:
Except as to the provisions which read,
The Secretary of the Navy shall establish a promotion zone in each grade for male officers in the line of the Navy not restricted in the performance of duty when he convenes a selection board under chapter 543 of this title to consider officers in that grade for recommendation for promotion to the next higher grade. The promotion zone in each grade shall be composed of that number of the most senior such officers under consideration, who are eligible for selection for promotion to the next higher grade and who have not previously failed of such selection, that must either be selected for promotion by the particular board or be considered as having failed of such selection, in order to maintain a flow of promotion consistent with the terms of service set out in section 5768 of this title and in order best to assure to individuals in succeeding years equality of opportunity for promotion, the provisions of section 5764 (a) of title 10 of the United States Code are hereby suspended until June 30 of the fiscal year following that in which the national emergency proclaimed by Proclamation No. 2914 of December 16, 1950, shall end.
