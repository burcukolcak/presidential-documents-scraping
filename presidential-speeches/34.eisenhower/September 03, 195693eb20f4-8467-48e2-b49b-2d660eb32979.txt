Statement by the President on Making Public a Report by Secretary of Labor James P. Mitchell.
THIS REPORT, outlining the present status of the welfare of the working men and women as of Labor Day, 1956, is personally gratifying to me, as it will be to all our citizens.
The constant improvement of the economic strength and welfare of American workers has been one of the main objectives of the Administration. As this strength improves so does the strength of the entire nation.
The progress of the working men and women in America toward ever better conditions serves also as an example to the rest of the world of the benefits that can be accomplished by free labor under a free government.
Note: Secretary Mitchell's report is in the form of a letter, dated September 3, 1956, summarizing the benefits gained by American workers during the President's first term. In closing, the Secretary noted that the level of the economy had never been higher in peace or war and that the take-home pay of the factory worker had increased by more than eight dollars and a half a week.
