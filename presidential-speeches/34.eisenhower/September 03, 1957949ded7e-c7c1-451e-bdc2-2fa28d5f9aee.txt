Statement by the President Upon Signing the Mutual Security Appropriation Bill.
I HAVE APPROVED H. R. 9302, making appropriation for Mutual Security for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1958. This bill provides a sum that is substantially less than the amount I originally requested for this program.
I will keep a close and continuous watch to see the effects which this serious cut has upon the program during the course of the year. The Administration will, of course, endeavor to administer the program as effectively as possible with the funds which have been made available.
Note: As enacted, H. R. 9302 is Public Law 85-279 (71 Stat. 601).
