Message to the Fifth Annual Assembly of the Atlantic Treaty Association in Tours.
PLEASE convey my greetings to those participating in the Fifth Annual Assembly of the Atlantic Treaty Association. This annual meeting of distinguished citizens of the NATO countries reflects the democratic spirit of voluntary friendship and accommodation of national interests on which the strength of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization rests. The enlightened support of the people of these countries is vital to the organization in sustaining unity of purpose to maintain the common security. In the Atlantic Treaty Association and its constituent national groups they have an indispensable channel for demonstrating to all their intent to work together in the protection of their freedom.
As the Association meets again to confer on matters affecting NATO, it has my warm encouragement in its efforts to secure a fuller support and understanding of NATO as a partnership of free and peaceful nations.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
