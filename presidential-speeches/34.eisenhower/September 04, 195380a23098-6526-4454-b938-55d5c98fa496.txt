Memorandum on the Community Chest and United Fund Campaigns.
To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
Under date of June 22, 1953 I addressed a communication to you regarding cooperation of the Federal government in the fall campaigns of Community Chests and United Funds to be held all over the country.
In order that we may reinforce our assurance of cooperation I have approved the appointment of George M. Humphrey, Secretary of the Treasury, as Vice-Chairman for the Federal government of United Community Campaigns. Through Mr. Humphrey you will receive further word of detailed arrangements so that all employes of the Federal government in communities throughout the United States and its territories and possessions may have the opportunity to subscribe and to pay their subscriptions over an extended period.
I am confident that you will be glad to join with Mr. Humphrey in this program which involves support of voluntary health and welfare services in more than 1700 local communities and which also includes support of the United Defense Fund. The service of the USO to the armed forces, help to communities overwhelmed by defense activities and relief to Korea are all provided, as you know, through the United Defense Fund.
