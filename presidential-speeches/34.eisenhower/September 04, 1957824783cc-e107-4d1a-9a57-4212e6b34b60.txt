Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill for the Relief of Jackson School Township, Indiana.
I HAVE APPROVED S. 807, for the relief of Jackson School Township, Indiana. I have done so only because in the bill itself Congress has made a finding that the school property has been rendered useless for school purposes due to the noise and danger from aircraft using Bunker Hill Air Base.
Such questions of fact should more appropriately be determined by the Courts, and hereafter I shall insist that these disputed fact questions be determined by our Courts in the usual way.
Note: As enacted, S. 807 is Public Law 85-291 (71 Stat. 615).
