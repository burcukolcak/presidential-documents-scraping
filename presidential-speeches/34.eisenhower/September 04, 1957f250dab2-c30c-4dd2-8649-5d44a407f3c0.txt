Dwight D. Eisenhower
September 04, 1957

Remarks Upon Arrival at Old Colony House, Newport, Rhode Island.
Mayor Sullivan, Senator Green, Reverend Clergy, and My Good Friends, because that is the way I feel already in this lovely city:
My first duty is to attempt to express to you Mrs. Eisenhower's deep distress that she could not come with me to greet you this morning to express her appreciation in person for the great courtesy of the welcome we have received. I am happy to report to you that she continues to improve, stood the trip well, and I hope in a couple of days may be able to visit some of the historical spots of this region which is so rich in incidents of American history. It is her great ambition to visit so many of these places, particularly those where the heroes of the Revolutionary times spent so much of their time.
For myself, I assure you no vacation has ever started more auspiciously. Never did I feel so good on the first two hours of getting away from Washington, and I assure you it is not just because I am getting away from Washington. From the moment we landed at the air station, we have encountered only warmth of cordiality, an evident spirit of hospitality and of friendliness that has touched us deeply. And a mere "Thank You" seems inadequate, but that is all that I can say.
I assure you, we look forward to the time of our lives in this region and I hope that we may be able to stay until the normal space of a vacation has ended, which for me would be probably extended a great deal more than some others think I should. But to each of you, Thanks. Maybe I will run into you again from time to time.
I am delighted--pleased--by the great welcome you have given to me and my wife on this September day. Thank you again.
Note: The President's opening words "Mayor Sullivan" and "Senator Green" referred to John J. Sullivan, Mayor of Newport, and Theodore Francis Green, U. S. Senator from Rhode Island.
