Letter to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs Concerning His Meetings With the Major Tribal Groups.
[Released September 5, 1953. Dated September 2, 1953 ]
- Dear Commissioner Emmons:
This Administration, as you know, has pledged itself to consult with the Indian people of this country and to give them every opportunity for a full expression of their desires, suggestions, hopes and aspirations. In order to fulfill this pledge, I am asking you, as my personal representative, to go into the home territory of the Indians during the next several months and meet with each of the major tribal groups of the country.
Please emphasize to the Indian people our sincere desire for the benefit of their views. While we cannot anticipate that there will always be perfect agreement between the Indians and their Government as a result of these conferences, it is essential for us to learn firsthand their thoughts, needs, and aspirations. Only with such knowledge can we move forward with a warm and realistic understanding in shaping policies and programs for the future administration of Indian affairs.
I realize that the task I am assigning you will be arduous and that it will make heavy demands on your time and energies during the next few months. I am confident, however, that our Indian citizens will appreciate the effort you are making and the spirit directing it.
Please express to each of the Indian groups you meet my warm personal greetings and my heartfelt personal assurance that our ruling aim in Indian affairs is to meet and to deal with them justly and progressively on all matters at all times.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
