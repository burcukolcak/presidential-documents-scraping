Letter to Field Marshal The Viscount Montgomery of Alamein on the Occasion of His Retirement.
[ Released September 17, 1958. Dated September 15, 1598 ]
Dear Monty:
After a long, honorable career you are relinquishing your post as Deputy Supreme Allied Commander in Europe.
This occasion evokes many treasured memories of our close personal and professional association both in peace and in war. It brings to mind your distinguished wartime record and your great contribution to the undertaking in which fifteen nations are now joined in a common effort toward peace and justice in the world. Even before the North Atlantic Treaty came into being, you devoted your energy, experience, and skill to the common defense. Through the years it has been a source of comfort and confidence to us all and to me personally to know that you were part of this endeavor.

You take with you in retirement the heartfelt thanks and the very best wishes of your many friends and associates. With these I warmly include my own.

As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
