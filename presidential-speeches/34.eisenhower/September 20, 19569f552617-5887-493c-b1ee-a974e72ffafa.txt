Each such agreement (a) shall provide that the Secretary of the Army with respect to such employees of the Army National Guard, and the Secretary of the Air Force with respect to such employees of the Air National Guard, shall comply with the requirements of such State or Territorial law in the case of employees subject to the said act of June 15, 1956, who are eligible for membership in such retirement system for State or Territorial employees, (b) shall specify when the withholding of sums from the compensation of such State or Territorial employees shall commence, and
(c) shall provide for procedures for the withholding, the filing of the returns. and the payment of the sums withheld from compensation to the State or Territory which conform, so far as practicable, to the usual fiscal practices of the Department of the Army and the Department of the Air Force, respectively.

The Secretary of the Army with respect to Army National Guard employees, and the Secretary of the Air Force with respect to Air National Guard employees, shall designate, or provide for the designation of, the officers or employees whose duty it shall be to withhold sums from compensation, file required returns, and direct the payment of such sums withheld, in accordance with the terms of the agreements entered into between the Secretary of Defense and the States or Territories.
4. Nothing in this order, or in rules or regulations issued thereunder, or in any agreement entered into pursuant thereto, shall be construed as giving consent to the application of any provision of law of any State or Territory which has the effect of imposing more burdensome requirements upon the United States than it imposes upon the departments, agencies, or political subdivisions of the State or Territory concerned with respect to employees thereof who are members of the State or Territorial retirement system, or which has the effect of subjecting the United States or any of its officers or employees to any penalty or liability.
5. As used in this order, the term "employees" means civilian employees of the Army National Guard or Air National Guard of a State or Territory who are employed pursuant to section 709 of title 32 of the United States Code, and paid from Federal, appropriated funds.
6. I hereby delegate to the Secretary of Defense authority to prescribe such rules and regulations not inconsistent herewith as may be necessary to further effectuate the provisions of the said act of June 15, 1956, or of this order.
