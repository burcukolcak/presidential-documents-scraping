Dwight D. Eisenhower
September 21, 1954

Statement by the President: National Day of Prayer.
IN COMMON WITH religious people everywhere, we in America know that the true cure for the tensions that threaten and too often produce war lies not in guns and bombs but in the spirits and minds of men. We are firm in the belief that faith is the mightiest force that man has at his command. On September twenty-second, we are therefore observing, with an act of faith, a national day of prayer. Throughout the United States of America, whatever our ancestry, whatever our religious affiliation, we shall offer simultaneously to the Almighty our personal prayers for the devotion, wisdom and stamina to work unceasingly for a just and lasting peace for all mankind.
I most earnestly hope that men and women, boys and girls over all the world will join us on that day in that act of faith. May the many millions of people shut away from contact and communion with peoples of the free world join their prayers with ours. May the world be ringed with an act of faith so strong as to. annihilate the cruel, artificial barriers erected by little men between the peoples who seek peace on earth through the Divine Spirit.
