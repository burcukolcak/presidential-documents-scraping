Memorandum of Disapproval of Bill Amending the Federal Boating Act of 1958.
I AM withholding my approval from H.R. 8728, "To amend the Federal Boating Act of 1958 to extend until April 1, 1961, the period when certain provisions of that Act will take effect."
The Federal Boating Act of 1958 provides for the establishment of a new system of numbering small undocumented vessels. Under the Act, the part of the new system to be administered by the United States Coast Guard is to go into effect on April 1, 1960, at which time the authority for the existing system would be repealed. The bill would extend this effective date from April 1, 1960, to April 1, 1961.
This legislation was originally considered necessary because it had not been possible to obtain a supplemental appropriation for the Coast Guard to administer the new system. Since Congress passed the bill, however, the funds required for the implementation of the Federal Boating Act have been included in the Mutual Security Appropriation Act, 1960. Consequently, the extension of time provided in the bill is no longer needed.
