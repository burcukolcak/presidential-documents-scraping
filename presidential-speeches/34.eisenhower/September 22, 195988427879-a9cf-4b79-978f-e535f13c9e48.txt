Letter to Secretary Anderson Approving the Increase in Interest Rates for Savings Bonds.
Dear Mr. Secretary:
In accordance with legislation signed into law earlier today, I am returning with my approval your proposal to increase the interest return on all United States Series E and H Savings Bonds.
In approving your recommendation, I take this opportunity to reaffirm my enthusiastic support of the Savings Bonds Program. This is one of our country's finest and most worthwhile activities. It contributes to the sound management of the Nation's finances. It gives millions of American families the opportunity to save safely and regularly--while investing in their Nation's future.
To my mind there is no better way of saving, no more effective way of strengthening our power for peace, than to own United States Savings Bonds. To buy these bonds is to express faith in America. It helps provide the economic strength in both our Government and in individual families on which our freedom depends. I hope that the making of both old and new Savings Bonds even more attractive will serve as a renewed invitation to every citizen to buy and hold these "Shares in America."

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
