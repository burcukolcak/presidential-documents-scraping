Joint Statement following Meeting With Prime Minister Macmillan To Discuss the Situation Before the United Nations.
THE PRESIDENT of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great Britain had a breakfast meeting this morning starting at 8:00 o'clock in the President's suite in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. They were joined at 9:00 A.M. by the Secretary of State and British foreign Secretary Lord Home.
The President and the Prime Minister reviewed the situation in the General Assembly of the United Nations and considered the policies best pursued by their two countries towards their common goal. They were in complete agreement as to the vital role of the United Nations, particularly in the Congo crisis and the need to give full support to the Secretary General in his task. They greatly hope that after a stormy start the General Assembly will now be able to concentrate on serious, sober and constructive work, notably in the matter of disarmament.
