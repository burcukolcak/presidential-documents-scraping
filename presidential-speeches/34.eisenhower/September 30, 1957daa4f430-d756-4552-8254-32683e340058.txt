Remarks on Leaving Newport, Rhode Island.
WELL, the time has come for Mrs. Eisenhower and me to say goodbye to the good people of Newport and Rhode Island. We are grateful to all of them and to the Navy personnel who have been our hosts while here for the cordiality and the hospitality that we have encountered on all sides. We were deeply touched by the warmth of your welcome, and the memory of that welcome will live with us all our lives.
In these lovely surroundings and encountering so many wonderful people, always ready to show a kindly face to us, we have had one of the finest vacations that has ever been our privilege to

enjoy.
Our one regret is we did not get to examine carefully so many of the historic sights in which this region abounds, but we hope that we may come back another year and have a little more time to devote to that sort of thing.
So, in the meantime, goodbye and thank each of you for the very fine vacation we have had in this lovely area.
Goodbye.
Note: The President spoke at the dock, on board the "Barbara Anne," at the U. S. Naval Base, Coaster's Harbor Island, Newport, R. I.
