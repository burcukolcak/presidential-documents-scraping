Message to the Conference of Chiefs of State of African Nations Meeting in Yaounde.
[ Released April 6, 1961 Dated March 25, 1961 ]
IT GIVES ME deep pleasure to send the greetings of the Government and people of the United States to you who are gathered at Yaounde to consult on matters of high importance in your mutual interest.
It is a particular pleasure because your consultations represent the kind of regional cooperation that strengthens hope in a world too often divided and torn by dispute. Yours is an association of free and sovereign nations, dedicated to constructive action for the welfare of your peoples. It is this partnership in freedom that is most impressive to my country and it deserves the emulation of us all. I congratulate you and pledge the readiness of my country to provide concrete support, if you so desire, for your efforts to make effective a permanent organization to foster your economic cooperation and development. You have our warmest good wishes for every success.
Note: The chiefs of state of 12 African nations participated in the conference, during which the African and Malagasy Organization for Economic Cooperation was formed.
