John F. Kennedy
April 08, 1961

Statement by the President on the Extension of the Reorganization Act.
THE REORGANIZATION ACT restores a long accepted and useful procedure for transmitting to the Congress plans for accomplishing Executive reorganizations. It places responsibility for initiating needed action upon the Executive without affecting the right of Congress to scrutinize and legislate in this area. It should result in promoting improvements in government organization and it should make possible more economical operation.
Note: On April 7, 1961, the President approved an amendment to the Reorganization Act of 1949 extending it to June 1, 1963 (Public Law 87-18, 75 Stat. 41).
