Statement by the President on the Emergency Feed Grain Program.
WITHIN A FEW DAYS farmers will have an opportunity to sign up and cooperate in the 1960 emergency feed grain program. I urge all feed grain producers to give careful and serious consideration to the opportunities offered them by this program.
The response to these opportunities by the farmers will undoubtedly have considerable influence upon future agricultural legislation. Members of Congress from both rural and urban sections of the country supported this program, for it provides an opportunity to improve farm income while reducing the cost of the farm program to the Federal Government; to curtail the surplus stocks of basic commodities while insuring an abundant supply of meat, eggs, and dairy products; and to provide fair and stable prices to consumers.
The program is voluntary. Each farmer must choose for himself. But by joint action we can bring order to a chaotic segment of our economy.
I believe this will constitute a major step forward toward a sound and rational program for all agriculture.
