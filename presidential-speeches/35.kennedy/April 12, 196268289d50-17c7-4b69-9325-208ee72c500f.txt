Statement by the President on Equal Opportunity in Housing.
THE HEARINGS being held today by the Commission on Civil Rights on the status of equal opportunity in housing are of the utmost importance, to our Nation as well as to our city.
Thirteen years ago, in passing the National Housing Act, Congress pledged itself to the goal of a decent home in a suitable living environment for all Americans. It is clear now, as it was then, that this objective cannot be fulfilled as long as some Americans are denied equal access to the housing market because of their race or religion.
In our Nation's Capital the problem is more than assuring equal opportunity to American citizens. When racial discrimination persists here, it sometimes constitutes a personal affront to the diplomats of sovereign nations and always reflects upon our ability as a nation to live up to our Constitutional ideals.
Washington should provide an example of our worthiest professions and best practices, both for the nation and the world. We have made progress toward this goal, but we are not yet there.
Thus, I welcome this inquiry into the status of equal housing opportunity in Washington. As a bipartisan agency composed of distinguished educators from all sections of the United States, the Commission on Civil Rights is uniquely suited to search out the facts, sift the evidence and recommend corrective action. I am following these proceedings with interest and I look forward to the Commission's report and recommendations.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
