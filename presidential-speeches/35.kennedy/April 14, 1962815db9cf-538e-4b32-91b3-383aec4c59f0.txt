John F. Kennedy
April 14, 1962

Remarks at the Marine Air Station, Cherry Point, North Carolina.
Mr. Vice President, Mr. Secretary, Admiral Dennison, General, our friends the Ambassadors and Members of the Congress:
I know I speak on behalf of the entire group that were the guests of the Navy and the Marines today in expressing our great appreciation to all of the officers and men who took part in today's operation. And I don't think that there are any of us who do not leave this base this afternoon prouder than ever that we are citizens of the United States and strong supporters of the efforts of the men who are serving this country so well.
The fact is that the ships and men and marines on the ground and in the air, on this base and nearby, are helping to defend the freedom of countries which are thousands of miles away. We are most appreciative to them for their efforts, and it is, I know, day in and day out doing routine jobs which keep this country free and at peace.
We also want to express our appreciation to their families who are here today. We are obligated to all of you. And I know that you share a sense of satisfaction that in this critical time in the life of our country you and your husbands are meeting, and more than meeting, your responsibilities.
We express our thanks to all of you, and we will continue to count upon you to join with all other Americans in meeting and fulfilling their duties. We thank you.
Note: The President spoke at a combat readiness and weapons demonstration. In his opening words he referred to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, Adm. Robert L. Dennison, Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic, and Commander of the Atlantic fleet, and Gen. David M. Shoup, Commandant of the Marine Corps.
