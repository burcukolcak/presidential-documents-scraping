Memorandum on Racial or Other Discrimination in Federal Employee Recreational Associations
[Released April 20, 1961. Dated April 18, 1961]
Memorandum for the Heads of all Executive Departments and Agencies:
Executive Order Number 10925, promulgated March 6, 1961, reaffirms that "discrimination because of race, creed, color or national origin is contrary to the Constitutional principles and policies of the United States" and that "it is the policy of the Executive Branch of the Government to encourage by positive measures equal opportunity for all qualified persons within the Government."
I want immediate and specific action taken to assure that no use is made of the name, sponsorship, facilities, or activity of any Executive Department or Agency by or for any employee recreational organization practicing discrimination based on race, creed, color, or national origin. Current practices in each Department are to be brought into immediate compliance with this policy, and a report by the head of each Executive Agency filed to that effect before May 1, 1961.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
