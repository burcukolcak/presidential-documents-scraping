Statement by the President on the Occasion of the First Anniversary of the Revolution in Korea.
TODAY the Korean Government and people are celebrating the first anniversary of the April 19 Revolution in the Republic of Korea. I should like to salute the Korean Government and people on this important occasion and express the respect and admiration which the American people have in their hearts for the Korean people who have so courageously demonstrated their devotion to the cause of political democracy and social progress.
On this significant anniversary I should like to affirm to the Korean people once again that the United States shares their hopes and ideals and that my Government intends to continue to assist the Korean Government in every possible and appropriate way in its efforts to lead the Korean people toward the better life they so greatly desire and deserve.
