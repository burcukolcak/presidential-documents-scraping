Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House Recommending an Additional Assistant Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare
[Released April 18, 1961. Dated April 17, 1961]
Dear Mr.____________:
The vast increase in the international responsibilities of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in recent years has made this a major activity of that Department. It is important and requires continuing attention at a high level. I, therefore, recommend that there he established in the Department a position of Assistant Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and that this Assistant Secretary have primary responsibility for advising and assisting the Secretary in the field of international affairs. Transmitted herewith is a draft of a bill which would carry out this purpose.
It may be necessary, from time to time, to assign additional functions to this Assistant Secretary. He should not be precluded from assuming such additional functions.
I am convinced that the United States must make full use of its professional and technical skills and resources to assist other nations, particularly those newly emerging. The new Assistant Secretary would provide the necessary assistance to the Secretary to meet this need.

Enclosed is a letter from the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare describing the proposal in more detail.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
