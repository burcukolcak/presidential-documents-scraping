Message to Admiral Richmond on the Occasion of the 171st Anniversary of the U.S. Coast Guard.
IT GIVES ME great pleasure to extend my warmest congratulations to the United States Coast Guard on the occasion of its 171st birthday.
Throughout its long history the Coast Guard has served our Nation in peace and war with valor and distinction. Both as a military force and as our chief agency for promoting maritime safety it is making a vital contribution to our economic wellbeing and our national security.

As one who is personally familiar with the work of your fine service, I should like to express my admiration for an outstanding record of performance that has not been surpassed in the annals of our country. May you have many additional years of service to our country and to humanity.
JOHN F. KENNEDY

[Admiral Alfred C. Richmond, Commandant, United States Coast Guard, 1300 E Street NW., Washington 25, D.C.]
