Remarks on Presenting a Trophy to the Winner of the 1960 President's Cup Regatta.
I WANT to express my great pleasure at having an opportunity to present to the winner of last year's race, Mr. "Chuck" Thompson, who directed his boat Miss Detroit to win the President's Cup during the race here last summer, this trophy.
Mr. Thompson informed me that his average speed was around 98 miles per hour and that he had had this boat up to as high as 185 miles per hour.
I have been interested all my life in boats, and it's therefore a great personal pleasure to award this Cup to Mr. Thompson.
I think what is most impressive is the effort and courage of all those who run their boats at high speed. John Paul Jones once said, "Give me a fast boat and I'll go in harm's way." And you have a fast boat and we're very proud of you as Americans, and it's a great pleasure for me as President to present to you this Cup--and also to greet the other members of the committee who've been responsible for carrying on the tradition of this great race.
Note: The President presented the award to Charles ("Chuck") Thompson, Sr., at a ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House.
