Message to Sir Winston Churchill on the 20th Anniversary of the Atlantic Charter.
TODAY marks the 20th Anniversary of the Atlantic Charter. Time has not changed and events have not dimmed the historic principles you there expressed with President Franklin Roosevelt. Our two nations are still united on the common goals you two so eloquently charted at sea. We still believe that all nations must come to the abandonment of the use of force. We still seek a peace in which all the men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want. And we are still determined to protect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live--and to oppose all territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the people concerned.
Your own name will endure as long as free men survive to recall these words.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
