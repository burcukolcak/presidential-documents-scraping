Letter to Secretary Goldberg Concerning the 25th Anniversary of the First Unemployment Insurance Payment.
Dear Mr. Secretary:
I want to thank you for your letter concerning the 25th Anniversary of the first unemployment insurance payment. The occasion marks a milestone in the progress of social legislation.
The $28 billion that has been paid out in benefits since the unemployment insurance program was begun in 1936, has eased the financial burden of many millions of workers who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. It has also contributed materially to lessening the impact of economic downturns on business by providing essential purchasing power for our economy. Thus unemployment insurance has not only helped workers and their families, it has also lightened and shortened the recessions we have experienced during the past 25 years.
The contribution that the unemployment insurance program has made to the nation over the years points up the desirability of the improvements in the program I have recommended to the Congress. I hope these will be enacted early in the next session.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
