Statement by the President Urging Bipartisan Support for Long-Term Foreign Aid.
[Released August 17, 1961. Dated August 16, 1961]
LONG-TERM authorization of development loans, as earlier recommended by President Eisenhower, is essential to making certain that our foreign aid program is both efficient and effective. At a time when Secretary Dillon is about to sign our long-range pledge to Latin America, when Asia and Africa are poised between economic development and chaos, when Mr. Khrushchev is probing the West for any sign that our resolve is weakening, I cannot believe that the bipartisan support always given this program is at this crucial moment to be abandoned. I strongly urge the members of the House, by reversing this afternoon's vote, to demonstrate that this nation is still united in its determination to meet its responsibilities and halt the spread of Communism and Castroism by every available means. For eight years the Democrats in both Houses gave President Eisenhower overwhelming support in every major vote on foreign policy and foreign aid. It is urgent that this bipartisan principle be maintained in this crucial hour of the nation's history.
