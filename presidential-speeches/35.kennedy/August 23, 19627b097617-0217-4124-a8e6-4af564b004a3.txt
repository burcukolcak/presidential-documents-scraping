Statement by the President Upon Signing Order Removing Restriction on Entry Into Guam and the Pacific Islands Trust Territory
IN FURTHERANCE of our national policy of promoting self-government and encouraging expanded social and economic development in the Territories under United States administration, I have signed an Executive Order1rescinding a 1941 Executive Order (8683) which established the Guam Naval and Airspace Reservations. As a result of this action, Navy security clearances no longer will be required as a condition of entering the Territory of Guam thus providing the same freedom of movement that exists in other parts of the United States.
1Executive Order 11045, dated August 21, 1962 (27 F.R. 8511).
Further, I have directed that regulations relating to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands be revised to facilitate free entry of United States citizens, United States investment and United States flag vessels into that area. Revised procedures will be developed by the Secretaries of State, Defense and Interior.
Entry into Eniwetok, Bikini and Kwajalein Atolls, together with such other islands as may be designated for national defense purposes from time to time, will continue to be under control of the Department of Defense. All appropriate measures will be taken to insure that the security interests of the United States in the Pacific are amply safeguarded.
I intend that these actions I have taken will foster responsible political development, stimulate new economic activity, and enable the people of the Islands to participate fully in the world of today.
