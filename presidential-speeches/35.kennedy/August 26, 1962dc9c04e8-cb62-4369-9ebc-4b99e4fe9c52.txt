Letter to Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt on Receiving Report by the Commission on the Status of Women.
[Released August 26, 1962. Dated August 25, 1962]
Dear Mrs. Roosevelt:
I was very pleased to receive your report on the work of my Commission on the Status of Women, which you head, and I commend you and the other members of the Commission for the work done so far.
You can be especially pleased with the advances you have brought about by opening increased opportunities for women in the federal service and in the higher ranks of our Armed forces. These are but two examples of the areas you are attacking where this type of discrimination has prevented the full use of talents and skills.
It will be forty-two years tomorrow since women gained the right to participate fully in the governing of our country through the right to vote. It is appropriate on this date, therefore, that we take note of the progress made and the distance to be traveled to achieve full equality for all of our citizens.
Please accept my thanks for the important part you are playing in this difficult task. I know that the Commission will continue to make a beneficial contribution to our society.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY

[Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, Chairman, President's Commission on the Status of Women, Washington 25, D.C.]
