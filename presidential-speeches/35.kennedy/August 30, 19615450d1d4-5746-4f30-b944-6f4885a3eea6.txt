Statement by the President Upon Signing Resolution Deferring Drainage Payments on the Columbia Basin Project.
I AM PLEASED to sign Senate Joint Resolution 76 which will provide deferment of 1962 drainage payments for users of water in the Columbia Basin Project.
This legislation is fully in accord with the Administration's objectives and I know that the Secretary of the Interior will, with proper consultation with all interested parties, attempt to obtain a permanent solution of these repayment problems. Our goal is a rate schedule which is fair to those water users who make their living from the land and which will permit the Columbia Basin Project to go forward on a sound financial basis.
Note: As enacted, Senate Joint Resolution 76 is Public Law 87-169 (75 Stat. 408).
