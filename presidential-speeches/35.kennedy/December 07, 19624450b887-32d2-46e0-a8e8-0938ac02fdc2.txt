Remarks in Omaha Upon Presenting a Special Flight Safety Plaque to the Strategic Air Command.
IT IS a great pleasure to present this plaque to the Commanding Officer of SAC and, by this plaque, to indicate our great appreciation to the officers and men of the Strategic Air Force stationed here at this base and all around the world, and also their wives and members of their families who also serve.
This plaque pays particular attention to the contribution of the Strategic Air Command during the most intense days of the Cuban crisis. The record of SAC in mobilizing the forces of the United States was unprecedented in the long history of SAC. The amount of flights made during that period of time, the amount of men that were involved, was a record unparalleled by any country in the history of air power. There is no doubt that it contributed greatly to the maintenance of the peace and the security of the United States and those countries associated with us, and also contributed to a result which has, I believe, increased our security, so we are very much indebted to you all.
Living on this base, flying from this base, men have helped maintain the security and peace for 15 years. And it is my strong belief, a belief which has been strengthened by this morning's visit, that that peace and security can be maintained directly with the will and the courage of the people of the United States and the strong right arm, which is the Strategic Air Force.
We are indebted to you all in the past, now, and our security depends upon you in the future.

Thank you very much.
Note: The presentation was made at Offutt Air Force Base, Omaha, Nebr. During his remarks the President referred to Gen. Thomas S. Power, Commanding Officer of the Strategic Air Command.
