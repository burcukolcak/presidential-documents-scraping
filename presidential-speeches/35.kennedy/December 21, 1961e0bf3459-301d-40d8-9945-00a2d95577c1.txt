Remarks Upon Arrival at the Air Terminal in Hamilton, Bermuda.
Your Excellency, Prime Minister:
I want to express my great pleasure at having an opportunity to talk to you again, and to visit you on your territory which has been the scene on other occasions of most important meetings beneficial to both our countries.
We have had, since I assumed the responsibility of the Presidency, meetings in Washington and in Florida and in London, and I think it most appropriate at this particular time in the affairs of the world that the United States and Great Britain should once again meet, and that we should have a chance to exchange our views and coordinate our policies.
So I am delighted to be here, Prime Minister, and I am most grateful to the Governor General for his warm welcome.
Note: Prime Minister Macmillan responded as follows:
"Mr. President, it is a very great pleasure to welcome you here on British soil where, as you say, other meetings have taken place between Presidents and Prime Ministers engaged in the task which occupies us--the strengthening of our friendship to preserve the peace of the world.
"That is what we are for--that is what we are trying to do.
"We are particularly grateful to you, Mr. President, for coming at a time of great personal anxiety and sorrow to you. We appreciate that. You have all our good wishes, and on speaking today I know that I speak not only for all those here assembled in this lovely island of Bermuda, but for all British people all over the world, wherever they may be.
"I thank you."
The President's opening words "Your Excellency" referred to Maj. Gen. Sir Julian Gascoigne, Governor of Bermuda.
