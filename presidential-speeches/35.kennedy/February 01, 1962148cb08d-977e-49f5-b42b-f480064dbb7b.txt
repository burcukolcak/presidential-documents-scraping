Remarks of Welcome to the Members of the U.S. Delegation Upon Their Return From the Punta del Este Conference
ON BEHALF of all the people of this country, we want to express our great pleasure in extending a very warm welcome on a cold day to the Secretary of State and to the entire delegation--the Members of the Congress from the House and Senate of both parties, who together represented our country during some most important days. All of us have the greatest pride and satisfaction in their work.
I believe that the delegation was most ably led by the Secretary of State who I think under the conditions which represented intensive negotiations for a long period of time in attempting to reconcile and maintain and strengthen the Organization of American States, in which we all believe--I believe that he did himself great credit and he did his country credit. And I want to express our thanks to him and to the Members of the Congress who accompanied him, who represented us all.
We believe strongly in the American system, and my strong conviction is that as a result of this meeting and as a result of the efforts of the delegation, this system has been strengthened--and I think communism has been isolated in this hemisphere. And I think the hemisphere can move on towards progress.
So, Mr. Secretary, and Members of the Congress, we thank you and welcome you home with great appreciation.
Note: The President spoke in the Rose Garden at' the White House.
Secretary Rusk was accompanied to the conference by Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon, Senator Bourke Hickenlooper of Iowa, Representative Armistead I. Selden, Jr., of Alabama, and Representative Chester E. Merrow of New Hampshire.
