[ Released February 4, 1961. Dated February 2, 1961 ]
Dear Dr. Hallstein:
I deeply appreciate the kind expression of good wishes extended on behalf of yourself and the Commission of the European Economic Community.
It is my sincere hope that the years to come will see further steady progress toward the goals envisaged by the Treaty of Rome, an objective to which the United States will continue to lend its steadfast support.
The Government of the United States looks forward to close collaboration with the Commission of the EEC, and to the development of relationships between the European Economic Community and the United States, as well as other countries, which will redound to the benefit of the entire free world.
