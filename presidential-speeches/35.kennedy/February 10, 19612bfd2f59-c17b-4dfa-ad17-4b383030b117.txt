Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House Proposing Creation of Additional Federal Judgeships.
[ Released February 10, 1961. Dated February 9, 1961 ]
Dear Mr._______:
I have requested the Attorney General to submit to the Congress legislation to create fifty-nine additional Federal judgeships to relieve serious congestion and delays in many Federal Courts. Fifty will be in the District Courts and nine in the Court of Appeals.
Extensive Congressional hearings have been conducted in both the Senate and the House in recent Congresses and testimony received from representatives of the American Bar Association, State and local associations, the Judicial Conference of the United States and others interested in and affected by the operations of our courts, showing very clearly that the administration of justice in the Federal Court system is unduly delayed. Despite the tremendous increase of court congestion and judicial lag, no new Federal judgeships have been created since February 10, 1954.
I have asked the Attorney General separately to describe to you the essential details of this essential legislation. Prompt and favorable consideration of the measure will be of direct benefit to millions of people throughout the country.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
