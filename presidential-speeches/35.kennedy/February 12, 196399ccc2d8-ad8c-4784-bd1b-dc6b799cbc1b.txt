Statement by the President on the Resumption of the Geneva Disarmament Meetings.
WE LOOK with hope to the work which begins in Geneva as the 18-nation disarmament meetings resume. Agreement does not lie within easy reach. The difficulties in reaching such an agreement can only be resolved if all parties face them in a spirit of willingness to negotiate--if there is a genuine spirit of cooperation, coupled with a firm resolve to reverse the present dangerous trend of the arms race. The prospects of agreement on a test ban treaty now seem somewhat more encouraging than before because of the acceptance by the Soviet Union of the principle of on-site inspection, but very important questions remain to be worked out. We must seek an agreement that will serve the world's real interests by deserving, and promoting, confidence and trust among the nations.
The United States also believes that measures to reduce the risk of war by accident, miscalculation, or failure of communication should be pressed with energy. Discussions to date have indicated a mutual interest in specific risk of war measures. This suggests that now may be the time actively to pursue these matters.
It is clear then that the conference has before it new opportunities for serious negotiation.
And if agreements here could be coupled with further measures designed to contain the nuclear threat, then the more ambitious task of developing a broad-range program for general and complete disarmament would surely proceed in an atmosphere of greater international confidence, stability, and security.
