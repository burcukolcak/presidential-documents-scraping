Statement by the President on the Science Advisory Committee Report "Science, Government, and Information."
[Released February 17, 1963. Dated January 10, 1963]
ONE of the major opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of our national scientific and technical effort and the efficiency of Government management of research and development lies in the improvement of our ability to communicate information about current research efforts and the results of past efforts.
This report of the Science Advisory Committee draws attention to the importance of good communication to modern scientific and technical endeavor. It makes a welcome contribution to better understanding of the problems of scientific and technical communication both within the Government and outside of Government and of the steps that can be taken to meet these problems.
As the report points out, strong science and technology is a national necessity and adequate communication is a prerequisite for strong science and technology.
The observations of the Committee deserves serious consideration by scientists and engineers engaged in research and development and by those administering the large Government research and development programs.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
