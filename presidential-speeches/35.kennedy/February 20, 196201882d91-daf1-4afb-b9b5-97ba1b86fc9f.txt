Telephone Conversation With Colonel Glenn Aboard the U.S.S. Noa
THE PRESIDENT. Hello?
Colonel Glenn: Hello, sir.
THE PRESIDENT. Colonel?
Colonel Glenn: This is Colonel Glenn.
THE PRESIDENT. Listen, Colonel, we are really proud of you, and I must say you did a wonderful job.
Colonel Glenn: Thanks, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT. We are glad you got down in very good shape. I have just been watching your father and mother on television, and they seemed very happy.
Colonel Glenn: It was a wonderful trip-almost unbelievable, thinking back on it right now. But it was really tremendous.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I am coming down to Canaveral on Friday, and hope you will come up to Washington on Monday or Tuesday, and we will be looking forward to seeing you there.
Colonel Glenn: Fine. I will certainly look forward to it.
Note: The President spoke from his office at the White House at 4:10 p.m.
