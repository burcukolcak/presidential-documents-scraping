Remarks Following the Orbital Flight of Col. John H. Glenn, Jr.
I know that I express the great happiness and thanksgiving of all of us that Colonel Glenn has completed his trip, and I know that this is particularly felt by Mrs. Glenn and their two children.
A few days ago, Colonel Glenn came to the White House and visited me. And he is--as are the other astronauts--the kind of American of whom we are most proud.
Some years ago, as a Marine pilot, he raced the sun across this country--and lost. And today he won.
I also want to say a word for all those who participated with Colonel Glenn at Canaveral. They faced many disappointments and delays--the burdens upon them were great-but they kept their heads and they made a judgment, and I think their judgment has been vindicated.
We have a long way to go in the space race. We started late. But this is the new ocean, and I believe the United States must sail on it and be in a position second to none.
Some months ago I said that I hoped every American would serve his country. Today Colonel Glenn served his, and we all express our thanks to him.
Note: The President spoke at 3:27 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White House.
