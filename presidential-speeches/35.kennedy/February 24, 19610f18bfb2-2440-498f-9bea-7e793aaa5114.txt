Statement by the President Following Settlement of the Airway Labor Dispute.
I AM GLAD to announce that the parties involved in the present airlines dispute, the Flight Engineers International Association and the Airlines Pilots Association, and the following carriers: Pan American World Airways, American Airlines, Trans World Airlines, Eastern Air Lines, National Airlines, Flying Tiger Lines, have all agreed to the proposal made by the Secretary of Labor on my behalf on Saturday, and that arrangements are now being made for prompt resumption of operations on these airlines.
The men are immediately available to return to work.
I want to thank all of the parties to the dispute for their cooperation in complying with the request. The Secretary will have a separate statement to make concerning Western Airlines.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
Note: A similar statement was recorded for the newsreels in the Fish Room at the White House at 4:30 p.m. on February 23, and was released to the press on that date. The earlier release, entitled "Remarks," differs only in its conclusion, which reads as follows:
"I want to thank all of the parties to the dispute for their cooperation in complying with this request, and I am most appreciative to Secretary Goldberg for his efforts in this regard.
"I am hopeful that these planes and these air lines will be back at work immediately--and we hope that if their operation schedules permit, by this evening."
Secretary Goldberg's statement recommended that the list of air carriers involved in the dispute also include Western Airlines.
