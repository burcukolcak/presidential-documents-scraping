Statement by the President Recorded for the Opening of the Red Cross Campaign.
[Broadcast over radio and television at 6 p.m.]
AS PRESIDENT of the United States and in accordance with custom I have designated the month of March as Red Cross Month, and as Honorary Chairman of the Red Cross I do want to ask the support of all of you for this most important drive.
The Red Cross has been chartered by the Congress to serve the people. It has come to the aid of our neighbor's when they have been struck by hurricanes. It aids our sons or brothers who may be in the service. It helps through its blood banks hundreds and even thousands of Americans who might otherwise have lost their lives if it had not been for the vigilance and the work of the Red Cross.
The Red Cross belongs to all Americans and I hope that all Americans will participate in supporting it this month. Over two million volunteers will be crossing the country in search of your support either through the United Fund itself or through the Red Cross drive.
This is a traditional work in which all of us have participated throughout all of our lives. It deserves our support in future months. The responsibilities placed upon it by our Government, by nature, by our hospitals, by our needs are great. I hope that all Americans will participate in supporting this year in March the Red Cross.
