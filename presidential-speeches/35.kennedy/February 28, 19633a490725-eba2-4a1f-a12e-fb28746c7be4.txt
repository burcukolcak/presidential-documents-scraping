Statement by the President Marking the Centenary of the Red Cross.
[ Recorded for the opening of the 1963 Red Cross campaign ]

ONE HUNDRED years ago in Geneva a group of men founded the International Red Cross. Now, in 1963, we have an opportunity to express our recognition of this century of service to mankind; our recognition and our gratitude.
As President of the United States and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, I have taken particular pleasure in proclaiming the month of March as Red Cross Month. I suppose no single organization touches the lives of so many millions of people at home and abroad.
The Red Cross emblem is respected everywhere as a symbol of health for all men and women and children, regardless of nationality or race. It silences guns on the battlefield and rushes help to the wounded. It fights the catastrophes of earthquakes and famine. It reunites families separated by war or political strife.
The emblem of the Red Cross is to be seen wherever humanity needs assistance. It is up to us and to people everywhere to hold this emblem as a symbol of hope here and around the world.
I urge you to give your Red Cross chapter special support in this centennial year and to do so proudly and generously.

Thank you very much.
