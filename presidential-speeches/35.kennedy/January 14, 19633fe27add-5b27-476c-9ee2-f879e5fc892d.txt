Statement by the President on the Death of President Sylvanus Olympio of Togo.
PRESIDENT Oiympio's tragic assassination is a blow to the progress of stable government in Africa. It is also a loss not only for his own country but for all those who knew him here in the United States. His visit in March 1962 was helpful in increasing our understanding of African problems and aspirations. His positive role in fostering cooperation between English- and French-speaking countries helped to promote peace and progress in Africa. His wise judgment and statesmanship will be missed by all nations which cherish human values and ideals.
Note: For an account of President Olympio's visit to Washington, see the 1962 volume, this series, Items 103, 104, 105.
