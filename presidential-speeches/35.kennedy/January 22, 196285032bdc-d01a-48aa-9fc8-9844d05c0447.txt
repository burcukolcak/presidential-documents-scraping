Statement by the President Concerning the Dominican Republic.
THE GOVERNMENT of the United States is encouraged by the present trend in the Dominican Republic, and the steps taken toward the restoration of orderly democratic processes in that country. The Dominican Republic people have gone through a difficult period which has had unfavorable, though temporary, economic repercussions. I have reviewed these problems with the United States Coordinator for the Alliance for Progress, Mr. Teodoro Moscoso, who, along with other experts, recently visited the Dominican Republic at my request.
As a result of this review and in view of the urgent nature of the Dominican Republic's balance of payment situation, the' United States is willing to make available up to $25 million as emergency credit.
