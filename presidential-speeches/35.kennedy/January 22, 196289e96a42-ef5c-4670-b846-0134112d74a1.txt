[Released January 22, 1962. Dated January 20, 1962]
Dear Mr. Ngala:
Thank you for your very kind letter regarding American famine relief for Kenya.
The American people were deeply moved by the reports of the suffering caused by the prolonged drought and the recent disastrous floods.
We are most happy to know that our food and assistance were timely and did much to alleviate the intense hardship caused by these disasters. I very much appreciate your thoughtfulness in writing to me on this matter.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[The Honorable Ronald Ngala, Leader of the House, Nairobi, Kenya]
Note: Mr. Ngala's letter, dated November 30, 1961, follows:
Dear Mr. President,
On behalf of the Government of Kenya, I would like to offer our most heartfelt thanks for all that your Government has done to assist us in famine relief. The misery and suffering that has been caused by this terrible disaster has been greatly alleviated by the generosity of the United States of America.
Three-hundred thousand bags of Maize which we have received, together with proportionate amounts of Milk Powder and Edible Oil, to say nothing of the free use of Hercules aircraft of the United States Air Force, amounts to an incredibly generous contribution.
I would like to convey our deepest gratitude.
Yours sincerely,
R. G. NGALA
