Statement by the President on the Death of Ernest Hemingway.
FEW AMERICANS have had a greater impact on the emotions and attitudes of the American people than Ernest Hemingway.
From his first emergence as one of the bright literary stars in Paris during the twenties--as a chronicler of the "Lost Generation," which he was to immortalize--he almost single-handedly transformed the literature and the ways of thought of men and women in every country in the world.

When he began to write--the American artist had to look for a home on the Left Bank of Paris. Today, the United States is one of the great centers of art. Although his journeys throughout the world--to France, to Spain and even to Africa--made him one of the great citizens of the world, he ended life as he began it--in the heartland of America to which he brought renown and from which he drew his art.
