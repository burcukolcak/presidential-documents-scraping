Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House Relating to the Research Functions of the Children's Bureau
Dear Mr.___________:
Transmitted herewith is a draft bill to authorize cooperative arrangements for research relating to maternal and child health services and crippled children's services. It complements the proposed legislation which I am submitting to you in a separate letter today, establishing an Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

The proposed legislation will enable the Children's Bureau to carry out more effectively its responsibilities pertaining to the welfare of children. At present, the Bureau may conduct its own research, but it may not make grants or enter into other cooperative financial arrangements with other institutions. The proposed legislation will provide the necessary flexibility to enable the Children's Bureau to use either its own facilities or those of others. The need for this authority is outlined in the attached letter from the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.
Without this legislation, the Children's Bureau is handicapped. I believe that handicap should be removed.

Sincerely yours,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
