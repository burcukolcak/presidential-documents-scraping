Remarks Upon Signing the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments.
IT IS a great pleasure for me to sign H.R. 6441, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1961 It is especially gratifying to sign this Act in the presence of the Members of Congress whose labors made this legislation possible.
I think this affords a more comprehensive and precise definition of the Federal government's role in controlling the pollution of our country's rivers and streams.
I think it is very important to all of us in this generation to pass on and perhaps even better the position of all the natural resources that we have, and this is particularly true with water.
I think only through an intensified attack by our communities, our States and by the national government, can we make real progress on this most vital national problem.
I therefore ask the Governors, our Mayors and our industrial leaders of the nation to pursue in dose cooperation with all of us, the important work in this area, and I know that all of us in Congress and in the Administration will continue to devote a good deal of attention to this matter. And I know that under the leadership of Secretary Ribicoff of HEW, that HEW will also continue to meet its responsibilities.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 6441 is Public Law 87-88 (75 Stat. 204).
