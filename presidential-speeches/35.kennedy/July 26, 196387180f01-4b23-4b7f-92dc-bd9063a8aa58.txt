Remarks to Members of the "99 Club" of Women Pilots Following Issuance of an Amelia Earhart Commemorative Stamp.
I WANT to express my thanks to Mrs. Noyes for this. I think when I saw this stamp--the Postmaster showed it to me--I thought that it was one of the finest stamps we have put out. And I am glad to welcome all of you to the White House.
I sometimes wonder whether we make as much use of all of our talent that we have in this country as we should. I think particularly of the hundreds of thousands and millions of women teachers, doctors, flyers, a whole variety of skills which they possess which I think we should use to the maximum. And I am concerned that we sometimes do not for one reason or another. We have had the Commission on Equal Rights for Women which has made some recommendations already, but it seems to me in a far more dramatic way, perhaps, than even a commission can show is this ceremony here which brings all of you to the White House, which shows to the people of our country the skills which you have, particularly very special skills.
I think that is very useful. It is useful for remembering Miss Earhart. It is useful also for our country, taking pride in what you do, and reminds our women that they ought to get out of the house into the air. So we are glad you are here.
Note: The President spoke at 9:30 a.m. in the Flower Garden at the White House. Mrs. Blanche Noyes, past president and one of the three organizers of the Ninety-Nines, Inc., made the presentation of a firstday cover of the commemorative 8-cent airmail stamp on behalf of the international organization of women pilots.
