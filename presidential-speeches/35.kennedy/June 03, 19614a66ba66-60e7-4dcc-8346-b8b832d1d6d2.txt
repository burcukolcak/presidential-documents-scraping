Remarks Upon Arrival at the Schwechat Airport in Vienna.
Mr. President:
I want to express my appreciation for your very generous welcome. Twenty years ago, 21 years ago, I spent nearly a month in Klagenfurt on the Worthersee in your beautiful country and, therefore, I am delighted to have an opportunity to visit here again. We are very grateful to the city of Vienna and to the Government of Austria for the hospitality which they have afforded us, for permitting us to meet on this most important occasion in an effort to improve the prospects for more general understandings between people.
So I wish to thank you again on behalf of my wife and myself and to say that we are proud to be in your country.

Thank you.


NOTE The President was greeted at the airport by President Adolf Scharf.
