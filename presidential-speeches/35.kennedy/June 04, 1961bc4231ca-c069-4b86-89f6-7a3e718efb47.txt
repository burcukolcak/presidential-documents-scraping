Remarks at the Airport in Vienna Upon Leaving for London.
Mr. President:
I want on behalf of my wife and myself and also the people of the United States to express our great appreciation to the Government of Austria, to you, sir, personally, and to the Mayor and to the people of Vienna.
Twenty-one years elapsed between my only two visits to this ancient city. I hope that less time will be in between the next visit.
I was anxious to come to this city and to this country because the experience of this country demonstrated how it was possible for problems to be solved in such a way that the interests of the people concerned could be protected. And therefore I thought it most appropriate that we meet in this city.
I want to again express my thanks to the people of Austria. They were extremely generous to my wife and to myself. I had not only the opportunity to see Mr. Khrushchev, the members of your government, but also to hear played the Tales of the Vienna Woods, so that it has been a very pleasant trip--and, unlike Marie Antoinette, I came from Versailles to Schonbrunn.

Thank you.
Note: The President's opening words referred to President Scharf.
