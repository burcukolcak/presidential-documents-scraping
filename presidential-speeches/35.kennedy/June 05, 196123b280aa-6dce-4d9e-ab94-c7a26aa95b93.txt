John F. Kennedy
June 05, 1961

Joint Statement Following Discussion With Prime Minister Macmillan.
AFTER HIS VISITS to Paris and Vienna, President Kennedy paid a short private visit to London on June 4 and 5. This gave the President the opportunity to review the world situation with the Prime Minister in the light of his talks with President de Gaulle and Mr. Khrushchev. The President and Mr. Macmillan were thus able to continue the close personal contact begun in Washington two months ago.
Their discussion covered the major problems, both economic and political, and revealed once again the close agreement of the two governments in pursuing their common purposes.
Occasion was given to review the need for economic collaboration and expansion in the general interest of developed and underdeveloped countries alike.
On Laos, the President and the Prime Minister noted with satisfaction the agreement in Vienna on the need for an effective cease fire which, in their opinion, should lead to progress in Geneva towards an agreement permitting the establishment of a neutral and independent Laos.
Particular attention was also given to the nuclear tests conference and to the question of disarmament.
The situation in regard to Germany was reviewed and there was full agreement on the necessity of maintaining the rights and obligations of the allied governments in Berlin.
Note: The statement was released in London.
