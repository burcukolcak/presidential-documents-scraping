Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House on Youth Employment Opportunities and Training.
My dear Mr.____________:
I am transmitting herewith a draft bill to provide useful employment and training on a pilot basis for young men and women between the ages of 16 and 22.
As set forth in more detail in the enclosed letter to me from the Secretary of Labor and the accompanying memorandum, this legislation would provide pilot programs over a three-year period, designed to develop the most effective methods of assisting our young people in acquiring the skills necessary for productive employment. The draft legislation would establish three different pilot programs through which young people can equip themselves for suitable employment: (1) on-the-job training; (2) a Youth Conservation Corps, and (3) local public service and public works programs performed in the areas in which the youths reside.
The progress we make as a Nation depends upon the use we make of our resources, including manpower. And it is especially important that our young people-the real key to our National future--be prepared to contribute to our economic growth.
Forecasts of the difficulty they can expect to meet in the next few years in finding suitable employment make it clear that we must act without delay. The approaches to this problem proposed in the attached draft will provide a solid base upon which an effective program can be built. We believe, too, that they will stimulate action by all elements of our communities, both public and private, in developing employment opportunities and training for our youth.
A letter similar to this is being sent to the Speaker of the House (President of the Senate).

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
