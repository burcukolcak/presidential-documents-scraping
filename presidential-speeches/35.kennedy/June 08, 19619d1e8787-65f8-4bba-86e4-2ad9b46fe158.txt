Remarks of Welcome to President Youlou of the Republic of Congo at the Washington National Airport.
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary, Lieutenant Sita:
I wish to express my great pleasure at this country being honored by your visit. You have played a most important and significant role in the most important event in the life of any country. And that is its emergence into a free, sovereign and independent status.
It is therefore a particular source of satisfaction to welcome you to the United States, which also many years ago passed through a similar experience, which has a comprehension of the things for which you stand and the things for which your country stands.
It is therefore a particular source of pleasure to me, Mr. President, to inform you that we recognize in your life and in your efforts and in your commitments, a strong passion for freedom for your own people and for people everywhere.
And therefore, Mr. President, you come to us today from a distant continent, but you come as a statesman whom we admire as a friend of freedom and as one who believes in increasing the cordial relations between your distinguished country and this country.
Mr. President, we're proud to have you here.
Note: The President's opening words referred to President Fulbert Youlou of the Republic of Congo, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and .Lt. Albert Sita of the Congolese Army, Aide-de-Camp to President Youlou.
