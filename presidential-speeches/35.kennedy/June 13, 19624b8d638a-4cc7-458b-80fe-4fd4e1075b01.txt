Message to Chairman Khrushchev following the formation of a Coalition Government in Laos.
[Released June 13, 1962. Dated June 12, 1962]
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I share your view that the reports from Laos are very encouraging. The formation of this Government of National Union under Prince Souvanna Phouma marks a milestone in the sustained efforts which have been put forward toward this end, especially since our meeting in Vienna.
It is of equal importance that we should now press forward, with our associates in the Geneva Conference, to complete these agreements and to work closely together in their execution. We must continue also to do our best to persuade all concerned in Laos to work together to this same end. It is very important that no untoward actions anywhere be allowed to disrupt the progress which has been made.
I agree that continued progress in the settlement of the Laotian problem can be most helpful in leading toward the resolution of other international difficulties. If together we can help in the establishment of an independent and neutral Laos, securely sustained in this status through time, this accomplishment will surely have a significant and positive effect far beyond the borders of Laos. You can count on the continued and energetic efforts of the Government of the United States toward this end.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
NOTE. In the first paragraph President Kennedy referred to Mr. Khrushchev's view on the Laotian situation as expressed in a message to the President dated June 12. The message is published in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 47, p. 12).
