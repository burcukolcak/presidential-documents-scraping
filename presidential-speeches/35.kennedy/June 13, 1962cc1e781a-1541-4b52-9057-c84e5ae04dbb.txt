Remarks Upon Signing Bill for Construction of the San Juan-Chama and Navajo Projects.
TODAY I have signed S. 107, a bill to authorize the Secretary of Interior to construct the San Juan-Chama Reclamation Project, and the Navajo Irrigation Project. By my natural resources and conservation message, I emphasized the importance of water resources development to the Nation, and expressed this administration's commitment to a sound and orderly program of new projects to meet accumulated needs.
The projects authorized in S. 107 were included among the major western water resource developments recommended in my conservation message as part of this program. These projects will provide major benefits to the West, and to the Nation as well as to the communities directly involved.
The Navajo Indian Irrigation Project will assist the Navajo people in making full use of their own resources to achieve a higher standard of living by providing employment opportunities in irrigation farming.
The San Juan-Chama Reclamation Project will provide water supplies needed to permit continued economic growth and development and stabilize an existing agricultural economy in the Rio Grande Basin of New Mexico.
These developments represent investments in the Nation's future that will provide major dividends in the years to come. I am especially pleased to approve this bill because I regard this legislation as the forerunner of additional authorization for western water resources development now pending in the Congress.
We are particularly glad to have the chairman of the Navajo Indian Tribe here representing the Navajo Tribe.
Note: The President spoke at 11 a.m. in his office at the White House. In his remarks he referred to Paul Jones, chairman of the Navajo Tribe.
As enacted, S. 107 is Public Law 87-483 (76 Stat. 96).
