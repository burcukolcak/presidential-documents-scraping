Remarks Upon Presenting the Collier Trophy to Admiral William F. Raborn, Jr.
I WANT to say what a great pleasure it is to welcome you here and to have an opportunity to participate in this ceremony honoring Admiral Raborn. It is a strange fact that this trophy which was designed 50 years ago to further the cause of aviation should now go to a man who has perhaps done more to further the cause of the defense of the United States through submarines, which shows where technology is taking us.
We are glad you're an aviator, Admiral. We are delighted that you are associated with a most important project. I think the fact that so many Americans from the Congress and from all the branches of our national defense are here today indicates the high regard in which they hold you.
We're very grateful to you for your work and it's most appropriate that this trophy should be presented to you and through you to the men who have developed the Polaris programs in both the Navy and industry. We're glad to see you, Admiral.
Note: The presentation ceremony was held in the Rose Garden at the White House.
