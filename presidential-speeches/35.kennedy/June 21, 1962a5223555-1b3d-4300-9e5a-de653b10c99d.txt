Statement by the President on the Settlement of the Trans World Airlines Labor Dispute.
I WAS very gratified to learn of the settlement this morning, after many long days and hours of arduous and constant bargaining, of the dispute between the flight Engineers International Association and Trans World Airlines.
This is a statesmanlike agreement and all who participated in it--the company officers, the union officials, and government representatives-are deserving of praise. The resolution of a problem of this type, involving a reduction in the size of crews, is of its nature a difficult matter. Here it has been resolved humanely in terms of the people involved and sensibly in terms of the industry involved. It is of great significance that this question was resolved without a strike. It is thus a good example of what can be accomplished in like situations.
I know I speak for the nation when I extend to the parties and to the mediation team, Secretary of Labor Arthur J. Goldberg, Under Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz, Chairman of the National Mediation Board Francis A. O'Neill, and Professor Nathan P. Feinsinger my heartiest congratulations on a difficult job well done and the public interest well served.
