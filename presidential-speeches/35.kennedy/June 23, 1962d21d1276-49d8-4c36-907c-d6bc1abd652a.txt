Statement by the President on the Dispute Between the flight Engineers and Eastern and Pan American World Airlines.
THE TWA settlement demonstrates that the strikes on Eastern and Pan American Airlines are unnecessary. The course was plainly open to all flight Engineer Chapters for a sensible and equitable resolution of the issues in dispute. The good offices of the government were and are fully available, as they were in the TWA dispute, to assist in such a resolution. Such a proffer was made last night by the National Mediation Board. It is most regrettable that this offer was spurned by the flight Engineers.
The way is still open for a sensible solution without the injury, both to the parties and the public, inherent in the present course of action. To persist in the strike course would be the height of irresponsibility on the part of the flight Engineers International Association and on the part of the Eastern and Pan American Chapters. It is a course clearly destructive to the best interests of the membership of the flight Engineers International Association.
Good judgment and even a minimum concern for the public interest require prompt termination of the strikes so that sensible collective bargaining and effective mediation can result in an equitable solution, as was provided in the TWA agreement.
I hope that good sense will prevail even at this late hour.
It goes without saying that all court orders issued in connection with this dispute must be obeyed.
