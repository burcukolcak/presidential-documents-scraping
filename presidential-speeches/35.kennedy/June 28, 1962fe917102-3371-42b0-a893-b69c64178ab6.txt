Statement by the President Upon Signing the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act.
I AM gratified that the Congress has acted affirmatively on my request of July 21, 1961, by enacting H.R. 8291 the "Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962."
I am personally grateful to the Chairman of the Senate foreign Relations Committee, Senator J. W. Fulbright, and to the Chairman of Subcommittee Number One of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Francis E. Walter, for their efforts in securing the passage of this legislation. With this expression of approval for the Administration's proposals to continue our assistance to refugees, the American people will be assured that this Government's leadership will be maintained in the great humanitarian endeavor of helping the world's stateless and homeless people. In continuing this endeavor, we will be carrying forward a great American tradition which is as well-known as the generosity of our people in coming to the aid of those in need.
The Congress is to be congratulated for its action in providing the necessary authorization. I am confident it will be equally responsive to the appropriation requests which will be submitted to implement the programs which it has endorsed in this bill.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 8291 is Public Law 87-510 (76 Stat. 121).
For the President's request of July 21, 1961, proposing reorganization and reenactment of refugee aid legislation, see the 1961 volume, this series, page 526.
