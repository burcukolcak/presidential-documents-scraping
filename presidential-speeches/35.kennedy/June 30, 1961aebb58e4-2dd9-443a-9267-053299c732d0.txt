Statement by the President Upon Signing the Social Security Amendments of 1961.
IT IS with great satisfaction that I have signed into law the Social Security Amendments of 1961. They represent an additional step toward eliminating many of the hardships resulting from old age, disability, or the death of the family wage-earner.
A nation's strength lies in the well-being of its people. The Social Security program plays an important part in providing for families, children, and older persons in times of stress. But it cannot remain static. Changes in our population, in our working habits, and in our standard of living require constant revision.
I am pleased that the Congress has acted so promptly this year to modernize the program. It has done so with commendable regard for the sound principles on which social insurance must be based--for the legislation is both financially sound and socially responsible.
With these amendments, the Social Security program will be a more effective instrument.
Note: The Social Security Amendments of 1961 is Public Law 87-64 (75 Stat. 131).
