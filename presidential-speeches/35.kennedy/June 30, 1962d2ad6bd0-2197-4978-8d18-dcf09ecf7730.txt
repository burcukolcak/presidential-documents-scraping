Message to King Mwami Mwambutsa IV on the Occasion of the Independence of Burundi.
[Released June 30, 1962. Dated June 28, 1962]
Your Majesty:
It gives me the greatest pleasure to extend to Your Majesty, and to the government and people of the kingdom of Burundi, the congratulations of the government and the people of the United States on the attainment of independence by Burundi.
We in the United States have watched with interest the transition of Burundi from its status as a UN Trust Territory to independence as a sovereign state. We know that your people, like ours, cherish individual liberty and national independence. Therefore, we share with the people of Burundi the knowledge that these goals are achieved and can be maintained only at the cost of unremitting labor and sacrifice.
Americans also share with the people of Burundi a 'profound respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter. We look forward to your participation in world councils as befits a sovereign nation.
The people of the United States of America will work to strengthen the bonds of friendship between our two countries. We anticipate a future in which our two peoples shall work together in the cause of freedom, dignity and peace.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[His Majesty Mwami Mwambutsa IV, Usumbura, Burundi]
