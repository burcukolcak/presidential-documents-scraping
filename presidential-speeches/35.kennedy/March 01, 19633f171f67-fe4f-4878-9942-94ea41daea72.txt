Remarks to a Group of Staff Members and Students of the Argentine War College.
Ambassador, gentlemen:
I want to express our very warm welcome to all of you. Many years ago, when I was a student, I spent two weeks in Cordova in the Argentine, so I know something about your country, and I am particularly glad to welcome you here.
We are particularly glad to have the members of the military forces of the Argentine here, because we are very grateful to you for your support during the difficulties which we had in October in the Caribbean with Cuba. The fact that the Argentine immediately not only supported the effort in the OAS, but also sent air and naval forces to assist in the quarantine was important not only because of the forces involved, but also because it indicated symbolically, though the Argentine was far away, many thousands of miles, the communications were long, it indicated a sense of solidarity which was very valuable to us not only in this hemisphere, but, I think, in maintaining our posture throughout the world.
And this is particularly appreciated, because several Argentine soldiers lost their lives as a result of the air crash which was tied to the activities of that operation. We have a good deal of unfinished business in this hemisphere and I think it's important that in the days to come as we attempt to protect this hemisphere from foreign subversion and foreign activities directed against the liberties of this hemisphere, that the Argentine and the United States stay closely together.
So we are glad you came. We are very proud to have you here. You have a great military tradition in your country and I am particularly proud, as President of the United States, to welcome you to the White House. Viva Argentina!
Note: The President spoke at noon in the Flower Garden at the White House. In his opening words he referred to Roberto T. Alemann, Ambassador to the United States from Argentina.
