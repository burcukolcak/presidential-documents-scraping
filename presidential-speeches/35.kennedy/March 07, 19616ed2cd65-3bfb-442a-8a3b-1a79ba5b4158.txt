Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House on Federal Aid to Colleges and Universities.
Dear Mr.____________:
I am transmitting herewith drafts of two bills designed to carry out recommendations set forth in my message of February 20th to the Congress for assistance to institutions of higher education. One bill provides for the construction of academic facilities and for undergraduate scholarships. The other bill provides for housing facilities for the students.
I consider enactment of this legislation vital. In the years ahead there will be great increases in the number of students seeking matriculation at our colleges and universities. If our youth are to have an opportunity to develop their intellectual capacities to the fullest, steps must be taken immediately to increase the available facilities for higher education and to relieve both the students and the universities from impossible financial burdens. This program is designed to do this.
Enclosed are letters from the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and from the Housing and Home Finance Agency Administrator describing the two proposals in more detail. I consider the need critical and the program urgent.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
