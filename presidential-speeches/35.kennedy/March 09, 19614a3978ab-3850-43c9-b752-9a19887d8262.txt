Statement by the President Concerning the Interdepartmental Committee for the Voluntary Payroll Savings Plan.
THIS COMMITTEE has carried out its mission in a most commendable way since its inception in April 1942 and has firmly established a widespread thrift program of outstanding merit and popularity in the Federal Government.
It is important to the welfare of our Country that this support of the national debt management function be maintained and fostered to the greatest extent possible. Federal employees, officers and military personnel should be encouraged to show leadership in the purchase of Savings Bonds through the Payroll Savings Plan and thus by, example continue to give impetus to the movement throughout the business and industrial structure of the Nation.
Note: This statement is part of a White House release announcing the appointment of Mrs. Elizabeth Rudel Smith, Treasurer of the United States, as Chairman of the Committee. The release added that the statement was derived from a letter to the heads of Federal departments and agencies.
