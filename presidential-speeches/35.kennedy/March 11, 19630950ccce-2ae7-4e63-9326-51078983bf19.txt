Remarks to the Boys' and Men's Choir of Poznan, Poland.
Boys:
We express our very warm welcome to you here--if not by the weather at least by our personal sentiments. We have heard the best things about you since you have arrived in our country.
I am delighted that you are going to tour the United States. And I am delighted that the songs that you sing, which stretch back really as part of your repertoire over a period of 500 years, are the best in the great traditions of your country and all of the influences which have played such a powerful part in making the character of the Polish people.

So we are very glad to have you here. I think you will find as you go around the United States that there is no country or people for whom my countrymen have a stronger feeling of admiration for than the people of Poland. So, in representing them, you come to a friendly country.
I am glad that Senator Hart and Congressman Rooney arranged for you to visit the White House, and perhaps you could sing a song for us, if you would.
Note: The President spoke at 9:30 a.m. in the Flower Garden at the White House, following which the choir performed briefly for him. In his closing words he referred to Senator Philip A. Hart of Michigan and Representative John J. Rooney of New York.
