Joint Statement With the President of Mexico Concerning the Salinity of Waters Delivered Under the 1944 Treaty.
THE PRESIDENTS of the United States and Mexico are agreed that it is urgent to find a mutually satisfactory solution to the salinity problem.
To this end, the Presidents of both countries, through their respective foreign Offices, have given instructions to their representatives in the International Boundary and Water Commission to recommend within 45 days the measures which should be taken.
In order to carry out these instructions in the most effective way the Commissioners are to avail themselves of qualified water and soil scientists.
The objective of the two Governments is, without prejudice to the legal rights of either country, to agree upon and actually put into operation remedial measures within the shortest possible period of time.
