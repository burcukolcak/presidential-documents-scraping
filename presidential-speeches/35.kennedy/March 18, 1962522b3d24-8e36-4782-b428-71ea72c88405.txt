Statement by the President on the French-Algerian Cease-fire Agreement.
THE UNITED STATES supports these efforts toward a mutually beneficial solution and welcomes the agreement. It provides a sound basis for a friendly and fruitful relationship between Algeria and France and it presents an opportunity for all residents of Algeria to contribute constructively toward the future.
The conclusions of the cease-fire agreement between French authorities and representatives of the f. L. N. is an historic accomplishment made possible by the vision, statesmanship and moderation demonstrated by all concerned.
It is to be hoped that the opportunity will be quickly seized and that the wisdom in which the agreement was achieved will prevail in its execution. The United States is convinced that in this direction lies the path for a promising future.
