Remarks at the Ambassador's Residence, San Jose, in Response to a Welcoming Declaration by Christian Democratic Youth
I WANT to express my thanks to all of you.
One of our difficulties has been that while the great majority of the people have supported the cause of freedom, the Communists, representing a very small minority, have worked extremely hard, have been well organized, have been willing to undertake the disciplines which go with their form of subversion and with their form of tyranny.
One of our great challenges has been to develop in the free community a greater dedication, a greater willingness to work, a greater organizational sense, and a willingness to undertake all the laborious tasks which go with maintaining freedom and which are more important than all the speeches.
This group of young men and women, who represent a good many others, by working to secure the 500,000 signatures, which represents a tremendous labor, from the people of Costa Rica, committing them to the success of the Alliance for Progress, to the success of our common cause, I think gives me the greatest possible encouragement that, particularly in the students, Costa Rica, and in the other free countries of the hemisphere, that we are producing the kind of dedicated freedom fighters who can outwork the Communists and in the final analysis bring success to our cause.
So I am delighted to have you all here, representing, as you do, our best hopes for this hemisphere. We want to express our thanks to particularly all those who are in these clubs. Thank you very much.
I think there were a couple of people from the labor unions. Where are they?
You are from the Banana Workers, and you are from the Industrial Workers.
Well, we want to express our great welcome to those who are working in the trade union movement, which is essential for a progressive democracy, so we are glad to have you here today.
Thank you.
