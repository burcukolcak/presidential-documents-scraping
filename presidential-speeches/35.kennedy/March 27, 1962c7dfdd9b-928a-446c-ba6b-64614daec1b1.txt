Proclamation 3459â€”National Highway Week, 1962

Whereasour Nation, with its expanding economy and growing population, is largely dependent on its highway network for the safe and efficient movement of people and goods; and
Whereasthe inadequacies of our present highway network are responsible in large degree for one of the great American tragedies of our time--the costly and inexcusable annual toll of deaths and injuries on the highways; and
Whereasthe Congress, at my request, last year made financial provision for completing the finest road network the world has ever seen, geared to our future as well as present needs; and
Whereasthe American people should be reminded of their vital interest in this program and the boundless benefits it will produce:
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of May 20-26, 1962, as National Highway Week in recognition of the vital role of highway transportation in our way of life; and I urge the Governors of the States and mayors of cities to issue similar proclamations.
I also ask the appropriate officials of the Federal, State, and local governments, as well as public and private organizations and the general public, to join in observance of this significant occasion.
During this period I encourage all Americans to consider and appreciate the value of highway transportation to their own activities and to our national welfare.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-seventh day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth.
