Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House on Compensation Rates for Veterans Injured in the Service
[Released May 2, 1961 Dated April 27, 1961]
Dear Mr._____________:
In my recent message on budget and fiscal policy I recommended that the Congress enact selective increases in compensation rates for veterans with service-connected disabilities, to offset rises in the cost of living since the last increase in 1957 and to adjust rates in categories which are out of line. The American people have traditionally insisted that those veterans who were injured in the service of their Nation be treated justly and humanely--a policy which will be carried out by this Administration.

The Administrator of Veterans Affairs has prepared and submitted to me a draft of legislation which implements the recommendation in my message. I believe this approach which gives greater increases to those veterans with the more severe injuries is fair and reasonable. I am, therefore, transmitting the Administrator's letter of justification and the accompanying draft bill. I strongly recommend early enactment of this legislation by the Congress.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
