Statement by the President on the Death of Per Jacobsson.
ALL MANKIND owes a vast debt to Per Jacobsson, who has been a towering figure in the world for more than 40 years. His role in international affairs has been unique, both in the building of a strong international monetary system and in the creation of a broad public understanding to support and strengthen it. He combined with his incomparable professional talents a warmth and wit and depth of understanding that enabled him to give leadership to other men of good will in meeting the problems of our troubled times. We of the United States, who have had the privilege of having him live among us for many years, will sorely miss him.
Note: Mr. Jacobsson, a citizen of Sweden, served as Managing Director and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, International Monetary Fund, from December 19, 1956, until his death on May 5, 1963.
