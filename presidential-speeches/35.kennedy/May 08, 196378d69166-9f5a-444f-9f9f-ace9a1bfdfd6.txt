Greetings Telephoned to President Truman on the Occasion of His 79th Birthday.
THE PRESIDENT. President Truman?

President Truman: Yes.
THE PRESIDENT. I want to join your other friends in expressing congratulations to you on your 79th birthday.
President Truman: Thank you, Mr. President. You are as kind as you can be. It is a surprise and a very great satisfaction to me to have you call.
THE PRESIDENT. I must say that I share the view of the country that you can't be 79 when you can outwalk Bobby and outtalk Hubert. I think we can look for a lot more good years.
President Truman: Thank you very, very, very much.
THE PRESIDENT. You express to everybody there our warm regards and also tell them how proud we are of you.
President Truman: You know how much I appreciate your interest in this thing. It just overwhelms me. I don't know what to say.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very much,

Mr. President. We will see you soon, I hope.

President Truman: Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT. Goodbye.
