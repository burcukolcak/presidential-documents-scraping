Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House Transmitting Bill Implementing the 23d Amendment to the Constitution
[Released May 16, 1961. Dated May 14, 1961]
Dear Mr._____________:
I am pleased to transmit to the Congress draft legislation implementing the 23d Amendment to the Constitution, providing for voting by the residents of the District of Columbia in Presidential elections.
The passage of the 23d Amendment by the Congress and its remarkably prompt ratification by the required number of States reaffirms the belief of the people of the entire Nation in the basic principle that government must be responsible to those governed. I take special pride, therefore, in submitting this proposal to permit the greatest possible number of citizens of the District of Columbia to share with their fellow Americans the basic right to vote for President and Vice President of the United States.
I hope that prompt and favorable action will be taken by the Congress on the proposed legislation so that the long-standing aspirations of the citizens of the District of Columbia to participate in national elections finally will become a reality.
In addition to the draft bill, I am enclosing a letter from the President of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia describing this legislation in detail. A similar letter has been sent to the Speaker (President of the Senate).

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
Note: This is the text of identical letters addressed to the Honorable Lyndon B. Johnson, President of the Senate, and to the Honorable Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House of Representatives.
The President approved the bill on October 4, 1961 (Public Law 87-389, 75 Stat. 817).
