Statement by the President on the Arbitration of the Pan American Airways Labor Dispute.
THE ARBITRATION award handed down today in the dispute between Pan American World Airways and the Air Line Pilots Association is a concrete step toward settlement of the difficult problems which have plagued the airline industry for several years.
The parties are to be commended for seeking a solution to their differences through voluntary arbitration, thus benefiting the employees and carriers involved and the public by averting a shutdown in operations of a vital section of the industry.
I wish especially to commend and thank the outstanding members of the arbitration panel--Dr. George W. Taylor, its chairman, and Edgar F. Kaiser and George Meany-for their willingness to devote their talent, time, and effort to this important assignment. They have performed a valuable public service.
Note: On April 16, a strike having been called to begin at midnight, the President appealed to the airline and to the pilots association to continue operations and to submit to arbitration the unresolved questions concerning the reduction of the crew on turbo-jets from 4 to 3 men. On April 18 the President announced .that both parties had accepted his proposal.
