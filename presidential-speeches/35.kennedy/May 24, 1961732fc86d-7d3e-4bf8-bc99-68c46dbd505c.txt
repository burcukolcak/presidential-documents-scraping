Statement by the President Following a Meeting With Roberto T. Alemann, Minister of Economy of Argentina.
THE UNITED STATES has long had deep ties of friendship with the people of Argentina. In the past we have worked together to raise living standards and to defend the freedom of all of the American States. If the 1960's are to be a decade of progress for the Americas--if we are to bring increasing economic progress and social justice under freedom to our entire hemisphere-then we must rely, in substantial part, on the future cooperative efforts of the governments of Argentina and the United States. We in the United States hope to work with the Argentine government in its heroic effort to improve the welfare of its people, for we are committed to the long range economic development of Argentina. Even more important, we are committed to a continuing relationship of friendship, partnership and mutual respect.
Together Argentina and the United States can work not only to solve their own problems but to improve the life of free men in this hemisphere and throughout the world. For the United States and the cause of freedom has no stronger or more respected friends than the people of Argentina.
