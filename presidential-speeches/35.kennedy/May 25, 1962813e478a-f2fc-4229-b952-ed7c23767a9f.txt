Letter to Secretary Goldberg Upon Receiving His Report on the federal Employee-Management Relations Program.
[Released May 25, 1962. Dated May 24, 1962]
Dear Mr. Secretary:
I am most gratified to learn more of the progress of the Employee-Management Relations Program. Executive Order 10988 on Employee-Management Cooperation in the federal Service is an essential part of our effort to bring new vigor and creativity to the public service.
I appreciate that in any new program such as this one there will be problems of adjustment and transition that must be met. I am confident that they can be resolved satisfactorily and that progress will continue to be achieved in establishing the best possible relationship between the federal Government and its employees.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
Note: Executive Order 10988, issued by the President on January 17, 1962 (27 F.R. 551), dealt with the rights of federal employees "to form, join, and assist any employee organization, or to refrain from any such activity." The order also established a Temporary Committee on the Implementation of the federal Employee-Management Program.
In his report to the President, Secretary Goldberg, who served as Chairman of the Committee, stated that "our object is to bring about meaningful and fruitful relations between employee organizations and the Government." He reported that meetings were being held throughout the Nation to discuss the new program, and that all concerned had been counseled to represent their organizations or agencies with vigor and clarity, "for only in that way will the best interests of all the parties be furthered" He added that emphasis had been placed on the affirmative spirit of the President's order--that "we want real unions and real management. We are well on our way to that goal."
Secretary Goldberg's report, in the form of a letter dated April 20, was also made public.
