Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House Concerning the Training of Workers in New Occupational Skills
Dear Mr.____________:
I am transmitting herewith a draft of a bill designed to carry out the recommendation contained in my Message of May 25 to the Congress providing for the training and retraining of several hundred thousand workers in new occupational skills over a 4-year period.
The need for prompt enactment of this legislation is clear. As I stated in my Message, this measure is of special importance in abating unemployment and achieving full use of our resources, as well as in meeting the occupational demands of our Nation's expanded defense, space, aid, and trade programs.
The unemployed whose skills have been rendered obsolete by automation and other technological changes must be equipped with new skills enabling them to become productive members of our society once again. The skills of other workers must also be improved to enable them to meet the more demanding requirements of modern industry.
Also enclosed is a letter sent me by the Secretary of Labor describing the legislation more fully, and a memorandum explaining the draft bill in detail. A similar letter is being sent the Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Sincerely,

JOHN F.KENNEDYY
