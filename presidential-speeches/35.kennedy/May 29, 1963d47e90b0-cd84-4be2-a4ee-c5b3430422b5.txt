Telegram Inviting Business Leaders to the White House To Discuss Problems of Minority Groups.
AT FIVE O'CLOCK on Tuesday, June 4, I am meeting with a group of business leaders to discuss some aspects of the difficulties experienced by minority groups in many of our cities in securing employment and equal access to facilities and services generally available to the public. These subjects merit serious and immediate attention and I would be pleased to have you attend the meeting to be held in the East Room of the White House. Please advise whether you will be able to attend.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
