Statement by the President on the Death of Francis E. Walter.
I AM saddened to hear of the death of Congressman Francis E. Walter. When I saw him on my recent visit to the hospital he was facing the future with the same faith and courage he had shown throughout his life. He will be greatly missed in the House of Representatives and all of his friends mourn his passing.
