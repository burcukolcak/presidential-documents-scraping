Message to the President of the Inter-Parliamentary Council.
Dear Mr. Codacci-Pisanelli:
I have received with appreciation your letter enclosing the text of a resolution adopted by the 51st Inter-Parliamentary Conference at Brasilia concerning threats to world peace arising out of the Cuban situation and the Sino-Indian conflict.
My country and its people would suffer perhaps more than any others in the event of a major breach of world peace. Hence, we have as great an incentive as any state to do all in our power to preserve this peace. To that end we have moved together with our sister republics in this hemisphere, through the OAS, as well as in the United Nations, to bring an end to the new and serious threat to peace created by the rapid and secret introduction of offensive weapon systems with nuclear capability into Cuba by the Soviet government. We are gratified that Chairman Khrushchev has agreed to withdraw these weapons from this hemisphere. The actions now being taken to implement this decision may, if successful, lead to the liquidation of this threat as well as the possibility of steps to abate other tensions endangering world peace.
With regard to the conflict on the Sino-Indian frontier, I deplore this further instance of armed aggression by Communist China and hope that that state can be persuaded to abandon its flagrant violation of the territorial integrity of its neighbors.
I would appreciate your reading this message to the plenary session of the IPU Conference.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
