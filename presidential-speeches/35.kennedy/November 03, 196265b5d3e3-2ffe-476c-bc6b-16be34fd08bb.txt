Statement by the President Urging Citizens To Vote on Election Day.
My fellow citizens:
In these difficult days. in the life of our country, I know that every American asks what he can do. All of us cannot serve in our Armed Forces or in the Government, but there is one thing that each of us can do, and that is to take part in our democracy, to participate in it, and we can do that on Tuesday, November 6th, which is Election Day.
People all over the world who desire freedom look to the United States. The best evidence that we can give of how strongly we believe in freedom is by voting on Tuesday, November 6th, for the candidate and the party of our choice. This is the way that we can show how strongly we believe in our country, how strongly we work for it, how strong we want it to be--by voting on Tuesday, November 6th.
