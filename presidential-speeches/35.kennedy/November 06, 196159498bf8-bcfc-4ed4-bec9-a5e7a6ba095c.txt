Message to President Kekkonen of Finland on His Departure From the United States.
[Released November 6, 1961 Dated November 2, 1961]
Dear Mr. President:
Upon the conclusion of your visit to the United States, I wish on behalf of all Americans to extend to you and the Finnish people our most cordial good wishes for the continued prosperity and well-being of Finland.
The reaction of my fellow countrymen to your presence here has once again shown the depth of our feelings of admiration and esteem for Finland. Your nation, though small in size compared with many others, is peopled with lovers of freedom whose hearts are of giant proportion.
As you have journeyed through our land, I trust you have gained greater knowledge of our unrelenting determination. Americans are united in their resolve to meet with calmness and purpose the problems posed by forces which challenge not only the United States but indeed the whole community of nations sharing democratic institutions. We will never cease our efforts in pursuit of peace with justice for all mankind.
As you depart from our shores, please be assured of our continuing interest. in Finland's welfare, and of our awareness of the value of the shared ideals and bonds of friendship linking our countries.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[His Excellency, Urho Kekkonen, President of Finland, Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, Calif.]
