Telegram to Constantine Caramanlis Following His Reappointment as Prime Minister of Greece
Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I wish to convey my sincere greetings and best wishes to Their Majesties, the Greek people and yourself and to congratulate you on the occasion of your reappointment and investiture as Prime Minister of Greece.
Recalling your recent visit to the United States with pleasure and satisfaction, I am confident that in these troubled times our two nations will continue to work together in the spirit of firm friendship which has traditionally characterized Greek and American relations. As a common aim, we seek a peaceful world based on the ideals of freedom, liberty and democracy which Greece has bequeathed to the world.

Please accept my warmest personal regards.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
