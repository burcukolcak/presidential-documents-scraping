Remarks to Delegates to a Committee of the Universal Postal Union.
Ladies and gentlemen:
I am delighted to welcome you to the United States. I understand this is the first time in more than 65 years that this country has been the host to this organization, and it is a source of satisfaction to us that this organization took its present form during the administration of President Abraham Lincoln 100 years ago.
That so many countries are able to cooperate so successfully in moving mail which in essence, of course, is communication between people, I think, should be a source of pride to us all wherever we live. I hope this kind of intimate association, cooperation for the benefit of all of our people, may be extended to other fields.
We welcome you to this House which is identified with major periods in American history, and I regard this as one of the most satisfying. You are very welcome here.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. We appreciate the stamps, and if you will write me, I'll collect some more from all your countries. Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 9:30 a.m. in the Flower Garden at the White House to delegates of the 1963 session of the Management Council of the Consultative Committee for Postal Studies. The group was in Washington for a 2-week conference to study common problems of postal organization and economics.
