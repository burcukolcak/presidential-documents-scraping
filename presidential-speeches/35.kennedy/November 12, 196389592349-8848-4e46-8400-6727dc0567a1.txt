John F. Kennedy
November 12, 1963

Letter to the President, D.C. Board of Commissioners, Concerning Highway Projects.
Dear Mr. Tobriner:
I am pleased to have your letter of November 7, 1963, transmitting the recommendations of the Policy Advisory Committee with respect to the North Leg of the Inner Loop and the additional Central City Potomac River Crossing, and advising me that the Board of Commissioners concurs in those recommendations.
The recommendations are likewise acceptable to me, and will be included in my budget recommendations to the Congress in January.
The Policy Advisory Committee is an example of the possibilities for cooperative action among Federal and District agencies in resolving difficult problems, and the fact that its recommendations are unanimous is particularly gratifying. The concurrence of the Board of Commissioners in those recommendations should assure that the entire District Highway Program can now move forward.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[Honorable Walter N. Tobriner, President, Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.]
Note: The Policy Advisory Committee was an ad hoe committee established at the President's request to review problems as to the location of the facilities to which the President's letter refers. The Committee, taking into account "both paramount human displacement and aesthetic problems as well as other social and economic values" recommended that, with respect to the North Leg, "maximum consideration should be given to the concept of tunneling." With respect to the proposed new bridge, the Committee recommended that it be located south of Key Bridge and north of Theodore Roosevelt Island.
