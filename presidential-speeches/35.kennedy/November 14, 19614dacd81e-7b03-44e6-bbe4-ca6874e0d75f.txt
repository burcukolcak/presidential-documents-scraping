Remarks at the Swearing In of Teodoro Moscoso as Assistant Administrator for Latin America, AID.
MR. AMBASSADOR, I want again to express my great pleasure at your willingness to assume this responsibility, after having been Ambassador to Venezuela. And I think the fact that we asked you to come back from there to assume this new duty indicates the great importance we place on it.
Our economic efforts in this hemisphere will be directed through the Alliance for Progress, and through you, working under the guidance of Mr. Fowler Hamilton and the Secretary of State. We want everyone to know in this hemisphere that we are proceeding ahead and are going to make a major effort to accomplish the task we set out to do.
So that symbolically it's a pleasure to participate in this ceremony with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and with the Ambassadors from the countries who are so intimately a part of our lives.

Gentlemen, we're glad you came today, and we're very grateful that you came under the conditions you did, and Ambassador Woodward I know joins in expressing his satisfaction with this decision.

Thank you very much.
Note: The ceremonies were held in the Fish Room at the White House. During his remarks the President referred to Fowlcr Hamilton, Administrator of the Agency for International Development, and Robert F. Woodward, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs.
