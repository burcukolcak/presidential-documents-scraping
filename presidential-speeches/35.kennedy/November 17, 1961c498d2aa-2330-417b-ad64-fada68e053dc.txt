Remarks Upon Arrival at the Airport in Phoenix.
THANK YOU, Governor. I want to express my pleasure at coming back again to Arizona, and particularly coming back on an occasion which I think has so much significance, as this does.
Arizona, which is comparatively speaking a young State, is represented in the United States Senate by a Senator who has been so intimate a part of the life of this State.

So, in saluting Senator Hayden for 50 years of devoted service, we also salute Arizona and the Southwest and the best of the United States.
Thank you for the warm welcome, and I share your pride and satisfaction in the work of this State and in the work of a man so intimately identified with it.

And thank you for coming to the airport.
Note: In the President's opening words he referred to Paul Fannin, Governor of Arizona.
