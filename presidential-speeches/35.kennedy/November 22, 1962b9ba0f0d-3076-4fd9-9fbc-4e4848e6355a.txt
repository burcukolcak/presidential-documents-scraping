Statement by the President Announcing Accelerated Payment of National Service Life Insurance Dividends.
I HAVE today asked the Veterans Administration to advance the payment of the 1963 dividend of $222 million on National Service Life Insurance policies and $15.6 million for holders of United States Government Life Insurance policies so that all dividends will be paid during the month of January rather than being spread out during the entire year of 1963.
In addition, a special dividend of $90 million has been declared for holders of the National Service policies.
Both the accelerated and the special dividends will be completely paid by a single check to all those who are eligible during January, 1963.

The total of $327.6 million paid in the month of January should, because of its nearness to the Christmas season, be of special interest to the families of those involved and at the same time provide a needed boost to the economy.
