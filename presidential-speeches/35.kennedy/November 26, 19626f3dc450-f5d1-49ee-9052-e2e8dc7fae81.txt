Statement by the President on the Reconvening of the Geneva Disarmament Conference.
THE 18-Nation Disarmament Conference resumes its deliberations in Geneva today. This is as it should be. The crucial developments within recent weeks have served to confirm both the need and urgency of the task before it.
It is clear that a renewed and immediate effort must be made to halt the constantly increasing tempo of the arms race if there is to be assurance of a lessening of the danger of war. It is, therefore, my continued hope that serious negotiations will proceed at once on those initial measures of disarmament which could, if put into effect without delay, materially improve international security and enhance the prospects for further disarmament progress.

Among these measures we believe high priority should be given to the conclusion of an effective agreement which would end once and for all tests of nuclear weapons. The United States has completed its recent series of atmospheric tests. There is hope that the Soviet Union evidently will soon conclude its series of atmospheric tests. This suggests that a moment may be at hand to initiate the beginning of the end of the upward spiral of weapons competition. If so, the opportunity must not be lost.
It is important that these negotiations now move forward and that concrete progress be achieved. To this end, I pledge anew my personal and continuing interest in the work of the Conference.
