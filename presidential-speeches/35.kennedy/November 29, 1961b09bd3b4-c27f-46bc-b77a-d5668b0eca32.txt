Remarks at the Swearing In of John McCone as Director, Central Intelligence Agency.
I WANT to say what an honor it is and what a pleasure it is to have Mr. McCone back in the national service.
This appointment--I think that he was willing to take it indicates how important it is, and how important I feel it is, as well as members of the Government and Members of Congress believe it to be.
He has not only the responsibility as Director of CIA, but also coordinating the work of all the Intelligence community, and I know that he will give his attention to both these functions upon which so much of our security depends.
We want to welcome you here and to say that you are now living on the bull's-eye, and I welcome you to that spot.
Note: The ceremonies were held in the Cabinet Room at the White House.
