Remarks at the Swearing In of Fowler Hamilton as Administrator of the Agency for International Development.
I WANT to express our great pleasure at participating in the swearing in of Mr. Fowler Hamilton to be the head of the new AID program. And it is a great pleasure to have the Justice join us in making this ceremony legal.
Mr. Hamilton assumes a major responsibility, and I am delighted that he has accepted it. Our hopes are very high for this Agency, and I think that his assumption of responsibility gets us off to a most promising start.
I am glad that the members of his family are here also.
Note: The President spoke in the Fish Room at the White House. In his opening remarks he referred to Justice Charles E. Whittaker, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
