Memorandum of Disapproval of Bill Relating to Longevity Step Increases for Postal Employees.
I AM withholding my approval from S. 1459, a bill "To amend the provisions of law relating to longevity step increases for postal employees."
While the supporters of this legislation are well-intentioned and its objectives sound--improvement of the within-grade provisions of the postal pay structure, and better correlation of these provisions with the related provisions affecting employees paid under the Classification Act--this bill does not achieve these objectives, despite its $60 million annual cost. Moreover, the Congress failed to provide--through enactment of the postal rate increases recommended by this Administration and its predecessor--the revenues necessary to cover the current postal deficit, much less a deficit of even greater magnitude. Without new revenues this bill would increase the postal deficit to over 800 million dollars.
The classified and postal pay structures, including the longevity and within-grade provisions are in need of extensive revision, and will receive the sympathetic consideration of this Administration, with recommendations to be forthcoming at the next session of the Congress. The reforms needed are fundamental and sweeping and will require the most careful consideration by both the Executive Branch and the Congress. However, budgetary needs are too urgent to permit approval of this measure unattended by revenue increases, at this time.
