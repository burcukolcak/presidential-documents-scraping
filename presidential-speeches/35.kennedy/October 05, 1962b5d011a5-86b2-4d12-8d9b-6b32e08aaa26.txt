Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Relating to Suits Against Government Officials.
I HAVE today signed H.R. 1960 which corrects an historic anomaly in the jurisdiction of the United States courts. While the bill creates no new remedies, it will extend to all district courts the same jurisdiction heretofore enjoyed solely by the District Court for the District of Columbia to hear actions in the nature of mandamus against Government officials. Thus it will no longer be necessary for citizens throughout the country to come to the District of Columbia to maintain actions against government officials.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
Note: As enacted, H.R. 1960 is Public Law 87-748 (76 Stat. 744).
