Statement by the President on the 1965 Meeting in Washington of the Pan American Congress of Architects.
I HAVE been most pleased to learn that the Eleventh Pan American Congress of Architects will for the first time assemble in this country and in our Capital City in 1965. As President, I wish to extend to all the members of the Pan American Federation of Architectural Associations this country's welcome and appreciation for meeting in Washington, D.C.
Architecture and new approaches to urban planning are common themes in the life of all the countries of this hemisphere. It is a segment of human thought and creativity in which all citizens of the Americas may share and deepen their understanding and appreciation of one another.
The Festival of the Cities of the New World which will take place from May x to September 30, 1965, responds to a common interest in city life and city design which exists throughout the Americas. It is our belief that Washington, D.C., with its buildings, its parks, its monuments, its people, and its plans serves as a notable reflection both of our own historic experience in city building and of our aspirations in city life. This city provides as well a setting for the exhibition of the achievements and plans of our sister Republics.
The Organization of American States has offered its full cooperation, and I am asking the agencies of the Federal Government and the District of Columbia to offer their full support and participation. I invite the people of all countries in this hemisphere to share with the people of the United States in the celebration of this festival and in the exhibitions which we are confident will give form, content, and direction to urban life throughout the Americas.
