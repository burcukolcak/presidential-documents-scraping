John F. Kennedy
October 13, 1962

Remarks Upon Arrival at Standiford Airport, Louisville, Kentucky.
Lieutenant Governor--and I hope United States Senator--Wilson Wyatt; your present distinguished Congressman and an old colleague and friend of mine, Congressman Burke; Governor; ladies and gentlemen:
I want to express my thanks to all of you for coming to this airport. I want you to know that we're coming here to this city and State to elect Democrats to the United States Senate, and Congressmen, and I don't think that any State could be served with more distinction than by electing Wilson Wyatt to the United States Senate.
This State already has one outstanding Republican Senator, John Cooper, and I believe that he and Wilson Wyatt can speak for Kentucky as it needs to be spoken for, so I hope you'll elect him, and Congressman Burke.
The 87th Congress just adjourned today, and I believe that the record that he and his colleagues made deserves to be endorsed by the people of this city, as I know it will be. So I come here without being a candidate because I want you to send us Members to the House and Senate who'll speak for the United States and Kentucky and say "yes" in 1962.

Thank you.
Note: In his opening words the President referred to Lieutenant Governor Wilson W. Wyatt, Democratic candidate for U.S. Senator; U.S. Representative Frank W. Burke; and Governor Bert T. Combs, all of Kentucky.
