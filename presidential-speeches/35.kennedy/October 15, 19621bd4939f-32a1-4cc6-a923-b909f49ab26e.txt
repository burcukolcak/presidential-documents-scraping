Message to the Director of NASA Commending Commander Schirra and the Mercury Team.
[ Released October 15, 1962. Dated October 9, 1962 ]
ON the occasion when you are honoring Commander Walter Schirra for his exceptional achievement I would like to add my personal congratulations. The entire Mercury team is to be commended for its dedicated efforts to develop United States capabilities in space--to get our space program moving, from a position of second best to one of world leadership. That we are climbing back up the ladder is apparent in the matchless performance of our most recent flight I am convinced that although we are still second in hardware, we bow to no one in the quality of our space team--that their devoted and determined efforts will in this decade restore our leadership.
I am particularly proud of Commander Schirra for the great professional skill and personal courage he demonstrated in his magnificent flight. Would you please convey to him my warmest congratulations and the thanks of our Nation that men such as he devote their lives to its service.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[Honorable James Webb, Director, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, D.C.]
