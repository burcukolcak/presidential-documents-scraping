Message Marking the Observance of International Credit Union Day.
To Credit Union Members Everywhere:
You and millions of your fellow Americans have been showing for years your recognition of the importance of thrift by your participation in your credit union. You and many others understand the role of credit unions in encouraging both regular saving and the wise use of credit.
More recently, credit unions have undertaken new and valuable work in spreading overseas their encouragement of thrift. In newly developing countries, and particularly in Latin America, the Credit Union National Association and its World Extension Department are helping spread knowledge of this valuable instrument of economic democracy.
Credit unions are now operating in more than fifty countries of the free world, and in addition to helping their members economically are also furnishing an example of democratic control through their principle that each member has one vote, regardless of the size of his share in or his debt to his credit union.
For these reasons, on this day, the fourteenth annual celebration of International Credit Union Day, I salute all the people in the United States and throughout the free world who are taking an active part in the credit union movement.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
