Remarks to an International Group Attending the Inter-American Archival Seminar.
Ladies and gentlemen:
I want to express our great pleasure and satisfaction at having all of you here.
In the Archives Building here in Washington you have probably seen the phrase "What is past is prologue," and your ability to guard and make possible the interpretation of the past I think will insure a stronger future.
I am hopeful that the meeting here will improve the techniques which we all have for preserving the record of the past, but that it will do more than that, that it will make it more possible for you and for us to make meaningful this past to our present citizens.
There's no sense in having the papers of the past beautifully kept unless they have an impact on the lives of our people. I have, for example, always felt that one of the great lacks among Americans of this country, in their knowledge of the past, has been their knowledge of the whole Spanish influence and exploration and development in the 16th

century in the Southwest United States, which is a tremendous story.
Unfortunately, too many Americans think that America was discovered in 1620 when the Pilgrims came to my own State, and they forget the tremendous adventure of the 16th century and the early 17th century in the Southern and Southwest United States. But what is true here is true in your own country.
The Doctor was telling me that in Mexico you keep some of the records of Cortez in his country, and I am sure that stretching through all your countries are the most extraordinary records of courage and fortitude and perseverance--and I am hopeful that we can get all that into the light of day.
Note: The President spoke in the Rose Garden at the White House. In his closing remarks he referred to Dr. Jorge Ignacio Rubio Mane, Director of the National Archives of Mexico, who spoke on behalf of the visiting group.
