Statement by the President on the Discovery of the Omega Particle.
I HAVE just been advised of the discovery, by the University of California's Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, of a new elementary particle of matter which gives important insight into the structure and behavior of the atomic nucleus. I wish to commend the responsible researchers, Drs. Luis W. Alvarez, B.C. Maglic, Arthur H. Rosenfeld, and M. L. Stevenson, for this important contribution to the advancement of scientific knowledge. This discovery, I am told, is but one of a series of important scientific contributions in this field by scientists at the University of California, starting with Professor Lawrence's development of the cyclotron.
I understand that one of the responsible researchers, Dr. B.C. Maglic, is a visiting scientist from Yugoslavia. We are indebted to him and his other colleagues at Berkeley for their important scientific contribution and pleased that he could participate in these researches at one of our great universities.
