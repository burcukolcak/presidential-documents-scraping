Statement by the President Upon Signing the Foreign Assistance Act.
WITH THE SIGNING into law of this bill, a Decade of Development begins. The long-term commitment of development funds, which the bill authorizes, will assist the under-developed countries of the world to take the critical steps essential to economic and social progress.
The bill also continues our support of world-wide collective security arrangements essential to free world defense.
I am hopeful that the Congress will provide the funds necessary to fulfill the commitments it undertook in enacting this legislation.
Our adversaries are intensifying their efforts in the entire under-developed world. Those who oppose their advance look to us and I believe, at this dangerous moment, we must respond.
It is my belief that in the administration of these funds we should give great attention and consideration to those nations who have our view of the world crisis.
Note: The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is Public Law 87-195 (75 Stat. 424).
