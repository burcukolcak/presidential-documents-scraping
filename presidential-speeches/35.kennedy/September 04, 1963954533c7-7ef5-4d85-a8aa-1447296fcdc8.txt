Statement by the President on the Death of Robert Schuman.
ROBERT SCHUMAN combined vision with realism. He was a friend of free men everywhere. His proposal for a European Coal and Steel Community marked the beginning of progress toward European unity. Robert Schuman was a citizen of France, Europe, and the world whose passing I mark with great regret.
