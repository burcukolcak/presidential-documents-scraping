Telegram to Labor and Management Leaders Urging a Just Settlement in the General Motors Negotiations.
I WISH to emphasize to you, the parties participating in the automobile negotiations, the high degree of responsibility you bear to the country to achieve a settlement before the deadline. While the hour is late, I am confident that you can, by exercising industrial statesmanship, achieve a settlement which is fair and reasonable to both shareholders and workers and which preserves. price stability in the industry.
I urge that in the hours that remain before the deadline, you, the representatives of the General Motors Corporation and the UAW make an all out effort to achieve a just settlement. Our country at this juncture in our affairs can ill afford a shutdown in this important segment of our economy.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
