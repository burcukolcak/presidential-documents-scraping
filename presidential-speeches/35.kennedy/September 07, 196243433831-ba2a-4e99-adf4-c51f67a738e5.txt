Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill To Increase Veterans' Disability Compensation.
I HAVE TODAY approved H.R. 10743. It will provide the first increase in compensation rates to veterans for service-connected disability since 1957.
The bill provides an average 9.4 percent increase in compensation for nearly 2 million veterans who have been disabled in the service of our Nation. It will offset the increases in the cost of living which have occurred since the last modification of compensation rates went into effect. Our first concern in a veterans' program is to provide adequate benefits for those who have been incapacitated or handicapped as a result of their service in our armed forces. I am gratified by this recognition of that policy.
I am happy to approve this legislation, which will benefit so many to whom we owe so much.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 10743 is Public Law 87-645 (76 Stat. 441).
