Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House Transmitting Bill Authorizing Mobilization of the Ready Reserve
Dear Mr.____________:
I transmit herewith a draft of a proposed bill to authorize the President to order units and members in the Ready Reserve to active duty for not more than twelve months, and for other purposes.
In my judgment this renewed authorization is necessary to permit prompt and effective responses, as necessary, to challenges which may be presented in any part of the free world, and I hope that the Congress will give its prompt support to this authorization, as it did, so effectively, a year ago.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
Note: This is the text of identical letters addressed to the Honorable Lyndon B. Johnson, President of the Senate, and to the Honorable John W. McCormack, Speaker of the House of Representatives.
The bill was approved by the President on October 3, 1962 (Public Law 87-736, 76 Stat. 710).
