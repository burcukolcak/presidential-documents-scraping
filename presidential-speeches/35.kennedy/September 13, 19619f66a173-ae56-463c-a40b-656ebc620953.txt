Remarks Upon Signing Bills To Combat Organized Crime and Racketeering.
IT IS a pleasure to sign these three important bills which we hope will aid the United States. Government and the people of this country in the fight against organized crime.
These pieces of legislation are the culmination, in these three areas, of years of effort by the Federal Government and by the Congress to place more effective tools in the hands of local, State, and national police.
And therefore it is a pleasure to sign them, and in the presence of the representative of the Justice Department, Mr. Hoover--and Members of the Congress of both parties who have given this legislation strong bipartisan support--most particularly Senator McClellan whose recent hearings indicate great need for this kind of legislation.
Note: As enacted the three bills, S. 1653, S. 1656, and S. 1757 are Public Laws 87-228 (75 Stat. 498), 87-216 (75 Stat. 491), and 87-218 (75 Stat. 492).
At the close of his remarks the President referred to J. Edgar Hoover, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and John L. McClelian, U.S. Senator from Arkansas and Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Government Operations.
