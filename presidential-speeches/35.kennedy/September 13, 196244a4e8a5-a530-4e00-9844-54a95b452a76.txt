Remarks Upon Signing Bill To Establish the Point Reyes National Seashore, California.
I AM highly gratified by the action of the Congress in enacting legislation authorizing the establishment of the Point Reyes National Seashore in the State of California.
This is the second bill enacted by the 87th Congress authorizing a national seashore, the first being the Cape Cod National Seashore.
The Point Reyes National Seashore will preserve and make available to a great number of people the outstanding scenic and recreational characteristics of the area. This area is readily accessible to millions of our citizens, and its establishment as a National Seashore will pay vast dividends in the years to come.
The enactment of this legislation indicates an increased awareness of the importance of prompt action--and I emphasize that particularly with the population increases and these areas disappearing under that pressure--and the necessity for prompt action to preserve our Nation's great natural beauty areas to insure their existence and enjoyment by the public in the decades and centuries to come. This is especially true about those areas close to the major centers of population.
We have a great many beautiful areas in this country but a good many of them are far away from the centers of population. Therefore programs such as this one and the Cape Cod National Seashore are great additions to the lives of a good many of our fellow citizens. This goal has been well laid out this year by the Outdoor Recreation and Resources Review Commission, and I hope we can stay at it.
I congratulate the members of both parties who participated in enacting this very advantageous piece of national legislation.
Note: The President spoke in his office at the White House.
As enacted, the bill (S. 476) is Public Law 87-657 (76 Stat. 538).
