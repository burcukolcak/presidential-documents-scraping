Statement by the President on the Passage by the House of Representatives of a Bill Providing for the Hanford Reactor.
I WAS most pleased by the passage tonight by the House of the Hanford Reactor Bill.
This legislation is a major forward step in the use of nuclear power and will be of benefit throughout the Northwest to all power users both private and public.

This bill will eliminate the waste of millions of steam pounds per hour at no extra cost to the American taxpayer. The House is to be commended for taking this most affirmative action in this vital field.
Note: The statement was released at Newport, R.I.
For the President's remarks upon signing the bill, see Item 408.
