Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Extending the Federal Airport Act.
I AM HAPPY to approve this extension of the Federal Airport Act. This program is vital to our economy, our defense, and the growth and safety of our aviation industry.
I am particularly gratified by the action of Congress in providing the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency with the funds necessary to execute grant agreements over a three-year period. Such long-term assurance is essential if the States and local communities are to plan their airport programs effectively.
The bill also includes many new safety provisions. Airport landing aids will now be required in airport projects; and there is a special fund to develop airports to serve private flying and thus relieve congestion at busy airports serving commercial airlines.
Ever-increasing safety of transportation must be a continuing goal. I have directed the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency to establish priorities among projects based on safety considerations and to develop a classification system for civil airports based on suitability for safe use by various kinds of traffic as a part of the national system.
Note: The bill extending the Federal Airport Act is Public Law 87-255 (75 Stat. 255).
