Remarks Upon Signing Bill To Establish the Delaware River and Bay Authority.
I AM pleased to sign the House Joint Resolution 783 which approves the compact between the States of Delaware and New Jersey, establishing the Delaware River and Bay Authority for the development of the area bordering on the Delaware River and Bay.
The Compact will provide a foundation upon which the two States together can provide for the orderly development of an area which is of concern to both. Such coo operation demonstrates again the vitality of our Federal system of government.
I understand that the first project to be considered by the Authority will be the construction of a second bridge at the head of Delaware Bay, and the establishment of a ferry at the mouth of the Bay. These crossings will provide great benefit to the people of the two States. In addition they will benefit many residents of other States by expanding the vital connecting links in the routes of highway travel and transportation along the eastern seaboard.
I congratulate the States of Delaware and New Jersey and all of their officials and citizens who were instrumental in the establishment of the Compact approved by this Resolution today, and the Members of Congress from those States who worked for its successful passage.
Note: As enacted, H.J. Res. 783 is Public Law 87-678 (76 Stat. 560).
