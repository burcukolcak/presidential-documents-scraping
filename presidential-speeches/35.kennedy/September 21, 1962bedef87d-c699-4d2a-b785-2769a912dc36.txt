Remarks Recorded for an Oklahoma City Gathering in Honor of Representative Carl Albert.
IT'S a great pleasure to join with the many friends of Congressman Carl Albert in saluting him this evening. I know of no member of the Congress who has labored with more diligence and more effectiveness for the people of his own district and for the people of the United States. I have been, as President, the beneficiary of his wise counsel and his unceasing efforts to advance the interests of our country. He is a loyal and distinguished American. He has grown up in the tradition of Speaker Sam Rayburn. His recognition by his fellow members in electing him as the Majority Leader is only one indication of his strong character which will raise him to greater heights in the years to come.
I know the people of his district, who have returned him again and again to the Congress, know his qualities and I'm sure that they must be gratified that these same qualities which come out of the good earth of Oklahoma and the people of Oklahoma are being recognized by the people of the United States.
I salute Congressman Albert as a friend, as a great Democrat, but above all a great American.
Note: The President's remarks were recorded at the White House for broadcast to the "Salute to Carl Albert" gathering held at the Municipal Auditorium in Oklahoma City, Okla.
