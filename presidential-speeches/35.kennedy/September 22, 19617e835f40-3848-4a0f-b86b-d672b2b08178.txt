Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Relating to the Office of Emergency Planning.
I HAVE TODAY approved H.R. 8406, a bill "To Change the Name of the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization to Office of Emergency Planning."
Effective August 1, I assigned to the Secretary of Defense major Federal responsibilities for civil defense. The remaining responsibilities can more accurately be described as emergency planning functions, for they deal with responsibilities for investigation, advice, coordination, and policy formulation in connection with our preparedness effort.
These functions of the Office of Emergency Planning may be of critical importance to our very survival. The national security requires that there be soundly conceived and well-tested plans for every emergency.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 8406 is Public Law 87-296 (75 Stat. 630). See also Item 295.
