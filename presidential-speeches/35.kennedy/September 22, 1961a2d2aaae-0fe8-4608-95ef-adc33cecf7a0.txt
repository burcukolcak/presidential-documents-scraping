Remarks Upon Signing the Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Offenses Control Act
I AM HAPPY to approve S. 279, Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Offenses Control Act of 1961.
The future of our country depends upon our younger people who will occupy positions of responsibility and leadership in the coming days. Yet for 11 years juvenile delinquency has been increasing. No city or State in our country has been immune. This is a matter of national concern and requires national action.
With this legislation the Federal Government becomes an active partner with States and local communities to prevent and control the spread of delinquency. Though initiative and primary responsibility for coping with delinquency reside with families and local communities, the Federal Government can provide leadership, guidance and assistance.
The Secretary of HEW will administer the act. He will, however, work closely with the Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime, which I have appointed to bring about a more effective coordination of Federal resources in this field. This Committee includes the Attorney General as Chairman, and the Secretary of Labor, along with the Secretary of HEW.
The resources provided under 'this program will help local communities in their efforts to stem the tide of juvenile delinquency and youthful offenses, and thus contribute to the preservation of human resources in this vital area of the life of our Nation.
I want to express my appreciation to the Members of both parties of both Houses for their efforts in this area which are of concern to us all.
Note: As enacted, S. 279 is Public Law 87-274 (75 Stat. 572).
