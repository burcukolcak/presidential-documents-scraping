Letter to the Chairman, Railroad Retirement Board, on the Financial Condition of the Railroad Retirement and Unemployment Compensation Systems
Dear Mr. Chairman:
In my signing statement on S. 2395, the bill providing early retirement for railroad workers, I informed the Congress of my serious concern over the financial conditions of the railroad retirement and unemployment compensation systems. I know you, and the other members of the Board, share my concern in this matter, and I noted with satisfaction your recent statement to Chairman Harris during the hearings on this legislation that the Board would take up its responsibilities to keep the system financially sound,
I also indicated to the Congress my hope that we might soon have some recommendations designed to remedy the financial situation of these systems. Accordingly I would like you to undertake immediately a review of the situation and to develop recommendations which I can consider for presentation to the Congress.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[Honorable Howard W. Habermeyer, Chairman, Railroad Retirement Board, 44 Rush Street, Chicago II, Illinois]
Note: For the President's statement upon signing S. 2395, see Item 384.
In his letter the President referred to U.S. Representative Oren Harris from Arkansas, Chairman of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee.
