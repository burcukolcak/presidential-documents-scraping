Remarks Upon Signing a Resolution Providing for a Medal To Commemorate Sam Rayburn.
IT IS a great source of personal pleasure to sign this Joint Resolution in the presence of Members of the Congress from the State of Texas who served with Mr. Rayburn and knew him so intimately and are tied to him by the strongest lines of friendship. I join with them in authorizing the striking of the gold medal in recognition of the distinguished services of Sam Rayburn to the people of the United States.
Mr. Rayburn had an extremely high sense of public service from the time that he was in the Texas Legislature, where he was Speaker there as a young man; with his long service in the House of Representatives, where he had the universal respect and affection of Members on both sides of the aisle, and held the office of Speaker twice as long as any other person in our history; gave freely of his time and energy to all the Members of the Congress and to those occupants of the White House who served with him, whether they were Republicans or Democrats, and gave unfailing support.
I think his career has been a source of inspiration to all people in public life. In the State of Texas they love him, and I say I am glad to sign it in the presence of the Vice President, a long-time friend, Senator from Texas, Senator Yarborough, and Members of the Congress, all of whom have been in close association with him.
Note: The President spoke in his office at the White House at 12:15 p.m.
As enacted, the Joint Resolution (S.J. Res. 133) is Public Law 87-702 (76 Stat. 605).
