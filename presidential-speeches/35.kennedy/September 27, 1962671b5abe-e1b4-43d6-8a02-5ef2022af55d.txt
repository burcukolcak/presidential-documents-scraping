Message to Prime Minister Muhirwa on the Forthcoming Celebration of the Independence of Burundi.
[Released September 27, 1962. Dated September 6, 1962]
Excellency:
I was honored to receive your kind invitation to attend the ceremonies and festivities celebrating the independence of the Kingdom of Burundi.
I regret greatly that I cannot personally join with you in this celebration. However, I have asked Charles F. Darlington, United States Ambassador to Gabon, to represent me at the ceremonies and festivities that you plan to hold September 27-29, 1962, in Usumbura. Ambassador Darlington is a distinguished American diplomat and a man eminently qualified to represent me and the people of the United States on such an important occasion.
Once again, I extend to the Government and people of the Kingdom of Burundi my sincere congratulations and those of the Government and people of the United States on the attainment of your independence. We look forward to close and friendly relations between our two countries.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[His Excellency Andre Muhlrwa, Usumbura, Buruntil]
