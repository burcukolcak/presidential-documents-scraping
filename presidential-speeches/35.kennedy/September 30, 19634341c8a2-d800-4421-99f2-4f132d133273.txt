Remarks at the Swearing In of Postmaster General John A. Gronouski.
Mr. Postmaster, Mr. Justice:
Let's say the Postmaster has to take a much more binding oath than most of the rest of us. I suppose there is good reason for it.
We are very glad to have the new member of the Cabinet. His appointment has caused a good deal of interest--in fact, really more than anyone since Secretary Celebrezze--and we are glad to have you here, John. You have had a long career of public service in the State of Wisconsin, which has had a very high standard of public service for a great many years. And, therefore, you come not only recommended by all who work with you, and your friends, but also with the strong endorsement of a very distinguished State administrative organization. So we are glad to have you here, with your former Governor, Senator Gaylord Nelson, John Reynolds, the present Governor of Wisconsin.

We are sure that the mail will go on time.

Would you like to say something?
Note: The President spoke at 12:30 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House. Associate Justice Byron R. White, to whom the President referred in his opening words, administered the oath of office.
