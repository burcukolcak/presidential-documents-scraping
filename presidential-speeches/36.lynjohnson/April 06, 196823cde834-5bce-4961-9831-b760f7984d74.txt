Telegram to the Acting Governor of Illinois in Response to His Request for Federal Troops in Chicago.
IN RESPONSE to your official request made pursuant to your discussion with Mayor Daley that federal troops be sent to assist local and state police and the Illinois National Guardsmen under your command and on your representation that "under existing circumstances, the law enforcement resources of the state are unable to suppress the serious domestic violence in or near the city of Chicago, State of Illinois," I have directed the troops you requested to proceed to O'Hare Field and to Glenview Naval Air Station. They will be available on arrival for immediate deployment as required to support and assist police and the Illinois National Guard forces.
