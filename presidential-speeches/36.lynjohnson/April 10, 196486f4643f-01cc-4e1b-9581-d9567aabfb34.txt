Lyndon B. Johnson

Statement by the President: National Library Week.
LIBRARIES sustain and enhance our national life. They are a fundamental and vibrant resource for human intellectual and cultural development.
Libraries reveal great heritages of the past and provide doorways to individual attainments that can become great legacies for generations of the future. They are a fortress against intolerance and ignorance and an instrument by which the unfortunate poor may be helped to break their bonds of physical and spiritual poverty.
I am proud of our American libraries and happy that there are more and more of them.
I ask that National Library Week become a rallying point for cooperative, year-round efforts to provide the library services necessary to meet the diverse and changing needs of all the American people.
