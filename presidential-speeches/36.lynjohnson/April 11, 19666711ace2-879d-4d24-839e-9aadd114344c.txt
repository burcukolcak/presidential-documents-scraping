Statement by the President on the 1966 Youth Opportunity Campaign.
IN 1965, faced with the alarming prospect of hundreds of thousands of young Americans--16 through 21--looking for work in the summer and not finding it, this administration launched a Youth Opportunity Campaign.
In 1966, we are faced with that prospect again.
In 1966, 1,800,000 of our youth will look for work in the summer without finding it.
Some of these youngsters will be looking for temporary summer jobs. But getting those jobs may be the difference between being able to go back to school or not going back.
Almost a million of them will be trying to find their places in life, trying to become independent, self-sufficient.
If we fail them, it will mean that we are failing our future.

--It will mean that one out of every six white 16- through 21-year-olds looking for work won't find it.

--It will mean that one out of every five nonwhite youths looking for work will not find it.

--Finally, it will mean that we have allowed our youth who will represent 14.3 percent of our country's summer work force to become 50 percent of our summer unemployed.
Last month, I asked the Vice President to chair a task force on summer domestic programs. Their recommendations included one that there be a 1966 Youth Opportunity Campaign.

I accept that recommendation.
In 1965, a concerted effort, particularly by private employers large and small, produced a million jobs for our young people. Our country again proved its ability to respond to a serious situation.
In 1966, we can, in my judgment, increase by at least a million the work and training opportunities this summer for our boys and girls--in a way that is good for them and good business for all of us.

The private employer's role
I hope and believe that private employers who were largely responsible for our 1965 success, will exceed that success in 1966.

--There are 620,000 firms in this country which employ from 10 to 100 workers. I hope that at least half of these firms will agree to take on one extra summer trainee.

--There are 60, 000 larger plants, employing over 25 million people. If each of them will add 1 extra summer trainee for each 100 employees, this will mean another 250,000 trainees.
I hope other large organizations--labor unions, trade associations, churches, colleges--will make a similar effort. This could mean another 25,000 to 50,000 trainees.
So this program can get started immediately, I am asking that these things be done:

--That all private employers who are disposed to do so make their own arrangements immediately for taking on one or more extra trainees this summer.

--If advice of this action, including the name of the trainee, is given by mail to the Secretary of Commerce, Youth Opportunity Campaign Unit, Washington, D.C., it will be appropriately acknowledged.
--That all other private employers and organizations who are willing to cooperate in this program so advise the nearest State employment office.

--That all State employment offices be advised, through the U.S. Employment Service, to establish special Youth Opportunity registers for this special summer program.

--That all boys and girls 16 through 21 who want to work this summer and who don't have jobs get in touch immediately with the nearest employment service office. If this is difficult, write to the Department of Labor, Youth Opportunity Campaign Unit, Washington, D.C.

The Federal Government's role
I expect the Federal Government to do its share:
I am again directing the Government departments and agencies to make every effort to find meaningful work or training opportunities this summer for 1 extra trainee for every 100 employees on their present payrolls.

--This is to be done, for the most part, in the field offices and installations around the country.

--These opportunities will be given, so far as this is practicable, to boys and girls 16 through 21 who need them the most because of economic or educational disadvantages.
--There is a potential employment here of 25,000 trainees.

--Programs under the Vocational Education Act will be expanded from last year's 7,500 students to 26,000 students this summer.

--The work-study program, originally planned to provide opportunity for 76,000 students in over 1,400 communities, will be expanded to assist 100,000 more.

--I am asking that activity under the Manpower Development and Training Act be immediately intensified to provide training opportunities for at least 80,000 youths.

--I have directed a reallocation of Economic Opportunity Act funds to permit an extension of the Neighborhood Youth Corps program to an additional 25,000 boys and girls.
I ask again that the Governor of each of the 50 States, and the mayor of each city with a population of over 10,000, consider whether a trainee employment program like the one we are working out for the Federal Government will be possible and practicable. One percent of the number of their employees would be 30,000.

Task force appointment
I am asking the Vice President, as Chairman of the Youth Opportunity Task Force, to appoint an advisory committee to implement and work out the details of the program. This advisory committee will include representatives of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Small Business Administration, State and local governments, and business and labor organizations.
It must be clear that this program will be worthwhile only if it means extra work-training opportunities over and above those which would normally be offered. It would be worthless or worse if this program only replaced regular employment opportunities.
It must also be clear that we cannot and do not assure all boys and girls work this summer. We all will do the best we can.
A boy or girl who wants a chance to work and who is denied that chance costs this country more than it can afford. This is a special problem demanding special attention.
