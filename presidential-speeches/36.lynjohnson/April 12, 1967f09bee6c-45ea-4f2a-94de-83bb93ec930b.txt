Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Extending the "No Strike" Period in the Railroad Dispute.
IN ENACTING S.J. Res. 65, the Congress expressed the will of the American people-swiftly and decisively.
The immediate threat of a grim and paralyzing rail strike has been postponed. The railroads and the unions now have another 20 days to pursue their quest for a settlement through collective bargaining.
The urgency which prompted Congress to act should serve to notify both sides, as they return to the bargaining table, that the American people look to them for selfless and responsible action in the tradition of industrial democracy.
This resolution is a call upon their conscience. I am sure their concern for America will not allow that summons to go unheeded.
I am today appointing a special panel of three judicious Americans: Judge Charles Fahy, recently retired Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, George Taylor, professor of industry, University of Pennsylvania, and John Dunlop, professor of economics, Harvard University.
I have asked this panel to help the parties mediate their differences, and if the parties should fail to reach agreement, to recommend whatever additional action may be necessary.
I urge the parties to cooperate fully with this special panel in making collective bargaining a success in the extra time Congress has provided.
Note: As enacted, S.J. Res. 65 is Public Law 90-10 (81 Stat. 12). See also Items 170, 172, 188, 194, 207, 310, 311, 386.
The statement was released at Punta del Este, Uruguay.
