Statement by the President on the Death of General Melvin J. Maas.
NOT just the handicapped, but all the land grieves the passing of one of America's true heroes, Maj. Gen. Mel Maas.
Blinded in the service of his country a decade ago, he taught himself a new existence without sight, traveled the world over, and inspired people everywhere about the capacities and abilities of the handicapped. Arthritis crippled his limbs and massive heart attacks limited his mobility; yet his spirit was whole; his spirit was never disabled.
He has shown us how to live in the face of adversity. His courage and conviction have enriched us all. His spirit marches on, in us and in our land.
Note: At the time of his death General Maas was serving as Chairman of the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped, a position he had held since April 13, 1954.
