Statement by the President Announcing the Availability of the Neighborhood Youth Corps for Assistance in Disaster Areas.
I AM PLEASED to announce that the Secretary of Labor has just offered the assistance of the Neighborhood Youth Corps in States affected by floods and tornadoes to assist in flood control and reclamation work in public parks and on other community projects in which Federal disaster assistance is not available. Wherever Governors desire to do so, they may request special NYC programs.
The NYC of the U.S. Department of Labor will enter into agreements with State and local officials who wish to operate NYC disaster control and reclamation projects which would employ unemployed and needy youth from the ages of 16 through 21 on reclamation work.
In Minnesota the NYC's conservation project enrollees have been helping in flood control.
Through these emergency projects, disaster areas would be reclaimed more readily, financial help would be given to young people in need, and unemployed youth would have valuable experience in doing vital public work.
This action shows the ability of the war on poverty to meet the immediate and urgent needs of States and local communities.
Note: The statement was released at Austin, Tex.
