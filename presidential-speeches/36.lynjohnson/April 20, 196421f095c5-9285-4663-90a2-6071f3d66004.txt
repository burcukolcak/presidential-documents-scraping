Remarks on Introducing Secretary Rusk to the Press following His Return from the far East.
SECRETARY RUSK has just made a very interesting and informative report on his meeting with SEATO and with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and with Ambassador Lodge in Saigon. Secretary McNamara and Mr. Ball and Mr. Bundy and myself heard with great interest some recommendations the Secretary made together with his observations and conclusions in connection with the effort of South Viet-Nam. The Secretary will be glad to make a statement to you at this time.
Note: Secretary Rusk stated that it was quite apparent at the SEATO meeting that the members look upon the security of South Viet-Nam as utterly vital to the security of southeast Asia and view the latter in turn as vital to the free world.
The Secretary reported on his visit with Chiang Kai-shek and stated that the people of Taiwan had done a remarkable job in building a thriving economy and that they were now in a position to give technical assistance to other developing nations.
In South Viet-Nam Mr. Rusk found that there were a number of provinces in which pacification was moving ahead, and that where there was peace, good progress was being made on the economic and social development of the country. "It has some trained leadership of a very considerable capacity," he added. "General Khanh himself is an impressive man... He is on the right track and he is making good progress . . ."
Secretary Rusk concluded by stating that he came back encouraged from his trip without any misunderstanding about the difficulty of the job still ahead and without any lack of resolve about the necessity for getting on with it.
A question and answer period followed the statement. Both are printed in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 50, p. 695).
