Message to the 73d Continental Congress of the Daughters of the American Revolution.
I WANT to extend my warm greetings and those of Mrs. Johnson to the Daughters of the American Revolution on the occasion of your 73d Continental Congress.
All of us who are dedicated to freedom-the people of this and other nations; men as well as women--owe a great debt to those early revolutionaries and patriots through whose efforts the democratic principles of liberty and equality for all were set forth so vibrantly in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
It is with this belief that I challenge the members of the Daughters of the American Revolution to even greater service to your fellow Americans--to continuing your humanitarian efforts on behalf of underprivileged children--to helping win the war against poverty--to pursuing your constructive activities in the preservation of the historic landmarks and the sites of our revolutionary past.
For your future accomplishments and for the success of this meeting, I wish you Godspeed.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
Note: The President's message was read by Mrs. Robert V. H. Duncan, president general of the Daughters of the American Revolution, at the opening meeting of the congress.
