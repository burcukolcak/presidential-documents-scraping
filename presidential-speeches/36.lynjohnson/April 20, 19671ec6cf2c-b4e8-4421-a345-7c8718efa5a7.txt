Statement by the President Concerning a Report on the Teacher Corps.
DESPITE the many difficulties of its first year, the Corps has made a strong beginning. It offers bright promise for substantial improvement in the education of disadvantaged children, and it should be continued. This Council is convinced that to abandon or weaken the Teacher Corps would be a serious and wasteful error.
I hope this report will be read by every Member of Congress who is concerned about education in America. It confirms evidence we have received from every part of the country. The Teacher Corps meets a desperate need.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House press release announcing the receipt of the report. The release noted that the report was compiled by the National Advisory Council on the Education of Disadvantaged Children, established by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and was based on the Council's inspection of 16 sample school districts and 11 university centers for Teacher Corps training. The survey, the release added, was directed by Dr. O. Meredith Wilson, president of the University of Minnesota and chairman of the Council. Other members are listed in the release (3 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs., p. 648), which stated that the report (10 pp., processed) was transmitted simultaneously to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House.
