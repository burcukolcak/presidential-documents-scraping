Statement by the President following the Visit of Governor Connally of Texas
THE GOVERNOR is in town to testify before the Warren Commission—and he came by to see me and bring me the State's greetings on this occasion of San Jacinto Day, which celebrates the battle which gave Texas her independence as a free republic.
The reasons for the fighting have long since vanished before the warm and enduring friendship of Mexico and the United States.
Today, San Jacinto Day in Texas is an hour of jubilance in which Texans and our good neighbors to the south mark this new day of good feeling—and bring back memories of another time of high adventure when Texas was a sovereign republic.
I know there are some folks who insist that Texans still think the republic is still in existence—but the Governor tells me that Texas is definitely in the Union.
