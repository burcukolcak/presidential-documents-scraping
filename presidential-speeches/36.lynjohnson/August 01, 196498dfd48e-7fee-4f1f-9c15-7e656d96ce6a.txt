Statement by the President in Response to a Request for Mediation in the Shipping Industry Negotiations.
I HAVE been advised by Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz that both the New York Shipping Association and the International Longshoremen's Association, AFL-CIO, have jointly requested the appointment of a board of neutrals to assist them in their current contract negotiations. Secretary Wirtz has been instructed by me to respond to this joint and voluntary request of the parties.
Note: The current contracts in the maritime industry, negotiated after a long strike in 1962-3 (see 1962 volume, this series, Items 421, 428; 1963 volume, Item 18) would expire on September 30, 1964. On that date, voluntary attempts at mediation having failed, the President issued Executive Order 11181 (29 F.R. 13557; 3 CFR, 1964 Supp.) creating a board of inquiry under the Taft-Hartley Act.
