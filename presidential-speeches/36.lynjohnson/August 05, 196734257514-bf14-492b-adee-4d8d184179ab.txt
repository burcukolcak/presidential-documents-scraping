Remarks at the Swearing In of Warren Christopher as Deputy Attorney General of the United States.
Mr. Christopher and family, Justice Fortas, Mr. Attorney General, Senator Murphy:
The just enforcement of the laws in America depends on the integrity and intelligence of thousands of men in authority-out in the precinct stations, in the courts, in the correctional institutions, and in the Department of Justice.
For many years we have been quite blessed by the willingness of many good and brilliant men to serve the Department of Justice in positions of the highest responsibility. Warren Christopher, the new Deputy Attorney General of the United States, is such a man.
Since he was graduated with high honors from Stanford University Law School 18 years ago, Warren Christopher has engaged in a remarkable variety of tasks, all for the common good:

--as a member, or chairman, of the California Coordinating Council for Higher Education;

--as a member of the California Board of Education;

--as chairman of the American Bar's Committee on Aeronautical Law;

--as a board member of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law;
--as a member or chairman of several U.S. delegations to international textile negotiations; and

--as vice chairman of the Governor's Commission that investigated the Watts riot in Los Angeles.
Warren Christopher has entered the Department of Justice at a time when America needs the kind of thoughtful leadership that he has demonstrated in many fields. The Attorney General feels, and I believe, that we have in Warren Christopher a counselor of deep convictions and very sound judgment. We are quite proud this morning here in the Cabinet Room of the White House, in the presence of his family and his friends, to welcome him into our official family.
Note: The President spoke at 12:15 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House. In his opening words he referred to Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas who administered the oath of office, Attorney General Ramsey Clark, and Senator George Murphy of California.
