Remarks to the Press Reviewing a Cabinet Meeting on Economic and Fiscal Matters.
THIS MORNING we had a Cabinet meeting that began at 12 o'clock. We have had various presentations ranging from discussions on the domestic economy to international matters involving monetary policy, balance of trade, and a discussion by Secretary Fowler on fiscal developments.
I will ask each of these men to give you a very brief summary of the somewhat detailed statement they made to the Cabinet, for your edification. As I say, they ranged from economic policy, the situation in agriculture, balance of payments, the labor situation, the cost of living, exports, and other general matters.
It has been our policy to have Cabinet meetings where specific members have been asked to report on our conservation policy, our resource policy, Vietnam, or the Alliance for Progress, for example. This morning was devoted to the subjects I have discussed and each of these men can explain their review to you.
They will answer your questions. I will meet with Secretary Weaver and a group from his department in another room, so I will now turn this meeting over to Mr. Ackley.
Note: The President spoke at 1:30 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House. In his remarks he referred to Henry H. Fowler, Secretary of the Treasury, Robert C. Weaver, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Gardner Ackley, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Following the President's remarks Mr. Ackley, the Director of the Bureau of the Budget Charles L. Schultze, and members of the Cabinet addressed the group. Their remarks are printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 2, p. 1047).
