Statement by the President Upon Announcing the Appointment of the Members of the Consumer Advisory Council.
EVERY American citizen--rich or poor-is a consumer. And so, in a very special way, the public interest is the consumer interest-the interest of all of us.
In the past 3 years, we have seen the greatest advances in the Nation's history on behalf of the American consumer. At my recommendation, the 89th Congress enacted the first Traffic Safety Act in history. It passed the Tire Safety Act, and the first truth-inpackaging bill. In addition, it enacted legislation to protect our children against dangerous toys and to protect the modest savings of American wage earners in savings institutions.
Taken together, these laws touch the life of every American citizen, no matter what his income or his station in life.
Now, in the first session of the 90th Congress, I have recommended nine major laws to benefit consumers:

--the truth-lending bill --the Wholesome Meat Act --the Fire Safety Act

--the Hazardous Products Commission Act
--the Pipeline Safety Act

--the Electric Power Reliability Act

--the Flammable Fabrics Act

--the Land Sales Fraud Act

--the Mutual Fund Reform Act.
The Consumer Advisory Council will add new strength and direction to the great purposes which these laws support. The Council will recommend still further ways in which the Government of all the people can protect all the people.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House announcement which listed the members of the Council, appointed for 2-year terms, and stated that Betty Furness, Special Assistant to the President for Consumer Affairs, would serve as its Executive Secretary.
