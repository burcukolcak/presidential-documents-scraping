Statement by the President on the New Government of the District of Columbia.
WHEN the Congress was considering the plan to reorganize the Government of our Nation's Capital, I assured them that I would seek out the best qualified man I could find for the posts of District Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner. We have already begun that search in the District and throughout the country.
I also stated, and the reorganization plan approved by the Congress provides, that appointments to the City Council for the District of Columbia "shall be made with a view toward achieving a Council membership which will be broadly representative of the District of Columbia community." I wish to request all organizations and citizens of the District who are interested in the membership of the City Council to submit to me names of those individuals whom they consider qualified to sit on the Council and the reasons for their judgment.
It is important that we move promptly to install the new government for the District of Columbia. In order to allow adequate time for careful consideration, I am asking that these recommendations be submitted by Monday, August 21.
