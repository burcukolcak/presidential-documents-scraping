Statement by the President on the Volunteer Physicians for Vietnam Program of the American Medical Association.
THREE YEARS AGO South Vietnam welcomed the first American physician to volunteer for service in a Vietnamese civilian hospital. He was Dr. Richard E. Perry of St. Petersburg, Fla. This program was designed to relieve the suffering of civilians in a country suffering from a severe shortage of medical manpower.
Today, the 500th physician volunteer arrives in South Vietnam as a member of the American Medical Association's Volunteer Physicians for Vietnam program. Dr. Philip A. Pritel of Vancouver, Wash., is one of seven American doctors arriving today at Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Airport almost on the third anniversary of Dr. Perry's arrival in 1965.
Volunteer Physicians for Vietnam is a response to a plea from the South Vietnamese Government and people for medical aid. Supported by funds from the U.S.. Agency for International Development, it is administered by the American Medical Association.
Physician volunteers serve 2 months without pay in Vietnamese civilian hospitals. This is an example of true American ideals.

Physician volunteers have come from 49 States, the District of Columbia, the Canal Zone, and seven overseas posts. Fourteen women have served. Twenty-five doctors have served two tours, and five have served three times in this program. Twelve volunteers have returned to Vietnam as long term employees to support the U.S.. Medical Mission. Two former volunteers are preparing to return to Vietnam as medical missionaries.
Recruitment continues as the need in Vietnam continues; 32 physicians are needed every 60 days to maintain the program at its current strength.
The unselfish example demonstrated by these doctors makes us all proud of our American heritage of aiding the oppressed.
