Message to the Congress Transmitting Second Annual Report of Atlantic-Pacific Interoceanic Canal Study Commission.
To the Congress of the United States:
I hereby transmit the second annual report of the Atlantic-Pacific Interoceanic Canal Study Commission. The report covers the period July 1, 1965 to June 30, 1966.
The first report described the planning phase of the Commission's investigations. During the last 12 months the Commission has moved into the execution stage. The engineering surveys of possible sea-level canal routes in Panama have begun. A site survey agreement with Colombia is being negotiated. The route near the border of Nicaragua and Costa Rica is being mapped. With the beginning of the next dry season-January 1967--the surveying will move into full operation in Panama, and depending on the outcome of the current negotiations, also in Colombia. The Commission has also made substantial progress on the special studies covering the broad national and international implications of a sea-level canal.
After a year's work, the Commission has reached the conclusion that it will probably need more time and resources to complete its assignment than is contemplated in the present authorizing legislation. As soon as the Commission determines what its minimum additional requirements will be, I will recommend legislation to the Congress amending Public Law 88-609.
The sea-level canal investigations continue to be of great importance to the United States. The Commission is now well along with its commitment. I take great pleasure in receiving and forwarding the report of their progress to date.
