Presidential Unit Citation Awarded to Several Units of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.
BY VIRTUE of the authority vested in me as President of the United States and as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States I have today awarded
THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION (ARMY) FOR EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM
TO
HEADQUARTERS AND HEADQUARTERS COMPANY; 3D PLATOON, 5TH COMPANY;
AND 6TH COMPANY OF THE 2D BATTALION, 9TH REGIMENT,
5TH INFANTRY DIVISION ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM
The foregoing units distinguished themselves by extraordinary heroism during the defense of a Revolutionary Development Program pacification project near Tan Hung, Binh Long Province, Republic of Vietnam, on 11 July 1967 when they repulsed a full scale attack on their position by the 141st North Vietnamese Army Regiment. This numerically superior enemy force was equipped with numerous automatic weapons, large supplies of ammunition, and new equipment. During the early morning hours, the Republic of Vietnam units were subjected to a heavy volume of mortar fire followed by three separate human wave assaults against the position. In each case, the enemy penetrations of the perimeter were beaten back by fierce counterattacks. The viciousness of the close combat and the effectiveness of the defenders were fully demonstrated when more than 70 enemy bodies were found within the inner fortifications after the battle. Supported by air and artillery, the valiant defenders held their position, accounted for more than 170 North Vietnamese soldiers, and captured over 90 individual and crew served weapons. The determination, devotion to duty, and indomitable courage demonstrated by these men of the 2d Battalion, 9th Regiment, are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon themselves, their unit, and the Republic of Vietnam.
