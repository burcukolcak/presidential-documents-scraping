Telegram to Mrs. Philip Daniels on the Death of Her Son Jonathan, a Theological Student.
I GRIEVE with you in the death of your son. We labor towards the day when the cause of brotherhood may prevail, and the violence that sometimes scars the face of America may be ended. May God comfort you and strengthen you in this hour.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mrs. Philip Daniels, 67 Summer Keene Street, Keene, New Hampshire]
