Message on the Death of Henry J. Kaiser.
THE ENTIRE NATION joins with you in mourning the loss of a great American. Henry J. Kaiser embodied in his own career all that is best in our country's traditions.
His own energy, imagination, and determination gave him greatness--and he used that greatness unflaggingly for the betterment of his country and his fellow man.
May the memory of his long and creative lift--and the knowledge of his lasting achievements--help to console you and your family in this sad moment of loss.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mr. Edgar F. Kaiser, Honolulu, Hawaii]

Christian, Special Assistant to the President, stated that the President, in his naval service during World War II, had been close to and familiar with Mr. Kaiser's shipbuilding efforts, had always held him in great esteem, and had particularly admired his programs for the employees in his companies.
The text of the message was posted on the bulletin board in the Press Room at the White House on August 25. It was not made public in the form of a White House press release.
