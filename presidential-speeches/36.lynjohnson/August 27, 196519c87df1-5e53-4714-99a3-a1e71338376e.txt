Exchange of Messages With H. H. Cheeley of Iuka, Ill., on the President's Birthday.
MANY happy returns on your birthday. I am proud to share the day with you and am heartened by your warm expressions. I wish you the best in health and happiness until our next birthday.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mr. H. H. Cheeley, Iuka, Illinois]
Note: The text of Mr. Cheeley's letter follows: Mr. President, Dear Sir:
Your birthday is the same day as mine, on the 27th day of August. I am 102 years old. I am a Democrat and voted my first vote for Grover Cleveland on November 4, 1884. I have voted for every Democrat since then for 20 Presidents. For 80 years I voted at the same place in Iuka Township, Marion County, State of Illinois.
I back your way of doing business--less talk and more doing good.
Truly.
H. H. CHEELEY
