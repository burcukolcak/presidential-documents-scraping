Lyndon B. Johnson
August 27, 1965

Statement by the President Following Senate Committee Action on the Higher Education Bill.
I AM delighted at the bipartisan and overwhelming support that the House gave to the higher education bill yesterday. This brings us closer to the moment when every young man and woman in America can be assured of an education on the basis of his talent rather than on the basis of his ability to pay.
I am also very pleased at the swift action by Senator Morse and his Subcommittee on Higher Education in unanimously reporting the Senate bill this morning. Our colleges by 1970 must be prepared to add 50 percent more enrollment to their presently overcrowded facilities. This bill is a major step toward the meeting of the demands of the next decade.
Note: The statement was read by Bill D. Moyers, Special Assistant to the President, at his news conference at the White House at 11:50 a.m. on Friday, August 27, 1965. It was not made public in the form of a White House press release.
The Higher Education Act of 1965 was approved by the President on November 8, 1965 (see Item 603).
