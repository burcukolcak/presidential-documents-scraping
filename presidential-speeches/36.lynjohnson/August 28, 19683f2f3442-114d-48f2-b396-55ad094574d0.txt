Message to the Democratic National Convention Prior to the Nomination of a Presidential Candidate
On March 31, I informed the American people that I would not seek the nomination of my party for another term as President. That decision was and is irrevocable.
I ask therefore that my name not be considered by the Convention. I wish to express my deep appreciation to all those who might have wished me to continue.
During the remaining months of my term as President, and then for the rest of my life, I shall continue my efforts to reach and secure those enduring goals that have made America great--peace abroad and justice and opportunity at home.
Note: For the President's address to the Nation announcing that he would not seek reelection, seeItem 170.
The above message was read to delegates by the Convention Chairman, Representative Carl Albert of Oklahoma. It was not made public in the form of a release by the White House Press Office.
The next day, following the nomination of Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, White House Press Secretary George E. Christian issued the following statement:
The President called the Vice President in Chicago to congratulate him on the nomination. As the President said yesterday, all viewpoints have been expressed in the Convention. Now that the party has nominated an excellent and an especially well-qualified candidate for President, President Johnson hopes that all Democrats will unite behind him and move forward to victory in the election.
