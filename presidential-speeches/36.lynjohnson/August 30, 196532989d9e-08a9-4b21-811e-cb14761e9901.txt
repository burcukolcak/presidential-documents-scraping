Televised Statement by the President Announcing Postponement of a Shutdown in the Steel Industry
My fellow Americans:
I have been meeting with Mr. I. W. Abel, president of the United Steel Workers of America, and Mr. R. Conrad Cooper, the executive vice president of the United States Steel Corporation, Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz, and the Secretary of Commerce, the Honorable John Connor.
This morning I requested that there be no shutdown of operations and that production by the steel industry continue during the negotiations by the parties.
In response to my request, the union and company representatives have agreed to postpone the imminent shutdown for 8 days. During this period they will continue their negotiations in Washington. The next meeting will be held at 10 o'clock tonight.
I am confident that all Americans appreciate this response by the union and by the company representatives. Their decision has certainly been made in the public interest. I am sure that as they return to their negotiations this evening, they will be aware of the importance of their efforts to every man and woman in this country of ours, and to the health and the vitality of our economy and the security of America all around the world.
Gentlemen, this postponement will serve your country's national interest, and I am very proud of each of you for the contribution that you and your organizations have made. Thank you very much.
Note: The President read the statement at 9 p.m. in the White House Theater. See also Item 483.
