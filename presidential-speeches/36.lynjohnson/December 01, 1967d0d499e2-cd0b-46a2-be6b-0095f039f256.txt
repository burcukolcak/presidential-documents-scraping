Statement by the President on the Death of Dr. Alan T. Waterman.
THE American people mourn the passing of a foremost man of science and of human purpose, Dr. Alan T. Waterman.
Our Government has lost a trusted counselor. As Chief Scientist of the Office of Naval Research and as first Director of the National Science Foundation, he left an indelible stamp of achievement on one of the most vital areas of American life.
He will be missed. But succeeding generations will be wiser for his skill and richer for the foresight that marked his long career.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
