The foregoing units distinguished themselves by gallantry in action while engaged in military operations against a heavily armed enemy on the night of 19-20 March 1967 in the second battle of Ap Bau Bang, Republic of Vietnam. Although initially outnumbered more than ten to one and completely surrounded, Troop A tenaciously contained the fierce Viet Cong attack. As the enemy pressed its coordinated attack with mortars, automatic weapons, recoilless rifles and anti-tank rockets, the courageous defenders of the artillery fire support base at Ap Bau Bang sustained many direct hits on their combat vehicles, destroying two of the vehicles and wounding over half the troopers. With dauntless courage, ignoring their wounds, they struck back at the fanatical enemy, breaking up the enemy's repeated assaults. In violently executed moves, the besieged Troop A perimeter was reinforced by elements of Troop B, C and Headquarters, to relieve pressure on the defenders and destroy the Viet Cong forces. As the armored reinforcing columns raced to the battle area, they broke through the Viet Cong ambushes prepared for them, continued on to the embattled perimeter under intense fire, charged through the heavy enemy concentrations, and accomplished the first successful night reinforcement by armored units of a perimeter under heavy Viet Cong attack in the Vietnamese conflict. Massed fires of the cavalrymen and supporting artillery, armed helicopters, and tactical air fires poured into the enemy masses, as the troopers conducted successive counterattacks to complete the rout of the 273d Viet Cong Regiment. As dawn broke, after the six hour battle, enemy dead covered the battlefield. The indomitable fighting spirit and gallantry of the cavalry troopers achieved a signal victory at Ap Bau Bang which contributed significantly to the success of Operation Junction City in the Vietnamese campaign. The gallantry and heroism of the troopers was in keeping with the highest traditions of the cavalry and the United States Army.
