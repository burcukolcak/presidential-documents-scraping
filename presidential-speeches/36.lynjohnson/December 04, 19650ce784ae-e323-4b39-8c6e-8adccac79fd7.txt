Statement by the President on the Signing of the Charter of the Asian Development Bank
I was particularly pleased to learn that the Asian Development Bank Charter has now been signed, and I look forward to early ratification by the member countries, including the United States. My adviser for Asian development, Eugene Black, and Treasury Under Secretary Joseph Barr have informed me that they have signed the charter in Manila along with other nations--both Asian and non-Asian. The signing of the charter is a milestone in economic cooperation among the Asian countries and between them and countries outside the region. It gives great promise for the future for peaceful cooperation in a vital common effort-to help improve man's life in Asia.
Note: The Asian Development Bank Charter is printed in House Document 361 (89th Cong., 2d sess.).
