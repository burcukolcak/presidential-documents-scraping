Statement by the President Following Senate Approval of the Higher Education Facilities Bill.
THE SENATE is to be commended on its passage today of the conference report on higher education. This Congress is well on its way to doing more for education than any since the Land Grant College Act was passed 100 years ago. Members of the House and Senate Education Committees, Republicans and Democrats alike, are to be congratulated on this major step forward.
I extend my special congratulations to Senator Morse and Congresswoman Green, who have a long record of interest and leadership in this field of higher education.
Note: The President referred to Senator Wayne Morse and Representative Edith Green of Oregon, chairmen respectively of subcommittees of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare and the House Committee on Education and Labor.
This statement was read by the Press Secretary to the President, Pierre Salinger, at his news conference held at the White House at 5:40 p.m. on December 10, 1963.
For the President's remarks upon signing the bill, see Item 47.
