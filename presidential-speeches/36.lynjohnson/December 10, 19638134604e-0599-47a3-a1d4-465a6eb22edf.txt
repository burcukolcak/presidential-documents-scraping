Remarks Upon Accepting Eleanor Roosevelt Commemorative Stamps Issued by India, Ghana, and Korea.
MR. AMBASSADOR, I am very proud to receive these stamps that have been produced in honor of a very great lady. She was truly a person who cared. She belonged not only to the United States but to humanity throughout the world and this is a most thoughtful and generous act of yours to bring me these mementos which I shall treasure.
I want to thank you very much for coming here this afternoon.
Note: The President spoke at 5 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House. His opening words "Mr. Ambassador" referred to Adlai E.

Nehru of India, Ambassador Miguel Augustus Ribeiro of Ghana, and Minister Suk Heun Yun of Korea who, on behalf of their countries, presented the books of stamps to the President.
