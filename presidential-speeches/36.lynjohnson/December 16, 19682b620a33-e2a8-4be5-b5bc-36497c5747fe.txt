CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION

TO THE

460TH TACTICAL RECONNAISSANCE WING
The 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary gallantry in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force in Southeast Asia, from 18 February 1966 to 30 June 1967. During this period, the members of the 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing provided reconnaissance information to component commanders and higher headquarters on the strength, disposition, movement, and activity of friendly and hostile forces. Operating under extremely difficult and dangerous conditions, and against an enemy air defense system that was expanding and daily becoming more complex and deadly, aircrews of the 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing accomplished their arduous missions in an outstanding manner. Their exemplary performance made a major contribution to the United States Air Force tactical reconnaissance program in Southeast Asia. The extraordinary heroism and professionalism consistently displayed by the Wing's aircrews were matched by a similarly superb performance from the Wing's maintenance personnel. By their professionalism and untiring devotion to duty, personnel of the 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing upheld the highest standards of performance and traditions of the military service and reflected great credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.
