The President's Christmas Message to the Men and Women in the Armed Forces.
THIS is a season of hope and rejoicing as we celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace. It is a time for renewing ties of brotherhood with all men of good will, everywhere on earth.
Our thoughts are especially with the men and women in uniform. We ask that you may enjoy a full measure of this season's happiness. Far from your homes and loved ones, you make it possible for all the rest of us to enjoy more fully the meaning of Christmas. For your sacrifice we are forever indebted.

We grieve for those who have made the supreme sacrifice, for those who bear wounds for freedom's sake, and for their families.
We rededicate ourselves in this season of good will to the ultimate promise of peace made 2,000 years ago. To fulfill that hope remains our urgent quest.
