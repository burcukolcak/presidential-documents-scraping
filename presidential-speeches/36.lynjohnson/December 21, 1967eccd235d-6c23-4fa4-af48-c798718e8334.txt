Joint Statement Following Discussions in Canberra With Prime Minister McEwen of Australia.
THE PRESIDENT and the Prime Minister took the opportunity this morning, both in the Prime Minister's office and in a wider meeting in the Cabinet room, to exchange views on a range of current matters. As was made clear in advance, the meeting took the form of conversations about these matters rather than a formal conference.
Those present in the Cabinet room included the United States Ambassador (Mr. Clark), Mr. William Bundy, and Mr. Walt Rostow, and on the Australian side the Treasurer (Mr. McMahon), the Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Hasluck), the Minister for Defense (Mr. Fairhall), and the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gorton).
The principal topic touched on by the President and the Prime Minister and his colleagues was Vietnam. The President presented for the information of the Australian Ministers an account of the present military situation and political and economic development programme in Vietnam. The Prime Minister assured the President, as he had yesterday assured the Australian people, that there will be no change in Australia's commitment to stay steadfast with the Republic of Vietnam and the United States and with other Allies in Vietnam until a just peace is won.
Note: The joint statement was released at Canberra, Australia.
