Message to the Apollo 8 Astronauts at the Beginning of Their Flight to the Moon.
CONGRATULATIONS on the magnificent beginning of the Apollo 8 adventure. The visions of the past are coming closer and closer to becoming the amazing achievements of the present.
I am confident that the world's finest equipment will strive to match the courage of our astronauts. If it does that, a successful mission is assured. Prudence is a of courage, however, so we must give priority to astronaut safety as decisions are made each step of the way.
Note: The message was addressed to Col. Frank Borman, USAF, Capt. James A. Lovell, Jr., USN, and Maj. William A. Anders, USAF, the Apollo 8 astronauts, who were beginning the 6-day space flight which would take them into lunar orbit. See also Items 645, 647.
