Statement by the President on the Appointment of John E. Home as Chairman, Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
THE SAVINGS and loan industry of the United States is one of the most rapidly growing institutions in our national economy. In selecting Mr. Horne, Chairman of the Home Loan Bank Board, the agency most directly concerned with the savings and loan industry, I am purposely placing the regulatory responsibility of this industry in the hands of an experienced public official. In his service with the Home Loan Bank Board during the past 18 months and during his 2 years' service as Administrator of the Small Business Administration, Mr. Horne has demonstrated his commitment to the public service and his concern for a strong and growing economy throughout the United States.
Note: Mr. Horne's appointment as Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board became effective on January 26, 1965.
The statement was released at Austin, Tex.
