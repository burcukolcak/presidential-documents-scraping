OF THE

1ST CAVALRY DIVISION (AIRMOBILE)
The foregoing assigned units of the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), United Sates Army, distinguished themselves by displaying extraordinary heroism in action against an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam during the period 2 October 1966 through 24 October 1966. During the period cited, the Squadron was given the mission of conducting a reconnaissance in a vast, heavily defended area extending from the South China Sea, west to the Kim Son River in the coastal plains region of central Vietnam. Elements of a North Vietnamese army division were believed to be located in this area. The Squadron conducted a series of classic cavalry operations, comparable with any recorded in the United States military history, with devastating effects on all Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army units engaged. By the unparalleled application of exceptional imagination, fearless courage, and unrelenting determination, the Squadron succeeded in locating the enemy units within the vast area. The Squadron conducted air and ground reconnaissance with its 88 organic armed helicopters, highly mobile organic rifle platoons and other attached non-organic infantry elements. Scouting over the area, the Squadron aggressively engaged every enemy force encountered, regardless of its size. On 2 October 1966, a rifle platoon on a reconnaissance mission engaged an estimated enemy battalion-size force and annihilated approximately onethird of the numerically superior force in the first few hours of contact. The Squadron developed a major portion of all targets successfully destroyed by the Division throughout the period. The aggressiveness, determination, enthusiasm, and exemplary courage under fire demonstrated by all members of the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry, reflect great credit on the organization and stand in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.
