Lyndon B. Johnson
December 29, 1964

Statement by the President on the Appointment of Lloyd N. Hand To Succeed Angler B. Duke as Chief of Protocol.
AMBASSADOR Duke's service as Chief of Protocol since 1961 has been outstanding. Mrs. Johnson and I, as well as all of official Washington, will very much miss Angier and his charming wife, Robin. In November 1963, Mr. Duke agreed to remain as Chief of Protocol for 1 year beyond his original plans. The country is fortunate that Mr. Duke's experience and ability will be utilized in the important assignment which will be announced soon.
Mr. Hand is an outstanding young lawyer and businessman who has worked closely with Mr. Duke on occasions during the past year. I look forward to this opportunity to work again with a trusted and respected friend and associate.
Note: Mr. Hand's appointment as Chief of Protocol became effective on January 21, 1965.
On January 27, 1965, the President announced his intention to nominate Mr. Duke as United States Ambassador to Spain. Mr. Duke's nomination was confirmed by the Senate on March 9, 1965.
