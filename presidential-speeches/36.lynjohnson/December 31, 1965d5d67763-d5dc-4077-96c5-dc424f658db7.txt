Statement by the President on the Price Increase by the Bethlehem Steel Company.
THE Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers has informed me that the Bethlehem Steel Company's response to his statement earlier today contains no information on the price increase that was not in its original press release and no justification for the action. This is a critical hour in our history and it is highly important for responsible representatives of this one steel company to meet with the President's Council of Economic Advisers right away. This is certainly no time for unwarranted price increases which can lead to inflation. It is the time to consider the larger national interest, to weigh the impact of unnecessary price action against the sacrifices of our men in Viet-Nam, and to act accordingly.
Note: The statement was released at Austin, Tex.
