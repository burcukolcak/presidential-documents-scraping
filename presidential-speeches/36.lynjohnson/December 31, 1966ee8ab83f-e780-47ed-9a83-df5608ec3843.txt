Statement by the President on the Death of Christian A. Herter.
IT IS with great personal sorrow that I learned that Christian Herter--a great American--died last night.
His life and career spanned a period which saw this Nation emerge from a century of isolation to take a place of leadership on the world scene. From the day in 1916 when he took up a post as attach√© in the American Embassy in Berlin, to the leadership of the Kennedy Round negotiations to expand and liberalize world trade--which he was exercising to the day of his death-he participated in the events of our time and shaped them.
He was with President Wilson at the Versailles Peace Conference in 1918-1919.
He was at the side of Herbert Hoover in his work in European relief in 1920-1921.
He then turned to journalism and teaching and to public service in Massachusetts. He lectured on international relations at Harvard. He rose to be speaker in the Massachusetts Legislature; and then for 10 years was a Member of Congress.
As a Member of Congress, he led the famous Herter Committee, whose report helped bring to life the Marshall plan. For 4 years, he was Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and then Under Secretary of State and Secretary of State.
Throughout his life he stood for an America that would assume its full responsibilities on the world scene in conformity with the highest values of our national tradition.
Christian Herter was a wise, gentle, and wholly dedicated patriot. He will be missed greatly by all of us; but his life and work will always be remembered as an important part of the half century which has transformed this Nation's place in the world community.
