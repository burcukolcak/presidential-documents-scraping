Lyndon B. Johnson
February 01, 1968

Statement by the President Following Passage of the Truth-in-Lending Bill by the House of Representatives.
IN PASSING the truth-in-lending bill, the House of Representatives today brought every American consumer another step closer to knowing the cost of the money he borrows. I urge the House and Senate to resolve their differences promptly and to give the American consumer a strong truth-in-lending bill. I hope this will be the first of many measures that will mark this Congress as the consumers' Congress.
Note: The truth-in-lending bill was approved on May 29, 1968, as the Consumer Credit Protection Act (see Item 280).
