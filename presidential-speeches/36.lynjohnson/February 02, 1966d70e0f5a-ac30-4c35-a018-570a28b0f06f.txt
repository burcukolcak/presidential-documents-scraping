Lyndon B. Johnson
February 02, 1966

Statement by the President on the Message on International Education and Health.
LAST YEAR Congress, by its acts, declared this Nation's number one task is to now improve the education and health of our people.
Today I call upon Congress to add a world dimension to this task. The International Education Act of 1966 marks our commitment to help others to rid themselves of the slavery of illiteracy and ignorance.
The International Health Act of 1966 pledges us to join in banishing the curse of disease.
I have bold yet prudent goals for all of us to meet: To create 1,000 school-to-school partnerships with the young of other nations; to bring 5,000 exchange Peace Corps volunteers from abroad to live and work in our country; to conquer or control some of the world's killer diseases--cholera, smallpox, malaria; to enrich diets of 150 million infants and mothers in less developed nations.
Half a century ago the philosopher William James declared that mankind must seek a moral equivalent of war. That search has become more desperate today than ever before. So we call on all rich nations and all poor nations, friend and foe alike, to join us in this combat. It can be the first work of the world for generations yet to come.
Note: The President also recorded the statement for radio and television broadcast.
