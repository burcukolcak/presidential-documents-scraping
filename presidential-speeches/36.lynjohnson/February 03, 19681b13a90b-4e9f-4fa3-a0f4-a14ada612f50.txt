Statement by the President Upon Appointing an Advisory Council To Evaluate Supplementary Educational Centers and Services.
THE COUNCIL will help us to broaden the benefits of this program which has helped to enrich the educational experiences of 17 million children during the past 2 years.
This program helps us to bring the latest and the best in teaching facilities and methods to our children.
[Grants to the States] provide State education agencies with major new responsibilities and opportunities to assume leadership in the improvement of American education.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House release announcing the formation of the National Advisory Council on Supplementary Centers and Services. The Council was established under authority of provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Amendments of 1967 (81 Stat. 797) to ascertain the effectiveness of special educational programs set up under Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (79 Stat. 39) and designed to supplement and strengthen elementary and secondary education. The release stated that the supplementary centers would provide facilities and resources which local school districts are unable to furnish, such as science laboratories for joint use by several schools, mobile remedial reading laboratories, visits by artists or lecturers to remote schools, and instruction in new methods of motivating and teaching handicapped children. The full text of the release, which lists the 11 members of the Council, is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 4, p. 213).
