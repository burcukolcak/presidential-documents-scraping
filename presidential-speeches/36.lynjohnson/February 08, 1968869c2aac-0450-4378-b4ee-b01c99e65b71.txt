Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of the National Endowment for the Arts.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit the Annual Report of the National Endowment for the Arts for Fiscal Year 1967--the first full year of its existence.
The report offers abundant proof that the Endowment has made good use of its resources. With the advice and recommendations of the members of the National Council on the Arts, the Endowment has:

--Opened new opportunities for creative writers, art students, and visual and performing artists;

--Created three Laboratory Theatres-in Los Angeles, New Orleans, and Providence--for the presentation of professional theatre to secondary school students and the adult community;

--Assisted 17 resident professional theatres across the Nation;
--Initiated the first American Literary Anthology, representing the finest work appearing in literary magazines;

--Helped major museums expand their audiences and provide more services to their communities;

--Launched a program to enhance the environment of American cities with outstanding works of sculpture in outdoor public places;

--Created a new program to aid American composers and symphony orchestras;
--Stimulated the production and nationwide distribution of programs on the arts for educational television;

--Rendered financial and technical assistance to agencies for the arts in 50 States, and District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico enabling them to implement 295 new or expanded arts projects.
Throughout Fiscal Year 1967, the National Endowment for the Arts worked closely with private foundations, organizations and individuals, seeking to increase appreciation and support of the arts in the United States.
Since the Endowment was created, Federal grants totaling $10.5 million have been made. These Federal grants have been supplemented by nearly $16 million in contributions from States and cities, and from private agencies and individuals--dramatic evidence of the widespread support which now exists for those whose talent and genius enrich the life of our country.
The National Endowment for the Arts has made great progress toward realizing the mandate given it by the Congress to improve the quality of American life.
I transmit with pride this report of the Endowment's first full year of activities and urge the Congress to act promptly to extend the authorization for the National Endowment for the Arts.
