Statement by the President Announcing Progress in the Longshoremen's Strike.
THE BOARD appointed by me has rendered a decision which I regard as wise, sound, and prudent, and nearly all of the major ports will reopen at 8 o'clock in the morning.
The recommendations have my full backing. To the extent that this procedure has resulted in reopening ports, it is a job well and superbly done and the Board is dissolved with my deep thanks.
The management representatives have accepted the recommendations of the panel. A problem remains in carrying out the recommendations with ILA locals in the West Gulf and Southern Atlantic ports. The Secretary of Labor will discuss with the union representatives a procedure to effectuate the wise conclusions of the panel and will report to me promptly.
Note: The Board of Inquiry, created to report on certain labor disputes affecting the maritime industry, was appointed by the President by Executive Order 11181 of September 30, 1964 (29 F.R. 13557; 3 CFR, 1964 Supp.).
For the President's appointment of the panel to meet with the parties in the maritime dispute and make recommendations for resolving their differences, see Item 58.
