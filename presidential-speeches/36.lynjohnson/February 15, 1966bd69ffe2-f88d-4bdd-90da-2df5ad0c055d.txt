Statement by the President on the Death of Representative Albert Thomas of Texas.
OF THE QUALITIES that made Albert Thomas a remarkable man, devotion to the people he served and loyalty to his friends stand higher than all. I knew him--and knew him well--for a long time. He loved Houston and the Congress of the United States. He worked hard. He served well. His death leaves a lonely place in the lives of those who knew him best.
Note: Mr. Thomas served as U.S. Representative from the eighth congressional district of Texas from January 3, 1937, until the time of his death.
