Statement by the President on the Message on Consumer Protection.
I HAVE today asked the Congress to enact a series of major proposals to protect our American consumer.
Nothing could be more vital to our system of free enterprise--for the consumer is every man, every, woman, every child in this Nation.
The American consumer enjoys the highest standard of living of any time in our history. But there is important, unfinished business needed to strengthen the efficiency and the fairness of our marketplace. We must act and I think we should act now to protect every American against unsafe products, against misleading information, against the deceitful practices of a few.
Our goal is to provide for the greatest good--for the greatest number. And we must never lose sight of that goal.
