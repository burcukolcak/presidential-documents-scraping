Letter Accepting Resignation of Alexander B. Trowbridge as Secretary of Commerce.
Dear Sandy:
I cannot say that your letter of resignation came as a surprise. My concern for your health and knowledge of the physical stress that further duty would impose had prepared me for your decision.
Still, on the evidence of your fine performance as Secretary of Commerce and my own feelings of pride and gratitude, I can only accept it with genuine reluctance and sympathy.
You took office at an uncertain time in the history of the Department. You leave it surer of purpose, richer in assets, and stronger in resolve to match challenge with achievement.
These are your achievements, and they will last. The imprint of your devoted and dynamic leadership goes deep beyond the day. It will endure to invigorate the vital and expanding partnership of business and government upon which our people increasingly depend both for economic prosperity and social progress.
We who have advanced with you will miss you. All of your colleagues and friends are heartened by your intention to remain active in America's best interests. Lady Bird and I ask God's blessing on that. We want you and Nancy to go on in good health and all happiness to new rewards.
You will always be accompanied by our affection and admiration.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable A. B. Trowbridge, Secretary of Commerce, Washington, D.C.]
