Memorandum on Brotherhood Week
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
It is my privilege again this year to serve as Honorary Chairman of Brotherhood Week.
We observe it during the week of George Washington's birthday, February 20-27, because his voice still stirs and guides us: "To bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance."
It is a week for remembrance: social and economic injustice remain the unfinished tasks of the Great Society, the personal and moral responsibility of every citizen.
It is a week for rededication: our traditional ideals of tolerance, compassion and respect for individual dignity can only survive as they are replenished by personal commitment.

It is a week for thankfulness and expectation: we can be grateful for blessings granted and victories won, as we resolve to extend them and expand them.
Americans of all races, creeds and walks of life must join hearts and hands to stay the poisons which threaten our nation's life. Starting with the family and community, we must together extend to every American those rights of freedom and opportunity that are the wellspring of America's strength.
I hope the men and women of each Department and Agency will, in their own way, pursue this vital purpose during Brotherhood Week--and throughout the year.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
