Statement by the President on the Death of Admiral of the Fleet Chester W. Nimitz.
ADMIRAL NIMITZ loved his country and the sea. His devotion to one inspired his mastery of the other, earning for his quiet courage and resolute leadership the undying gratitude of his countrymen and an enduring chapter in the annals of naval history.
Note: In addition to the statement, the President issued Executive Order 11271 (2 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs., p. 244; 31 F.R. 2991; 3 CFR, 1966 Comp., p. 104) which provided that as a mark of respect to the memory of Admiral Nimitz, the flag of the United States should be flown at half-staff on all Government buildings, grounds, and naval vessels until interment.
The text of the statement was posted on the bulletin board in the Press Room at the White House. It was not made public in the form of a White House press release.
