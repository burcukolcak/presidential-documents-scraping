Statement by the President Reporting Progress in the Job Development Program.
THE JOB Development Program is off to a good start.
The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Commerce have reported to me on the first 3 weeks of effort. This period of initiation has provided invaluable experience in marshalling the resources of 10 Federal agencies for job development in service and related industries. As sponsors, contractors, and program administrators, these departments can serve as catalysts for the development of jobs in the private economy.
I am pleased with the interest and receptivity shown by the business community to this program.
There is a vast potential throughout the economy for new jobs and careers in service occupations for many Americans now unemployed and underemployed.
The needs enumerated in my statement of February 1 remain valid.
Basic education and training will often be required to prepare workers for the service jobs that become available.
Information about existing and potential job opportunities remains inadequate.
I have directed the Secretaries who are carrying this program forward to move now from this excellent beginning and to proceed with plans to involve as many private and public organizations as is fitting. I have asked them to give particular attention to those programs and policies necessary to a longer range and more comprehensive program.
This special effort to stimulate job development in an expanding field can and will pay off.
Note: The report of Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz and Secretary of Commerce John T. Connor, in the form of a memorandum, was also released.
