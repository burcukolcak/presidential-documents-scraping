Statement by the President on the 50th Anniversary of the Smith-Hughes Vocational Education Act.
FIFTY YEARS ago today--February 23, 1917--President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the Smith-Hughes Vocational Education Act--an act which has provided a firm foundation for significant developments in public vocational and technical education in the United States.
One of the most important accomplishments of the Smith-Hughes Act was the establishment of cooperative activities between the Federal Government and the States. Financial support is provided to our country's most worthwhile endeavor, the education and development of its youth.
Congress has passed a number of other acts to provide for the expansion and further development of vocational and technical education. The Vocational Education Act of 1963 is helping to make possible an effective nationwide system of vocational and technical education programs. Over the 50-year period, approximately $1.7 billion has been made available to the States under Federal vocational education laws.
Our goal must be to develop high quality programs of vocational and technical education related to the changing needs of the economy and readily accessible to all youths and adults.
