Proclamation 3639â€”National Farm Safety Week, 1965

Hundreds of thousands of volunteer leaders and members of rural organizations are working actively in safety programs across the Nation. They are helping to reduce accidents among farm people. Still, accidents claim the lives of thousands of farm residents, and nearly 800,000 more are disabled each year. This tragic and needless waste of human and economic resources is detrimental to the well-being of the entire Nation. I therefore view farm safety as a matter of vital national concern.
I commend the public-spirited men and women responsible for rural safety programs in the past. Their efforts must continue to get public recognition and support. Now I urge vigorous new efforts to eradicate the hazards that cause farm and rural accidents, and to promote continued public awareness of safety practices. This should be the objective of National Farm Safety Week, 1965.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,President of the United States of America, do hereby call on the people of the Nation to observe the week beginning July 25, 1965, as National Farm Safety Week. I urge all farm families, and all people and organizations allied with agriculture, to engage in a united effort to reduce accidents at work, in homes, at recreation, and on our Nation's highways and roads.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 24th day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-ninth.
