Memorandum From the President to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies Urging Support of the 1966 Red Cross Month Campaign
The American Red Cross has earned the respect, affection and gratitude of the American people. It has gained our confidence and support through years of devoted service to our Armed Forces personnel and to the victims of thousands of disasters.
This year the Red Cross has acted swiftly to meet the special demands of Vietnam. It has mobilized and expanded its staffâ€”and it is doing a magnificent job for our troops on many fronts. Red Cross staffs are on duty around the clock to assist our servicemen and their families in Vietnam and here at home.
At the same time, Red Cross has repeatedly mobilized its resources to help families stricken by major disasters in every part of our nation. Hurricane Betsy's havoc was responsible for the highest Red Cross expenditure for a disaster operation since 1955. In addition to its aid to the Armed Forces and disaster victims, the Red Cross has continued to provide many other vital services to our nation and our communities.
These efforts on our behalf have critically reduced the financial resources of the organization. The Red Cross has earned and needs our help. The Campaign for Members and Funds is authorized each year within the Executive Departments and Agencies. It will be held in March 1966, except in those communities where the Red Cross raises its funds in partnership with United Way and combined campaigns.
As President of the United States and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross I strongly urge support of the Red Cross Campaign in 1966 by all civilian employees of the Federal Government and members of the Armed Forces.
