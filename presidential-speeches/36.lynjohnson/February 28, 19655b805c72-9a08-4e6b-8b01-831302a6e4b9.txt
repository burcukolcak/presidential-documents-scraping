Statement by the President on the Neighborhood Youth Corps.
AFTER ONLY 14 weeks of operation the Neighborhood Youth Corps now has more than 565 proposals from local communities to aid over 200,000 boys and girls.
More proposals are arriving daily.
The initial target of 150,000 enrollees will be reached in the initial stage of the Youth Corps program.
Fifteen new projects being announced by Secretary Wirtz today bring to 93 the total of Youth Corps projects that are operating or will soon be operating in 37 States, providing work experience and opportunity for over 65,000 enrollees.
This is truly an impressive beginning.
It has been the policy of this Government to maintain the maximum of efficiency in its operations so as to invest in the improvement of the lives of all of our citizens. The Youth Corps is an investment in hope and opportunity.
The American people have made the war against poverty their personal battle. This is additional evidence that our towns and cities intend to win that war.
Note: The statement was made public as part of a White House release which also included the text of a memorandum to the President from Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz, reporting on the Neighborhood Youth Corps.
Secretary Wirtz' announcement of the 15 new Neighborhood Youth Corps projects was released by the U.S. Department of Labor on the same day (USDL release--6523).
