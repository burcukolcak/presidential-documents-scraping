Statement by the President on the Death of Henry Luce
HENRY LUCE was a pioneer of American journalism.
He penetrated the surface of events to interpret their meaning, their causes and effects.
A man of perception himself, his insight into developments of the 20th century was reflected on the pages of his publications.
He had a sense of history in the making, and so helped millions of men and women in this country and abroad to understand the forces that shape the society in which they live.
He also possessed an intense concern for the spiritual and educational well-being of his fellow men. Born in China, he retained an active personal interest in the Far East-its people and its progress.
The magazines that bear his stamp are an authentic part of life in America. They are living memorials to a man of great courage, farsighted vision, and strong convictions. His enlightened judgments will live and grow despite his passing.
NOTE. Henry R. Luce was the founder and publisher of Time-Life, Inc.
