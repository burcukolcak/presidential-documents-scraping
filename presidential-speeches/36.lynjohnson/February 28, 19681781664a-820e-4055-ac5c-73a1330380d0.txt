Message to the Congress Transmitting Report on Federal Disaster Relief Activities in 1967.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting to the Congress the report of activities in 1967 under the Federal Disaster Relief Act.
During 1967, eleven "major disasters" were declared under the authority of P.L. 81-875. More than $25 million were allocated to meet these disasters.
Through quick and effective action at the Federal, State and local levels, countless lives were saved, public facilities restored, and property losses kept to a minimum.
The floods in Alaska in August caused an estimated $90 million in damage. Quick Federal, State and local action helped complete all priority restoration before the winter freeze set in.
When hurricane Beulah struck in Texas last September, Federal forces immediately joined in evacuation, rescue, and relief operations. As a result, death, injury and loss were kept to a minimum during one of the worst storms in our history.
In addition, four allocations--totalling more than $13 million--were authorized for disasters that took place in previous years. The process of rebuilding after an earthquake or a hurricane is long and hard, and our commitment to the people of a ravaged area must often extend over several years.
A perfect year for this program would consist of no expenditures--no disasters. Until that time comes, I am confident that we will continue to respond quickly to help State and local governments alleviate the suffering and repair the damage wrought by natural disasters.

I commend this report to your attention.
