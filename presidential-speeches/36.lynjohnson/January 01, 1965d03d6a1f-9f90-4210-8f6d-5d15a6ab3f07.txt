Message to the Finnish People on the Centennial of the Birth of Jean Sibelius.
WE IN AMERICA celebrate this year the centennial of the birth of Jean Sibelius, the great Finnish composer. His achievement has become a part of the world's cultural heritage. Through his art, Sibelius has made an enduring contribution to the enrichment of the human spirit, and his music continues to bring enjoyment to people throughout the world. For us, as for the people of Finland, his Finlandia has become a symbol of man's indomitable will for freedom. We are therefore proud to join in doing homage to this son of Finland during Sibelius year.
