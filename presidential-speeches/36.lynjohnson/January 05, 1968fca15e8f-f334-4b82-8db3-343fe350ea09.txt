Statement by the President on Federally Supported Vocational and Technical Education Programs.
HELPING a man or woman learn the skills needed to secure a good job is one of our important tasks.
The vocational training partnership between Federal, State, and local governments prepares skilled workers to become self-supporting, to contribute many times over to the wealth of our Nation.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House release summarizing recent data relating to federally supported vocational and technical education programs. The release stated that Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare John W. Gardner informed the President that 7.5 million Americans of all ages were presently being trained for skilled jobs through such programs. Of this number 3.7 million were in high school programs, 600,000 in post-secondary school programs, 200,000 in programs for school dropouts, and 3 million in adult education programs. The various programs would cost Federal, State, and local governments more than $1 billion per year. The text of the White House release is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 4, p. 35).
The statement was released at San Antonio, Texas.
