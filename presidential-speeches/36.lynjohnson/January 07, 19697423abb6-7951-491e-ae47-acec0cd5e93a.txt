The President's Remarks to Reporters Following His Meeting With the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare-Designate
MR. FINCH came in this morning. We spent an interesting and rather delightful hour talking about health and education in this country, and poverty and social security. He asked some questions, and I answered those that I could.
I have known him and known of him for a good many years. I am very hopeful that he will find his work interesting and exciting, and I believe he will.
I want to do anything I can in this year's budget and the years ahead to be helpful and constructive. This is a field that, as you know, is one in which this administration has made some progress, but we have so much further to go.
I feel very pleased about the indications he gives me of his interest in this field, and I have told him that if there is anything in the world that a retiring President is really interested in it is his health, his education, and his welfare.
Note: The President spoke to reporters at 12:50 p.m. in his office at the White House following his meeting with Lieutenant Governor Robert H. Finch of California, who had been designated by President-elect Nixon to be Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.
