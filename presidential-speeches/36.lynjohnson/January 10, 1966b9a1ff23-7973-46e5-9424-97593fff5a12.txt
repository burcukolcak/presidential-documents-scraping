Statement by the President on the Death of Prime Minister Shastri of India.
OUR NATION mourns the death of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri of India. As the leader of the world's largest democracy, he had already gained a special place in American hearts. His tragic loss, after fruitful discussions at Tashkent, is a grievous blow to the hopes of mankind for peace and progress.
Lal Bahadur Shastri, in only 19 months in office, proved a fitting successor to Pandit Nehru by holding aloft the highest ideals of Indian democracy. His modesty in high office did not conceal his strength and wisdom as the recognized leader of his people. The world is a smaller place without him, and our hearts go out to his family and to the people of India.
Note: The statement was read to members of the press by Bill D. Moyers, Special Assistant to the President, in his office at the White House at 5:45 p.m., on Monday, January 10, 1966. It was not made public in the form of a White House press release.
