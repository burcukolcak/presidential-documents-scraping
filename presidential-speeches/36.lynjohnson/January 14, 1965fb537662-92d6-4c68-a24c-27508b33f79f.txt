Lyndon B. Johnson
January 14, 1965

Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House on Highways in the Nation's Capital.
Dear Mr. President: (Dear Mr. Speaker:)
I transmit herewith a copy of a letter dated January 8, 1965 to me for transmittal to the Congress by the Administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency in accordance with the provisions of Section 204(b)(2) of the National Capital Transportation Act of 1960.
I know the Congress will be pleased, as I am, to note the consensus of the Highway Departments and the Administrator that, with the contemplated construction of the George Washington Memorial Parkway and a north central freeway, no additional highways need be constructed in this quadrant of the District for the foreseeable future.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
Note: This is the text of identical letters addressed to the Honorable Carl Hayden, President pro tempore of the Senate, and to the Honorable John W. McCormack, Speaker of the House of Representatives.
The text of the letter dated January 8 to the President from the Administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency, C. Darwin Stolzenbach, was also released. In his letter Mr. Stolzenbach referred to the proviso in section 204(b)(2) of the 1960 act (74 Stat. 537) prohibiting construction of freeways or parkways more than two lanes wide in portions of northwest Washington unless recommended by the National Capital Transportation Agency. The proposed north central freeway and Memorial Parkway, the letter informed the President, would run along a branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad or would border the Potomac River. The letter further stated that local and State authorities were creating the comprehensive planning process required by the act.
