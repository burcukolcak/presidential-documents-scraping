Letter Accepting Resignation of Theodore C. Sorensen as Special Counsel to the President.
[ Released January 15, 1964. Dated January 14, 1964 ]
Dear Ted:
Reluctantly and regretfully, I accept your resignation as Special Counsel.
I know your decision to leave was a hard one. So was mine to let you go. For while many men may appreciate the scope of your work, only one man--the President himself--can fully appreciate its impact on the Office itself.
In the past 3 years, I came to respect you greatly--as you served John F. Kennedy. In the past 7 weeks, I came to rely on you greatly--as you worked faithfully and brilliantly to make this Government succeed. Those "great and lasting decisions in human affairs," of which you once wrote, will be more difficult to make without you.
But I accept your decision, appreciative of the motivations which led to it. I know that as the Nation has been made stronger by your service, so will the memory of John F. Kennedy be made richer by your book.
When it is finished, I intend not to let you forget your promise to be available for future tasks.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
Note: Mr. Sorensen served as Special Counsel to the President from January 21, 1961, to February 29, 1964. His letter of resignation was released with the President's reply.
