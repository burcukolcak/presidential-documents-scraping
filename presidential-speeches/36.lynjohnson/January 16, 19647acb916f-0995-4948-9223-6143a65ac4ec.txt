Memorandum on the Observance of Brotherhood Week.
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
I have accepted the Honorary Chairmanship of Brotherhood Week for 1964.
Dedicated to the principle of "to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance," as expressed by our first President, Brotherhood Week is traditionally held during the week of George Washington's birthday. This year it will be February sixteenth through the twenty-third.
This is a time of deep appraisal for all Americans. In view of our recent national tragedy, no better time exists for the searching of our hearts and minds.
The Honorable Brooks Hays is on leave to serve as the National Brotherhood Week Chairman for 1964. He and the offices of the National Conference of Christians and Jews throughout the country will be glad to assist you and your employees in observing this important week of dedication.
I hope that in its own way, each Department and Agency throughout the country will find it possible during this week to commemorate and underscore the importance of implementing the principle of the Brotherhood of Man under the Fatherhood of God.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
