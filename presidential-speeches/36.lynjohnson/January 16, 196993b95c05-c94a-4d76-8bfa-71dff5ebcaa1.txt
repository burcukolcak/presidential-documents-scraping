Remarks Upon Presenting the Medal of Honor to a Member of Each of the Armed Services.
Members of Congress, Secretary Resor, Secretary Ignatius, Secretary Brown, distinguished Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of the families, ladies and gentlemen:

For the final time during my Presidency this house is graced with the company of the heroes who have scaled heights known only to a very few men in this land.
The courage of the bravest in war is a very rare and a very special quality. It knows no rank or station. Generals and privates have won the Medal of Honor. Riflemen and sailors, pilots and priests have all worn it on their breasts.
It has gone to every kind of man that our country has ever produced. They have come from the cities and the farms in every section of our land--from very humble homes and from families of great wealth.
I don't know what there is though in this Georgia water, but there is something very special about this ceremony. Two of the recipients today come from the same little town in the great State of Georgia. And it really made me sorry that my grandfather left Georgia, because I take such pride in the accomplishments of you gentlemen whose families had been friends before you even entered the service.
We have had workers and scholars, businessmen and professional soldiers. They have lived in different times and they have fought in different battles on different fields. They have demonstrated their bravery many, many times in different ways, but they have all shared one noble distinction: Each man heard the call of duty in an hour of hard challenge. And each man answered that call with a courage beyond demand.
So now the names of Jackson and Pless, and Lassen and Dix are added to this roster of the very brave and the record of their deeds, at the very summit of human testing, will forever now be part of the history of valor.
The words "above and beyond the call of duty" would never sound again in the world that we want and work for. Never again would war summon the best that men can give.
But when that day comes, there will always be a high place of honor for the men who have bought it; for all the good and gallant fighting men who took their duty as they found it, and they discharged it, always, with the courage of giants.
Such men are with us here today, and we--who owe them and their comrades so much--all stand tall in their presence.
I should say that the thing that has given me more strength, as well as more comfort and confidence, in the 5 years of the responsibility that I have carried, has been our men in uniform--from those distinguished, outstanding members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff down to the lowest sailor or airman, marine or Army. They have never disappointed me once, and they have preserved freedom for us many times with their own blood.

The Secretary will read the citation.

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, March 3, 1863, has awarded in the name of The Congress, the Medal of Honor to
LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOE M. JACKSON UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty:
Colonel Jackson distinguished himself as pilot of a C-123 aircraft in the Republic of Vietnam, on 12 May 1968. On that date, Colonel Jackson volunteered to attempt the rescue of a three-man USAF Combat Control Team from the Special Forces Camp at Kham Duc. Hostile forces had overrun the forward outpost and established gun positions on the airstrip. They were raking the camp with small arms, mortars, light and heavy automatic weapons, and recoilless rifle fire. The camp was engulfed in flames and ammunition dumps were continuously exploding and littering the runway with debris. In addition, eight aircraft had been destroyed by the intense enemy fire and one aircraft remained on the runway reducing its usable length to only 2200 feet. To further complicate the landing, the weather was deteriorating rapidly, thereby permitting only one airstrike prior to his landing. Although fully aware of the extreme danger and likely failure of such an attempt, Colonel Jackson elected to land his aircraft and attempt the rescue. Displaying superb airmanship and extraordinary heroism, he landed his aircraft near the point where the Combat Control Team was reported to be hiding. While on the ground, his aircraft was the target of intense hostile fire. A rocket landed in front of the nose of the aircraft but failed to explode. Once the Combat Control Team was aboard, Colonel Jackson succeeded in getting airborne despite the hostile fire directed across the runway in front of his aircraft. Colonel Jackson's conspicuous gallantry, his profound concern for his fellowmen, and his intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Air Force and reflect great credit upon himself and the armed forces of his country.

MAYOR STEPHEN W. PLESS UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS
for service as set forth in the following
CITATION:
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a helicopter gunship pilot attached to Marine Observation Squadron Six in action against enemy forces near Quang Ngai, Republic of Vietnam, on 19 August 1967. During an escort mission Major (then Captain) Pless monitored an emergency call that four American soldiers stranded on a nearby beach, were being overwhelmed by a large Viet Cong force. Major Pless flew to the scene and found 30 to 50 enemy soldiers in the open. Some of the enemy were bayoneting and beating the downed Americans. Major Pless displayed exceptional airmanship as he launched a devastating attack against the enemy force, killing or wounding many of the enemy and driving the remainder back into a tree line. His rocket and machine-gun attacks were made at such low levels that the aircraft flew through debris created by explosions from its rockets. Seeing one of the wounded soldiers gesture for assistance, he maneuvered his helicopter into a position between the wounded men and the enemy, providing a shield which permitted his crew to retrieve the wounded. During the rescue the enemy directed intense fire at the helicopter and rushed the aircraft again and again, closing to within a few feet before being beaten back. When the wounded men were aboard, Major Pless maneuvered the helicopter out to sea. Before it became safely airborne, the overloaded aircraft settled four times into the water. Displaying superb airmanship, he finally got the helicopter aloft. Major Pless' extraordinary heroism coupled with his outstanding flying skill prevented the annihilation of the tiny force. His courageous actions reflect great credit upon himself and uphold the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.

LIEUTENANT CLYDE E. LASSEN UNITED STATES NAVY
for service as set forth in the following
CITATION:
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty on 19 June 1968 as pilot and aircraft commander of a search and rescue helicopter, attached to Helicopter Support Squadron SEVEN, Detachment ONE HUNDRED FOUR, embarked in USS PREBLE (DLG-15), during operations against enemy forces in North Vietnam. Launched shortly after midnight to attempt the rescue of two downed aviators, Lieutenant (then Lieutenant, Junior Grade) Lassen skillfully piloted his aircraft over unknown and hostile terrain to a steep, tree-covered hill on which the survivors had been located. Although enemy fire was being directed at the helicopter, he initially landed in a clear area near the base of the hill, but, due to the dense undergrowth, the survivors could not reach the helicopter. With the aid of flare illumination, Lieutenant Lassen successfully accomplished a hover between two trees at the survivors' position. Illumination was abruptly lost as the last of the flares were expended, and the helicopter collided with a tree, commencing a sharp descent. Expertly righting his aircraft and maneuvering clear, Lieutenant Lassen remained in the area, determined to make another rescue attempt, and encouraged the downed aviators while awaiting resumption of flare illumination. After another unsuccessful, illuminated, rescue attempt, and with his fuel dangerously low and his aircraft significantly damaged, he launched again and commenced another approach in the face of the continuing enemy opposition. When flare illumination was again lost, Lieutenant Lassen, fully aware of the dangers in clearly revealing his position to the enemy, turned on his landing lights and completed the landing. On this attempt, the survivors were able to make their way to the helicopter. En route to the coast, Lieutenant Lassen encountered and successfully evaded additional hostile antiaircraft fire and, with fuel for only five minutes of flight remaining, landed safely aboard USS JOUETT (DLG-29). His courageous and daring actions, determination, and extraordinary airmanship in the face of great risk sustain and enhance the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, March 3, 1863, has awarded in the name of The Congress the Medal of Honor to
STAFF SERGEANT DREW D. DIX

UNITED STATES ARMY
for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty:
Staff Sergeant Drew D. Dix distinguished himself by exceptional heroism on 31 January and 1 February 1968 while serving as a unit advisor in Chau Phu, Chau Doc Province, Republic of Vietnam. Two heavily armed Viet Cong battalions attacked the Province capital city of Chau Phu on 31 January 1968, resulting in the complete breakdown and fragmentation of the defenses of the city. Sergeant Dix, with a patrol of Vietnamese soldiers, was recalled to assist in the defense of Chau Phu. Learning that a nurse was trapped in a house near the center of the city, Sergeant Dix organized a relief force, successfully rescued the nurse, and returned her to the safety of the Tactical Operations Center. Being informed of other trapped civilians within the city, Sergeant Dix voluntarily led another force to rescue eight civilian employees located in a building which was under heavy mortar and small arms fire. Sergeant Dix then returned to the center of the city. Upon approaching a building, he was subjected to intense automatic rifle and machine gun fire from an unknown number of Viet Cong. He personally assaulted the building, killing six Viet Cong, and rescuing two Filipinos. The following day Sergeant Dix, still on his own volition, assembled a 20 man force and though under intense enemy fire cleared the Viet Cong out of the hotel, theater, and other adjacent building within the city. During this portion of the attack, Army Republic of Vietnam soldiers, inspired by the heroism and success of Sergeant Dix, rallied and commenced firing upon the Viet Cong. Sergeant Dix captured 20 prisoners including a high ranking Viet Cong official. He then attacked enemy troops who had entered the residence of the Deputy Province Chief and was successful in rescuing the official's wife and children. Sergeant Dix's personal heroic actions resulted in 14 confirmed Viet Cong killed in action and possibly 25 more, the capture of 20 prisoners, 15 weapons, and the rescue of the 14 United States and Free World civilians. The heroism of Sergeant Dix was in the highest tradition and reflects great credit upon the United States Army.

I want, if I may, to meet the members of the families and the Members of Congress. The Joint Chiefs are here. We want to thank Lieutenant Lassen, fully aware of the dangers in clearly revealing his position to the enemy, turned on his landing lights and completed the landing.

[Following the reading of the citations, the president resumed speaking.]
I want, if I may, to meet the members of the families and the Members of Congress. The Joint Chiefs are here. We want to thank all of you for coming.
If I may, I would like to have a picture with Mr. Pless and Mr. Jackson. I doubt that many towns of under 15,000 population have produced two Medal of Honor winners in the same day.
I would like to keep this picture among my souvenirs because it happens that one of them is from the 123d where I have a loadmaster son-in-law, and the other one is in the Marine Corps, that we have represented out there, too. And I want to send the other one to Secretary Rusk, because he is from Georgia.
Long before daylight this morning, I got a call that we were proceeding to an agreement with substantive talks in the Paris negotiations, which would indicate that we are a step nearer peace.
If we are, and we pray we are, it will be because of men like your great commander, General Westmoreland, and men like you who offered your life to try to bring peace to the entire world.
Note: The President spoke at 1:07 p.m. in the East Room at the White House. In his opening words he referred to Stanley R. Resor, Secretary of the Army, Paul R. Ignatius, Secretary of the Navy, and Harold Brown, Secretary of the Air Force. During his remarks he referred to AIC. Patrick J. Nugent and Maj. Charles S. Robb, USMC, the President's sons-in-law, Dean Rusk, Secretary of State, and Gen. William C. Westmoreland, Army Chief of Staff, who formerly served as Commander, United States Military Assistance Command, Vietnam. The President also referred to Newnan, Ga., the small town where both Major Pless and Lieutenant Colonel Jackson were born.
