Statement by the President on Announcing 88 New Projects in the War on Poverty.
IN THE FIRST 101 days of this unique national war effort we have brought nearly 400 transfusions of new opportunity to disadvantaged Americans in every part of this land. We have made a major and significant beginning to throttle want and elevate hope. We have changed what some have called the Government's war on poverty to truly every American's war on poverty. From every State in the Nation men and women have come forward to help in this effort.
Note: The statement was part of a White House release listing 88 new war on poverty projects in 33 States and Puerto Rico at a cost of $101,960,782. The new projects ranged from the establishment of a $20 million summer job program for 50,000 high school students to the sending of 4 VISTA volunteers to live and work among the Gila River Indians in Arizona.
The release stated that local antipoverty units had been established or were being organized in 80 percent of all cities with populations of 50,000 or more. In addition, more than 100 rural areas, including Indian reservations, had formed or were forming war on poverty organizations. An estimated 5,000 prominent industrial, business, union, welfare, and civic leaders were serving without pay on the boards of these organizations. Interest and participation in various phases of the program was also coming from sports figures, television personalities, artists, writers, and teachers.
