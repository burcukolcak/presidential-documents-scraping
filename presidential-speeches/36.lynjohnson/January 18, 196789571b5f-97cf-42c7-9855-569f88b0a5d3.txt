Lyndon B. Johnson
January 18, 1967

Letter Accepting Resignation of John T. Connor as Secretary of Commerce.
Dear Jack:
It is never easy to part with a member of our official family or adequately to convey how much we will miss him.
The diversity of your experience and skills, your astute business sense, your managerial and organizational skills, and your economic judgments have contributed much to the successful operation of the Department of Commerce. Your leadership has been vital to our record economic progress.
You have given two full and selfless years to your country at a time of vast decision and change, and although I appreciate the personal decisions you must now embrace, I also want you to know that I am grateful for your willingness to remain available to serve your country when needed.
You and Mary have been a source of great strength to Lady Bird and me. I hope you and your family find the happiness and success that you so richly deserve.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable John T. Connor, Secretary of Commerce, Washington, D.C.]
