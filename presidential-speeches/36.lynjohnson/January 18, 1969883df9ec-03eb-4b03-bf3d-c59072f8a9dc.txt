Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit to the Congress this Third Annual Report of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
The Report describes the many ways in which the Endowment, though in operation for only three years, is helping scholars extend the knowledge and wisdom needed for human understanding, and helping teachers develop better ways of making the humanities meaningful to their students. The Report shows that in Fiscal Year 1968 the Endowment supported the Humanities with grants to individuals and institutions in 44 States and the District of Columbia.
I commend this Report to the Congress, with satisfaction that a real beginning has been made in increasing Americans' awareness of their priceless cultural heritage.
