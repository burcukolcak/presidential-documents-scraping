Lyndon B. Johnson
January 19, 1969

Text of the President's Prayer Read at Church Services Attended by the First Family.
WE COME before Thee with grateful hearts, thankful for the days that have been ours and for the works we have been permitted to do together.
In these hours now, our thoughts are not of ourselves but of our country. Thou has blessed America greatly; may we, in the conduct of her affairs, be always worthy in Thy sight--and in the sight of our fellow man.
Deliver us from the follies of power and pride. Show us the uses of our strengths that will make life better on this earth for all Thy children. In season and out, help us to hold to the purposes Thou has taught us, feeding the hungry, healing the sick, caring for the needy, trusting our young, training them up in the way they should go.
Lift our visions, Father, renew our faith in Thee, and in ourselves. Stir our spirits and disturb our consciences that we may seek not rest from our labors but right for neighbors. Blind our eyes to the colors of men's skins, close our hearts against hate and violence, and fill our souls with a love of justice and compassion.
May we, as a nation, deserve no enemies and be worthy of all our friends, striving without ceasing for a day when mankind shall not know war anymore.
Watch over this city and keep it from strife and sorrow.

Guard this Republic and guide us in its service.

These things we ask in Thy name. Amen.
Note: The original prayer, written by President Johnson, was read by the Reverend Dr. George R. Davis at the National City Christian Church in Washington on Sunday, January 19, 1969. It was not made public in the form of a White House press release.
