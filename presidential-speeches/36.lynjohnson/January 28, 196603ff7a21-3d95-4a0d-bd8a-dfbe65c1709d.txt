6.Whereas,in accordance with Section 351(c) (1) (A) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, I have determined that the termination, as herein proclaimed, of the increased rate of duty effected by Proclamation No. 3212 (now reflected, with modifications, in item 943.10 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States) is in the national interest:
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B.

In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-eighth day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.
