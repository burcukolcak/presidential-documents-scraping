Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House Transmitting Proposed Amendments to the fair Labor Standards Act
Dear Mr. :
I am transmitting herewith draft bills, together with the letter from the Secretary of Labor submitting these to me, amending the fair Labor Standards Act to (1) increase protection for over two million workers, and (2) increase employment by establishing a procedure for applying higher penalty rates for overtime in those industries where this action will increase employment without excessive increases in costs.
The American genius for accomplishment has carried us to new economic heights. During the past 3 years our economy has increased by $100 billion, the largest peacetime rise in our history. Two and one-half million additional jobs have been created during this period, so that, for the first time in our history, there are over 70 million people at work. The earnings of American workers have increased at a rate of 2.5 percent a year. Most of this represents a rise in our standard of living, for prices have remained relatively stable.
Yet even with the increased demand for workers which an expanding economy creates, we have failed to provide employment for all who seek it, and there are many workers who receive less than a decent minimum wage.
This legislation will be another major step toward our goal of eliminating labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of a minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency and general well-being. It will help additional numbers of Americans to share more fully in the abundance with which our Nation is blessed.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
