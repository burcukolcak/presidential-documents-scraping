Message to Jean Rey, President of the Commission of the European Communities, on the Occasion of the Completion of the European Customs Union
THE COMPLETION of your Customs Union today fulfills the dream of a decade. History will record this achievement as a landmark on the road to European unity.

The movement toward unity responds to a deep desire of the people of Europe. It enhances the partnership between America and Europe dedicated to the cause of world peace and prosperity.
