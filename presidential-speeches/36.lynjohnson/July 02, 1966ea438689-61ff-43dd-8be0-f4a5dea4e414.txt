Statement by the President Upon Establishing a Commission To Study the Draft and Other Systems of National Service.
AFTER THE STUDY has been completed, my advisers and I will weigh its recommendations very carefully in light of our military requirements and the impact on our young people and their families. We will then offer to the American people that course of action which we believe to be best designed to protect the Nation's freedom with the least and most equitable burden on our society.
Note: The President's statement accompanied the issuance of Executive Order 11289 "National Advisory Commission on Selective Service," dated July 2, 1966 (2 Weekly Comp. Pres. Does., p. 894; 31 F.R. 9265; 3 CFR, 1966 Comp., p. 131).
The order directed the Commission to "consider the past, present and prospective functioning of selective service and other systems of national service" in the light of such factors as (1) fairness to all citizens, (2) military manpower requirements, (3) the objective of minimizing uncertainty and interference with individual careers and education, (4) social, economic, and employment conditions and goals, and (5) budgetary and administrative considerations.
The Commission was also directed to make recommendations on such matters as (1) methods of classification and selection of registrants, (2) qualifications for military service, (3) grounds for deferment and for exemption, (4) procedures for appeal and protection of individual rights, and (5) organization and administration of the selective service system at the national, State and local levels.
The Executive order authorized the Commission to evaluate other proposals related to selective service "including proposals for national service." The Commission's final report was to be submitted on or about January 1, 1967â€¢ The report is entitled "In Pursuit of Equity: Who Serves When Not All Serve" (Government Printing Office, 1967, 219 pp.).
