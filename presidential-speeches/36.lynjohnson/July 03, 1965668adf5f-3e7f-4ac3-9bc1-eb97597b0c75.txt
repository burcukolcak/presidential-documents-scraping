Remarks at the Swearing In of Homer Thornberry as Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.
My friends:
This is a very happy occasion for Lady Bird and me and all the members of our family.
We are so pleased that we could be honored with the presence of Judge Brown this morning, Judge Spears, and Judge Jones, who is a longtime personal friend of Judge Thornberry and a former partner of his.
Homer and Eloise have been with us the last few days while they went through the necessary constitutional requirements getting confirmed, and we have enjoyed their presence so much.
I don't know of anyone that is missed more from Washington than this wonderful Thornberry family. But I know, too, that the people that they serve in this area of the United States are very happy that they could be here.
We hated to see him leave the legislative halls, but we are glad to see him preside in the temples of justice. Because we know that there is no more courageous person, no better and finer human being, and no man with a greater sense of justice and fairness and feeling of equality for all human beings, wherever they live, whatever their color, or whatever their religion, than Homer Thornberry.
So, it is a peculiar delight for us to come back here to the porch of our little home and ask the Thornberry family, and the Engles, and Thornberry children, to come here to see Homer administered the oath as Circuit Judge of the Fifth Judicial District, in the Fifth Circuit Court, in the presence of his neighbors here, and some of the best friends he has in the world.
I now want to present one of those best friends--Judge Herman Jones.
Note: The swearing-in ceremony was held at 11:01 a.m. on the front lawn of the LBJ Ranch at Johnson City, Tex. During his remarks the President referred to Judge John R. Brown of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Adrian Spears, Judge Herman Jones, and Mrs. Homer (Eloise Engle) Thornberry.
