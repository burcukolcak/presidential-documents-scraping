Statement by the President on Ordering Further Withdrawal of U.S. Forces From the Dominican Republic.
I HAVE been advised today by General Alvim, the Commander of the Inter-American Force, and Lieutenant General Palmer, the Deputy Commander of the Inter-American Force, that conditions in the Dominican Republic now permit further withdrawal of United States military personnel from the Inter-American Force. This recommendation has the concurrence of the special committee of the Organization of American States and Ambassador Bennett.
I am therefore ordering the withdrawal of two battalions of the 82d Airborne Division, totaling approximately 1,400 personnel.
Note: In his statement the President referred to General of the Army Hugo Panasco Alvim of Brazil, Commander of the OAS Inter-American Force in the Dominican Republic, Lt. Gen. Bruce Palmer, Jr., of the United States, Deputy Commander, and W. Tapley Bennett, U.S. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic.
The statement was released at Austin, Tex.
