Statement by the President on Announcing a Mission To Consider U.S. Cooperation in Establishing a Korean Institute for Industrial Technology and Applied Science.
THE TALENTS of trained Korean scientists and engineers are a rich resource for the country's development and progress. I believe it is important that efforts on their part to advance the level of technological achievement in Korea should receive encouragement and support. If the Institute contributes toward channeling Korea's talents effectively into accelerating the pace of Korean economic growth, it will serve as an inspiring example of what can be accomplished through international cooperation in science.
Note: The statement was made public as part of a White House release announcing that Dr. Donald F. Hornig, the President's science adviser, would leave for Korea on July 7 to explore possibilities for U.S. cooperation in establishing an Institute for Industrial Technology and Applied Science.
The release stated that Dr. Hornig would be accompanied by his wife, Dr. Lilli Hornig of Trinity College in Washington, D.C., and by three advisers: Dr. Albert I. Moseman, Director of Agricultural Sciences, the Rockefeller Foundation of New York City, Dr. James B. Fisk, President of Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, N.J., and Dr. B. D. Thomas, President of the Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, Ohio.
The Presidential mission planned to spend one week in Korea meeting with government officials, businessmen, industrialists, scientists, and educators.
The Institute was first proposed in the joint statement issued at the end of President Park's visit to Washington (see Item 257). See also Item 407.
The statement was released at Austin, Tex.
