Statement by the President: Independence Day, 1968.
THIS IS a day of celebration, a day to draw new strength from the proud past, a day to rejoice in the liberty and opportunity that is ours, as citizens of a great constitutional democracy.
For 192 years, the words "United States of America" have stood for man's hunger to be free:

--not just free in theory, but free in fact;

--not just free from tyranny and oppression, but free to achieve the highest destiny of which he is capable.
Yet there is much to be done before that measure of freedom is fully achieved for all of our people.
A child that is born into poverty, a man who is not able to care for his family by his own efforts, a young person blocked by discrimination against his race or religion or region from meaningful employment, cannot be said to be fully free.
The laws I have proposed to Congress in the field of gun control would not deprive any citizen of any freedom that is rightfully his. But they would go a long way toward restoring to our people the freedoms they are denied today:

--the freedom to operate stores, banks, and businesses without fear of armed holdups;

--the freedom to live in their homes and use the public streets without the danger of armed violence.
So on this Independence Day, this day when we celebrate our political freedom as a great nation, let us resolve to take those measures that will insure our individual freedom as American citizens. Let us free ourselves of fear, so that we may enjoy the blessings that God in His mercy has given us.
Thank you. I wish each of you a joyous-and a very safe--holiday.
