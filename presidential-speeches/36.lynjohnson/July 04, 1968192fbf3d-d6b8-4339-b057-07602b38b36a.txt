Statement by the President on the Disruption by Hecklers of a Speech by George Wallace in Minneapolis.
AMERICANS of every viewpoint must be deeply concerned over the intolerance which prevented presidential candidate George Wallace from speaking in Minneapolis last night. Freedom to speak, freedom to listen, the full and open right to communicate and reason together are essential to our system of government and our fulfillment as individuals. However ardently we may disagree with what a man says, we must stand with Voltaire in our defense of his right to say what he will. It is from our diversity, our tolerance of diversity, our reasoning together from the many different convictions we hold that the chief strength of our people derives. The conduct of a handful who interfere with the rights of others to speak is the antithesis of what we began 192 years ago today.
Every American should again resolve on this Fourth day of July, 1968 that he will hear every point of view, that he will test all against his experience and his reason, that he will afford to everyone--and see that others do--the right to express their point of view, that he will lend all his energies to decide for himself what is best for his country. Having done these things we must-within the framework of order under law and by the ballot through which American citizens direct their destiny--we must with tolerance and understanding, gently and humanely but clearly and firmly, steer the Nation on that course which will fulfill its promise. While truth is free for all to see, we need never fear any ideology or candidacy.
Note: George C. Wallace, former Governor of Alabama, was campaigning in Minnesota as a presidential candidate on the American Independent ticket.
The statement was released at San Antonio, Texas.
