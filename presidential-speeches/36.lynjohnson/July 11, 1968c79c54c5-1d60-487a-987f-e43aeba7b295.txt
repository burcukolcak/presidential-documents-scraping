Statement by the President Appealing for the Prevention of Mass Starvation in Nigeria.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE have watched with growing grief and horror the terrible loss of life and suffering in Nigeria.
The war in that bitterly divided nation is daily becoming more costly. Civilian inhabitants are threatened not just by violence but by starvation.
Normal supplies of food have been cut off by the fighting. With foods containing protein increasingly unavailable, the lives of children are particularly endangered.
The United States has cooperated with other governments and private organizations in efforts to provide needed food and medicine. We stand ready to support the International Committee of the Red Cross with additional funds, supplies, and equipment.
Relief efforts thus far have been frustrated by disputes on how to get supplies through the lines of fighting.
While we have no intention of interfering in Nigerian affairs, we do not believe innocent persons should be made the victims of political maneuvering.
Deaths caused by warfare are tragic enough. But mass starvation that can be prevented must be prevented.
I urgently appeal to all those bearing responsibility to allow supplies to get to the people who so desperately need them.
