Exchange of Messages With the Secretary General of the United Nations.
I AM deeply grateful for your message about Ambassador Stevenson. He was not only the Ambassador of the United States to the United Nations, but a wise and unwavering friend of the United Nations within the councils of the United States. Knowing how deeply he cared for the United Nations, I find it a comfort to know from you as Secretary General how highly he was esteemed by his friends and colleagues there. We shall miss him, but from his life and work we can take courage for the future.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[His Excellency U Thant, Secretary General of the United Nations, United Nations Headquarters, New York, N.Y.]

The White House
I was so shocked and grieved to hear of the sudden and tragic death of Ambassador Stevenson. As the Representative of the United States of America, he had earned the respect, admiration and affection of all his colleagues at the United Nations for his extraordinary human qualities. I know that you must feel a sense of personal loss on the death of such a distinguished American who was also a member of your official Cabinet. Your grief is shared by all of us at the United Nations.
U THANT,
Secretary General
