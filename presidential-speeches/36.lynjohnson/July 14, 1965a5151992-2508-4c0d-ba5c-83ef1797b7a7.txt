Memorandum on Cost Reduction by Federal Agencies.
Memorandum for the Cabinet and Heads of Agencies:
Maximum efficiency of Government has been a consuming interest throughout my career and particularly since I have been President.
Such efficiency is no better illustrated than in the attached Annual Cost Reduction Report of the Department of Defense and the pamphlet, "The Challenge of Change", which describes the Department's efforts to meet its responsibilities to employees and communities affected by Defense changes.
I would like you to take the inclosed report and brochure home with you and read it carefully. Not only will you find it an illustration of a successful cost reduction program, but you may find it a source of ideas which can be put to use in your own Department or Agency.
I should be happy to have any plans of this nature that you may have brought to my personal attention.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
Note: The two pamphlets, issued by the Department of Defense, are entitled "Department of Defense Cost Reduction Report" (July 12, 1965; Government Printing Office, 24 pp-), and "The Challenge of Change" (July 10, 1965; Department of Defense, 53 PP.).
