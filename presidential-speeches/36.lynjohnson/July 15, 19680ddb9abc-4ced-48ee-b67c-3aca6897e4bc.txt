Statement by the President on the Death of Representative Joe Pool of Texas.
I AM saddened over the untimely death of Representative Joe Pool. As a Member of Congress--and before that as a member of the Texas State Legislature--Joe Pool served with dedication and love of country. Mrs. Johnson and I extend our deepest sympathies to Mrs. Pool and her four sons in this hour of sorrow.
NOTE Representative Joe Richard Pool was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1952 and served three terms. He was elected to the 88th Congress as Congressman at Large and served from 1963 until his death.
