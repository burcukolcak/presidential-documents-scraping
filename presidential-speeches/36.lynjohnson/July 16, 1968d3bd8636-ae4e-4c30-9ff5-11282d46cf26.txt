Statement by the President on the Report of the President's Commission on Postal Organization.
A LITTLE OVER a year ago, I asked 10 distinguished Americans--under the chairmanship of Frederick Kappel---to conduct the most searching and exhaustive review ever undertaken of the Post Office Department.
The report of the Commission on Postal Organization renders a sobering judgment on what is required to provide for excellence in postal service in the years ahead.

The Commission has found that:

--postal service is not keeping pace with the growth of America;

--the procedures for administering executive departments of the Government are not appropriate for the post office; and

--a basic change in direction is required.
The Commission has developed recommendations for the introduction of modern management practices which it believes would lead to:

--greatly improved postal service for all Americans,

--ending the postal deficit,

--better career opportunities and working conditions for postal employees.
The Commission deserves the appreciation of the Nation for this penetrating study.
This report should be widely read and studied. I have asked the Postmaster General and the Director of the Budget to review the report carefully and report to me. I have asked Mr. Kappel to send the report to all Members of the Congress.
