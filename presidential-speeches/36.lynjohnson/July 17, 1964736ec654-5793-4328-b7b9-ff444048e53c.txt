Message to President Nasser Extending Greetings to the Conference of African Heads of State.
I EXTEND, through you, to the representatives of the nations and peoples of Africa gathered in Cairo, the friendly greetings of the Government and people of the United States of America.
As the Heads of State and of Government meet again one year after creating the Organization of African Unity at that historic Addis Ababa gathering, we are impressed with the striking progress which has been made toward African unity in peace and freedom.
Africa through the OAU has shown its capacity to deal through peaceful means with African problems, including such disputes as have arisen among its members. In this way, within the framework of the United Nations Charter, African nations are making a vital contribution to world peace.
As the OAU moves into its second year of activity, it will face new challenges which, I am sure, it will meet in the same spirit it has already demonstrated in the momentous year just past. I and the people of the United States extend to this Organization our best wishes for continued progress toward your high aims.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[President Gamal Abdel Nasser, Cairo, United Arab Republic]
