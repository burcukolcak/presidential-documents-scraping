Remarks of Farewell to General Prapass Charusathiara of Thailand.
I HAVE had a very delightful and enjoyable visit with the General and it brought back many pleasant memories of my visit to your wonderful country in 1961 when I was Vice President and was out there.
I asked about some friends that I met. We talked about our problems. We regard your friendship very highly.
We are very grateful for the contribution that you have made to our efforts in that area to resist aggression for the people there who love their freedom.
We are participating to the extent we can in helping in the economic development of your wonderful country, and we are very proud of the advancements and the contributions you have made.
I thank you, General, for coming in to see me.
I am happy to know that his visit to Walter Reed has been a success, and I will look forward to meeting him again.
Note: The President spoke shortly after 6 p.m. from the West Wing at the White House upon the departure of General Prapass and his party. General Prapass, Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, had undergone eye surgery at Waiter Reed Hospital in Washington.
