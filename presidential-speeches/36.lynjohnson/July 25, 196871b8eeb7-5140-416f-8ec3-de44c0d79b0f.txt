Statement by the President Upon Appointing the Air Quality Advisory Board.
THE AIR QUALITY ACT offers the Nation an opportunity to bring air pollution under control.
I urge all citizens who share my concern for public health and welfare to give their full support to effective air quality control programs in our States and communities.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House release announcing appointment of the 15-member board under the chairmanship of Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Wilbur J. Cohen. Other board members include representatives of State and local governments and public and private groups interested in prevention and control of air pollution. They are listed in the release (4 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs., p. 1153), which stated that the board was established under provisions of the Air Quality Act of 1967 (Public Law 90-148, 81 Stat. 485) to advise and consult with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare on policy matters relating to the implementation of the act and to make such recommendations to the President as the board deems necessary.
