July 27, 1966

Statement by the President Following Senate Committee Action on the Demonstration Cities Bill.
I APPLAUD the action of the Senate housing subcommittee today in reporting out the demonstration cities bill.
This bill offers new and exciting opportunities for our citizens in cities across the country, large and small. The action of the Senate subcommittee is good news for the future of our cities and the millions of Americans who live in cities.
The bill is the first step towards new schools, new job opportunities, adequate health and community facilities, and rapid and economical transportation. It is the first step on the road in which city dwellers can live with hope and dignity, without fear, and with a pride not only in their home and in their neighborhood, but in their entire city.
I hope that the full committee and the Senate will act promptly on this measure.
Note: The statement was read by the Deputy Press Secretary to the President, Robert H. Fleming, at his news conference at 11:50 a.m. on Wednesday, July 27, 1966. It was not made public in the form of a White House press release.
