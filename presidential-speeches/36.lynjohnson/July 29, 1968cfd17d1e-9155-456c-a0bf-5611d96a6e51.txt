Statement by the President on the Death of Dr. Charles W. Mayo.
DR. CHARLES WILLIAM MAYO was one of those rare men whose talents touch and enrich the lives of men everywhere. He won fame as a surgeon and medical administrator; the name of the great medical institution he headed has become a symbol of hope the world over; he was a real pioneer in group medical practice. In addition, Charles Mayo was a gifted educator, author, editor, and public servant. All of us are grateful for the life he lived--and saddened by his death.
Note: Dr. Mayo, who was 70, was killed on July 28 in an automobile accident near Rochester, Minn. He was the son of Dr. Charles C. Mayo who in 1864 with his brother Dr. William H. Mayo founded the Mayo Clinic in Rochester.
