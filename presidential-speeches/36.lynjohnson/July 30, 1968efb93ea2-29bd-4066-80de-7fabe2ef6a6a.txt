Proclamation 3861—Professional Photography Week

There is scarcely a single field of human endeavor which has not been influenced in some way by photography. In addition to its traditional role as a chronicle of family history and personal remembrance, photography:
—documents and reports current events, at home and abroad, in war and peace.

—assists scientists in such vital fields as astronomy, biology and physics, ocean exploration, and outer space.

—serves commerce and industry in advertising and manufacturing.

—contributes to the national security.

—provides visual aids for general and specialized educational purposes.

—aids law enforcement agencies by providing identification and fingerprint photographs.
More than 150,000 men and women are engaged as professional photographers in these various fields of endeavor. To recognize their contributions to our culture and to our economy, the Congress has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the week of August 4 through August 10, 1968, as Professional Photography Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,President of the United States of America, do hereby designate. the week of August 4 through August 10 as Professional Photography Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.
