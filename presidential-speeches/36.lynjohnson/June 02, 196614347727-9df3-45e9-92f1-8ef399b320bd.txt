Message to Provisional President Garcia-Godoy Following the Election in the Dominican Republic.
FEW PRESIDENTS have had a more complicated task than the one you successfully accomplished yesterday.
You led the Dominican people from the turbulence of civil strife to the tranquility of free elections. There can be no greater tribute.
On behalf of the United States Government and people I express sincere admiration for your wisdom, courage and tenacity.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable Hector Garcia-Godoy, Provisional President, Dominican Republic]
