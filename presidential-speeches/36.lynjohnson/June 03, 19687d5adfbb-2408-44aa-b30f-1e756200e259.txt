Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report on the United States-Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program.
To the Congress of the United States:
We in America are fortunate that our lives are almost completely free of the scourges of cholera, leprosy, exotic viruses, and parasitic diseases. Some of our citizens are still struck by tuberculosis and malnutrition, but we are making significant progress against them.
Yet in Asia today, millions are killed or crippled by those six diseases. They also continue to pose a serious threat to our fighting men stationed in Southeast Asia.
The U.S. Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program was begun in 1965 to find ways, through medical research, to eliminate or control those diseases.
I am pleased to transmit to the Congress today the annual report on that program. In slightly more than a year since the research efforts began

--Fifteen separate conferences dealing with specific diseases have been held in the United States and Asia.

--Contracts and grants were awarded for further intensive study of each disease.

--Additional steps were taken toward the development of a vaccine capable of conferring long-term immunity against cholera.
I believe you will find this report encouraging and enlightening, and I commend it to your attention.
