Message to Mrs. Oveta Culp Hobby on the Death of Former Governor William P. Hobby of Texas.
TEXAS and the Nation are diminished by the loss of Governor Hobby.
Throughout the last 30 years he was a wise, charitable, and loyal friend to me. He viewed the world with tolerant eyes and his wit and humor always salvaged a time of crisis and made it endurable.
As a Governor, as a publisher, as a counselor to the Nation's leaders, as husband, father, and friend, what he did in his lifetime and the honorable way in which he did it, should serve as an inspiration to young men of our land. For the achievements of Governor Hobby are the works of good citizenship in its noblest form.
Lady Bird and I send you, Bill and Diana, Henry and Jessica, our love and our prayers in your time of grief.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mrs. Oveta Culp Hobby, 2 Remington Lane, Houston, Texas]
