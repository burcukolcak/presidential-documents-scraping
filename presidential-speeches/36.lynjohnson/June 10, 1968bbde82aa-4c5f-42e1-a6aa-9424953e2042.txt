Remarks for the Press Following the President's Meeting With Governor Nelson Rockefeller.
Gentlemen:
I have reviewed with Governor Rockefeller, at his request, the summary of the discussions in Paris, the Vietnam situation as we see it, the tax bill and the economic situation, together with many of our domestic problems, the problems of the cities, the $78 billion worth of programs we have pending in the Congress now.
We have covered that in the few minutes we have been together.
Secretary Rusk will review and brief the Governor fully on the political and diplomatic fronts.
General Wheeler will review the military situation in Vietnam and around the world.
This meeting is the result of my statement that we would be glad to brief the candidates at any time. Governor Rockefeller found it convenient and I arranged for Secretary Rusk and General Wheeler to come here and meet with him.
This is the statement on our part. If Governor Rockefeller has anything to say to you after the briefing, I am sure you will be available out in the press lobby.
Note: The President spoke at 3:20 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House following his meeting with Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York, contender for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. During his remarks the President referred to Dean Rusk, Secretary of State, and Gen. Earle G. Wheeler, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both of whom met with the Governor during a preconvention briefing on domestic and foreign issues.
