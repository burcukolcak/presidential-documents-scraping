Special Message to the Congress Transmitting Report on New Urban Transportation Systems
To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting today a report on the study of new systems for urban transportation, entitled Tomorrow's Transportation.
Undertaken by the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in accordance with the Urban Mass Transportation Amendments of 1966, the study has involved research and analytic effort by 17 contractors over a period of 18 months. It has explored areas of transportation research and development to ease the problems of Americans who live in or commute to work in cities.
The report identifies research and development which offers promising prospects for transportation improvements in our cities in the near future. It suggests a longer term program of research and development, concentrated in areas of greatest promise and benefit.

I commend the report for study by the Congress and the concerned Federal, State and local agencies. It provides a good foundation for decisions upon the program of research and development required to develop the needed new systems of transportation for our crowded metropolitan areas.
