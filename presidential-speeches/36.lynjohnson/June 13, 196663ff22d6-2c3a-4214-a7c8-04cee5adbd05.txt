Statement by the President on Announcing His Intention To Renominate Lawrence J. O'Connor, Jr., to the Federal Power Commission.
I HAVE thoroughly reviewed and evaluated Commissioner O'Connor's service on the Federal Power Commission since his appointment by President Kennedy. I have been impressed by his integrity, conscientiousness, and the substantial contribution he has made to the Commission's deliberations. As the only member of the Commission who is an accountant, he is of special value in many of the highly technical and involved accounting questions that come to the Commission for decision. His decisions on the critical issues coming before the Commission have reflected a strong commitment to the public interest.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House release announcing the nomination for reappointment of Mr. O'Connor to a second 5-year term with the Federal Power Commission. The release stated that Mr. O'Connor, a native of Tulsa, Okla., had been educated at the Rice Institute and the Harvard Business School and had been employed in private industry for some 20 years before joining the Department of the Interior in 1959 he was appointed to the Federal Power Commission by President Kennedy on August 13, 1961.
