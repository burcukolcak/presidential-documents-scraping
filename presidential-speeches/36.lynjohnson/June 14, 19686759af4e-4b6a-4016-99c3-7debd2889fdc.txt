Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report on the National Wilderness Preservation System.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit the fourth annual report on the status of the National Wilderness Preservation System, covering the year 1967.
The Federal Government continues to carry on programs to preserve the natural beauty of our land and make outdoor recreation facilities available to all our citizens. We must also preserve, for use by this and future generations, some of the America that tempered and formed our national character.

--An America with undisturbed mountains and plains, forests, and valleys. --An America with placid lakes and lonely shores which will not be dominated by man and his technology.
--An America where a man can be alone with all the glories of nature, and can renew his spirit in solitary communion with the land.
This was the reason for the Wilderness Act.

And this is the reason why we shall not be content until we have a National Wilderness Preservation System adequately symbolic of our great national heritage.
To pursue this goal, I recently transmitted to the Congress 26 recommended additions to the National Wilderness Preservation System. I urge that the Congress take early and favorable action on them.
Each generation has its own rendezvous with the land. May ours be one that understands the heritage of America, that passes it on for the welfare and enjoyment of future generations.
