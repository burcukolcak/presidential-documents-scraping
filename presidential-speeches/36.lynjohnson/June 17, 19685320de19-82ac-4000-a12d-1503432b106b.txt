June 17, 1968

Message to Chancellor Kiesinger on the Situation in Berlin.
My dear Mr. Chancellor:
It is a matter of great regret to me that while the Federal Republic and we are pursuing objectives that I believe all mankind shares, namely to live in peace with our neighbors, Berlin is once again threatened.
Our government and yours, along with the British and French, are consulting on this latest totally unprovoked and unjustified aggravation of the situation. I want to express to you on this "Day of German Unity" that our support of free Berlin and the goal of a German people united in peace remains as firm as ever.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany]
Note: On June 11, 1968, as reported in the press, new travel regulations were imposed by East Germany on routes to West Berlin, including a visa and passport requirement, a higher transport fee for use of the autobahn, and a surtax on freight carried through East Germany by West German carriers.
The message was released at Austin, Texas.
