Statement by the President Upon Announcing His Intention To Designate Rosel H. Hyde as Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, and To Appoint Nicholas Johnson as a Member
The combination of Rosel Hyde's long FCC experience and Nicholas Johnson's demonstrated and creative abilities demonstrated throughout his teaching career and his public life will advance the public interest in the critically important work of this agency. The vital decisions relating to our rapidly changing communications industry call for the high talents possessed by these fine public servants.
Note: The statement was made public as part of a White House release announcing the appointments. The release stated that Mr. Hyde, a career employee who entered the Federal service in 1924, had been a member of the Federal Communications Commission since 1946 and had served as Chairman in 1953 and 1954. The release pointed out that he was one of the Nation's leading experts in the communications field, and had conducted the first general frequency allocation proceedings of the Federal Radio Commission in 1928 and the general television proceedings of 1949-1952 which contributed to the extension of television service.
Nicholas Johnson, the release noted, had been appointed Federal Maritime Administrator in February 1964 and had previously served as a law clerk to Justice Hugo L. Black, as a member of the law faculty of the University of California, and as an associate member of a law firm in Washington, D.C.
