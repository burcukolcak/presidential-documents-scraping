Lyndon B. Johnson
June 18, 1968

Statement by the President Following Senate Subcommittee Approval of the Gun Control Bill.
I AM delighted at the action of the Juvenile Delinquency Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee in reporting out the gun control bill I recommended to the Congress last week. I urge the full committee promptly to approve the action of its subcommittee and send the bill to the Senate floor for immediate consideration. Americans should not have to wait any longer for a strict gun control law. The time for action is now. We must give our people the protection they deserve from lethal rifles and shotguns as soon as possible.
Note: The Gun Control Act of 1968 was approved by the President on October 22, 1968 (see Item 553.)
