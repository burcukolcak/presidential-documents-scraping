CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION TO THE
11TH TACTICAL RECONNAISSANCE SQUADRON
The 11th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary gallantry in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force in Southeast Asia, from 26 July 1966 to 31 March 1967. During this period, the 11th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was responsible for providing the major portion of all daylight tactical reconnaissance and all night tactical reconnaissance over North Vietnam. Although operating under extremely difficult and dangerous conditions of an enemy air defense system that was expanding daily and becoming more complex and deadly, aircrews of the 11th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron accomplished their arduous missions in an outstanding manner. Their exemplary performance contributed significantly to the success of the United States Air Force's tactical reconnaissance program in North Vietnam. The extraordinary heroism and outstanding combat professionalism consistently displayed by the Unit's aircrews were matched by similarly superb efforts from the Squadron's maintenance and support personnel. By their gallantry, professionalism and untiring devotion to duty, personnel of the 11th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron upheld the highest standards of performance and traditions of the military service and reflected great credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.
