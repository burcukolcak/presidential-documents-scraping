The President's Foreword to the Science Advisory Committee Report "Handling of Toxicological Information."
[Released June 20, 1966. Dated June 8, 1966]
THE NUMBER of chemical compounds to which people become exposed is already vast and increasing daily. This is a result of our steadily advancing industrialization, changes in agricultural practices and advances in the biomedical sciences. All segments of our population are exposed either deliberately or in the course of daily living to many such compounds. Of particular importance are the effects of chemicals to which people may be exposed at low concentrations over prolonged periods, because in these cases the toxic effects may be subtle and difficult to discern.
The Panel on the Handling of Toxicological Information has examined the ramifications of this complicated problem of industrialized societies and has made a number of recommendations. Among these is the recommendation that there be established, by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, a computer-based facility to cope with the flood of toxicological information and to make it quickly available to people with a legitimate need for it.
Because of the widespread interest in the subject matter of this report, I have directed that it be published and made generally available.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
