The President's Telegram to His Daughter Luci on the Birth of His Grandson Patrick Lyndon Nugent.
YOU handled this superbly as you do all things. I am so happy for you and Patrick, Senior, and Patrick Lyndon. Our best Hereford heifer is being curried for delivery to the Lewis-Nugent Ranch consigned to your nine-pound son, who incidentally I know doesn't look like a donkey and I hope his father will quit publicizing him as an elephant. The time has come to get the Republicanism out of all these Waukegan products.

Love,

Daddy
[Mrs. Patrick J. Nugent, Seton Hospital, Austin, Texas]
