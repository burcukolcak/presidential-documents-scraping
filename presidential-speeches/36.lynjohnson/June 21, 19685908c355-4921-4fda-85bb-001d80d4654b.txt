Telegram on the Performance of the National Alliance of Businessmen in Aid of the Hard-Core Unemployed and Needy Youth.
[Released June 21, 1968. Dated June 20, 1968]
WARMEST congratulations to you and your National Alliance of Businessmen associates on your remarkable performance in surpassing the job pledge goal for the hard-core unemployed. You have the Nation's deep thanks for the intensive drive, long hours and hard work that you put into your campaign for these critical job commitments in the private sector.
Having attained the first milestone in your historic mission, I now urge you to redouble your efforts to secure the 200,000 jobs for needy youth in our cities this summer. When you succeed, you will have made it possible for us to achieve a 50% increase over last year in the number of summer jobs for disadvantaged youth--taking us far toward our goal of providing opportunities for all youth who want to learn and earn during the summer.
I am extremely pleased to note that your city--Detroit--and nine other cities nationally have demonstrated that the youth quota can be met. You and your associates throughout the Nation must spare no effort to match Detroit's splendid example.
I call on you to rally your forces for an all-out drive to meet your youth quota. Only you can answer the question whether this summer will be a time of hope and opportunity-or a time of frustration and despair--for the youth in our cities.
You have my best wishes for the same outstanding success in your youth drive as you have had in your hard-core campaign.
