Remarks Upon Arrival at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
I WANT to thank the band and all the good people who have come out here to give us such a warm welcome. I like your weather, I like your Governor, I am very fond of your Senators and your entire congressional delegation in Washington.
Secretary Freeman is my strong right arm. As a matter of fact, I know of no State in the Union that supplies better public servants than the State of Minnesota. And aside from all of that, I like this good Texas weather.
I want to particularly thank the band for coming out and giving us such good music.
I hope all of you have tickets to the dinner tonight. And if so, I will see you down there.
Note: The President spoke at 3 p.m.
