Memorandum Directing Full Use by Federal Agencies of the ZIP Code System.
[Released June 27, 1965. Dated June 18, 1965] THE 5-digit ZIP Code system developed by the Post Office Department will
--contribute to the development of commerce and trade by speeding the delivery of business mail.
--increase the efficiency and economy of postal operations, with resultant benefits to the taxpayers.
--permit faster communications between individuals in both their business and personal affairs.
--keep our postal system abreast of improvements in other methods of communication.
--improve the accuracy of mail deliveries.
A complete transition to the ZIP Code system will not be accomplished without substantial effort by both the Post Office Department and the general public. The full use of ZIP coding by the Government itself is essential to the proper development of the system.
I expect, therefore, that the agencies of the Government will take the lead in adopting the ZIP Code system, including the presorting of quantity mailings. The operations of Federal agencies should provide an example to private mailers who are expected to conform to the new system.
I have instructed the Postmaster General to issue regulations governing the use of the ZIP Code by all Federal agencies. These regulations will be designed to
--improve governmental services to the public.
--contribute to efficiency and economy in Government by improving the operations of all agencies, particularly those of the Post Office Department.
--provide an example to private mailers in the effective use of the ZIP Code system.
I shall expect each one of you to insure that his agency is ready to comply fully with the postmaster General's regulations on the dates which he will specify in the regulations.
The Director of the Bureau of the Budget will take appropriate action to see that forms in use throughout the Federal Government are changed as may be necessary to provide the information required for ZIP coding of addresses on Government mailings.
