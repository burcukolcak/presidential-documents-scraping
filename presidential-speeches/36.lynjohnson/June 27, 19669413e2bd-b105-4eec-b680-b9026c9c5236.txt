Statement by the President in Response to Report of the National Commission on Food Marketing.
I RECEIVED today the report of the National Commission on Food Marketing.
This report deals with a most vital subject-the structure and performance of the Nation's food marketing system.
That system is America's largest industry. Last year consumers bought $85 billion worth of food, nearly one out of every $5 they spent.
I appreciate the effort and dedication of the 15 men and women of the Commission, chaired by Judge Phil Gibson. Together, they have increased our fund of knowledge about the food industry.
As Senator Hart has stated, the Commission's report is a good beginning. No one study can contain all the answers and solutions. No one study can really be considered final--but rather part of a continual process of exploration and examination in our search for solutions.
The diversity of opinions and views in the Commission's report are healthy reflections of the complexity and importance of the issues.
I have referred the Commission's report, together with the individual dissenting views, to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget for the review and study of all interested agencies of the Government.
I know that we will also benefit by the review of the report by the Congress to which it has also been submitted.
The work of the Commission will receive careful attention and discussion in the months ahead. And it will help us in our efforts to achieve greater abundance for our society.
Note: The report, entitled "Food From Farmer to Consumer," is dated June 27, 1966 (Government Printing Office, 113 pp.).
The National Commission on Food Marketing was established in 1964 by Public Law 88-354 (78 Stat. 269),
