Statement by the President on the Reorganization of the Public Health Service.
TWO MONTHS AGO I submitted to Congress a reorganization plan to modernize the Public Health Service. Over this past weekend that plan has become a reality.
I want to express my deep appreciation to the Congress for this important measure. Together we have taken another forward step in our unremitting efforts to improve Government, to bring it up to date, and to make it a modern instrument of service for our citizens.
This is a particularly significant reorganization.
For the first time in over two decades, the Public Health Service can be reshaped to perform its vital role of matching the miracles of modern medicine to the needs of all Americans. It will help us achieve the full promise of the landmark health measures enacted by the 89th Congress.
Since 1953 more than 50 new medical programs have been placed in the Public Health Service. Its budget over the past 12 years has increased tenfold--from $250 million to $2.4 billion.
Before this reorganization plan became effective the Public Health Service was obsolete in its organization, a major obstacle to the fulfillment of the Nation's health goals.
Now, under the new reorganization plan, the Public Health Service can be strengthened and streamlined.
I have asked Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare John Gardner and Surgeon General William Stewart to move ahead as rapidly as possible to carry out the new plan. Under their leadership the Public Health Service will operate more efficiently and effectively as it conducts the medical research and develops the resources we need to build a better, healthier tomorrow for all our people.
