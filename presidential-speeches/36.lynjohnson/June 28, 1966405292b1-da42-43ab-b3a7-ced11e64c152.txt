Lyndon B. Johnson
June 28, 1966

Statement by the President Following House Committee Approval of the Demonstration Cities Bill.
I APPLAUD the action taken by the House Banking and Currency Committee this morning in its overwhelming approval of the administration's Demonstration Cities Act. This is vital legislation--important to the future of American cities, large and small.
It will help rebuild where there is blight and renew where there is decay. This is good news for the future of every city in America and the citizens that live in our cities.
It will allow the cities, the Federal Government, and private enterprise to join together in a common effort to achieve the goal of the better life for all our people.
Note: The Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966 was approved by the President on November 3, 1966 (see Item 574).
The statement was posted on the bulletin board in the Press Room at the White House. It was not made public in the form of a White House press release.
