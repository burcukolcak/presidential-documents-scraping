Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission
In your joint letter to me of May 18, 1964, you recommended that I approve a proposed new NATO 144b Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and all other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, for cooperation relevant to the exchange of atomic information for NATO planning purposes.
Having considered your joint recommendations and the cooperation provided for in the proposed new agreement, including security safeguards and other terms and conditions of the agreement, I hereby:
(1) determine that the performance of this proposed new agreement will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to the common defense and security; and
(2) approve the proposed agreement and authorize its execution for the Government of the United States in a manner designated by the Secretary of State.
