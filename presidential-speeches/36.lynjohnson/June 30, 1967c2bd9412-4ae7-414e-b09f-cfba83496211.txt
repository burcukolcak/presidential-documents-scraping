Statement by the President Upon Signing Proclamation Reducing the Level of Dairy Imports.
I HAVE today signed a proclamation which will reduce dairy imports to the normal level which prevailed before 1966. On the basis of these new quotas, annual imports will be approximately 1 billion pounds of milk equivalent.
This action has been taken on the recommendation of the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, and numerous Members of Congress concerned.
Dairy imports from 1961 through 1965 averaged 850 million pounds of milk equivalent annually. 1965 imports were 900 million pounds. The level established by this action will permit us to meet all existing international commitments and will restore dairy imports to historic and normal levels. This action is of benefit to all Americans:
--It will help the dairy farmer to obtain a fair return.
--It will save tax dollars of between 100 and 200 million annually from lower Government purchases of dairy products.
--It will provide the consumer with more stable domestic production at no increase in milk prices.
--It will still permit us to honor our trade commitments to other nations.
Note: The President referred to Proclamation 3790 "Proclamation Amending Part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States With Respect to the Importation of Agricultural Commodities" (3 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs., p. 968; 32 F.R. 9803; 3 CFR, 1967 Comp., p. 57).
The statement was released at San Antonio, Texas.
