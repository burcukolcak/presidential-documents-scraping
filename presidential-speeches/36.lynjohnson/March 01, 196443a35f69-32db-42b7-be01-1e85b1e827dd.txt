Lyndon B. Johnson
March 01, 1964

Remarks Recorded for the Opening of the Red Cross Campaign.
FOR more than 100 years, the Red Cross has united people everywhere as a common bond of mercy and decency.
Today, around the world, the familiar red cross is the most universally known and the most respected symbol of man's concern for the well-being of his fellow man.
Here in our own land, we know the American Red Cross as a true friend, always standing by, always ready, always able to assist any of us.
Red Cross programs touch the lives of millions of families through vital health, through emergency welfare programs. The services of the Red Cross are available to all of our people at all times--in moments of community disaster as well as in hours of individual despair.
But the readiness and the strength of the Red Cross depend upon the support that we ourselves provide.
As President of the United States of America, and as Honorary Chairman of the Red Cross, it gives me great pleasure to proclaim the month of March as the Red Cross month.
So, I urge each of you to observe this month by supporting your Red Cross, supporting your Red Cross in every way you can. We never know when the help of the Red Cross will be needed by others, or we never know when it will be needed by ourselves. But by giving our help now, we can be sure that the Red Cross will always be able to answer all the calls of distress and need wherever and whenever those calls may Come.
Note: The President had designated March 1964 as Red Cross Month on January 31 (Proclamation 3572; 29 F.R. 1717; 3 CFR, 1964 Supp.). His remarks were filmed and recorded in advance for broadcast at the opening of the campaign.
