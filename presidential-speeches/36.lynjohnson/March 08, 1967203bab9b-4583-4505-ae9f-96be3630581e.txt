Message to the Congress Transmitting Third Joint Annual Report on the National Wilderness Preservation System.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit to the Congress the Third Annual Report on the status of the National Wilderness Preservation System.
The National Wilderness Preservation System, established by the Wilderness Act of 1964, protects and preserves a priceless legacy--the wilderness of America. Under this Act, we hold in trust for future generations more than nine million acres of forest, mountains and streams.
--areas free from the imprint of man
--areas where nature alone has left its mark.
This in itself is a great achievement. But our responsibility for preserving America's natural heritage does not end here.
The Congress has recognized this continuing responsibility and has called for a review of the Nation's primitive and unspoiled areas for possible addition to the Wilderness System. I welcome that task. I have submitted legislation to authorize the first addition to the Wilderness System since its establishment--the San Rafael Wilderness, Los Padres National Forest, California. I will submit further recommendations later this year.
This is important work.
The wilderness and primitive areas of this Nation are a priceless heritage. That heritage is ours to preserve or to destroy.
America has made its choice.
We shall not rest until the job is done.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
