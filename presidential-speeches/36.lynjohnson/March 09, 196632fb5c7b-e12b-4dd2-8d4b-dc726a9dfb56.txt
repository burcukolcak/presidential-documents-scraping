Lyndon B. Johnson

Statement by the President in Connection With the Message on Crime and Law Enforcement.
UNTIL our streets are safe for every woman and every child, we cannot call ourselves a truly civilized nation.
Until we root out drug addiction, we cannot call ourselves a truly healthy nation.
Until we can sleep safely in our homes and work peacefully in our shops, we cannot call ourselves a truly law-abiding nation.
Until we can safeguard all our children from the perils of delinquency, we cannot call ourselves a truly progressive nation.
The cost of crime to our economy is nearly $30 billion a year--more than all of us together spend for medical care. This must and can be stopped.
I call upon every American, as I have today called upon the Congress, to join in a national, unified campaign to reverse the rising tide of crime in American life.
Note: The President also recorded the statement for radio and television broadcast.
