Message to President Sunay of Turkey on the 20th Anniversary of the Truman Doctrine.
ON THE twentieth anniversary of the Truman Doctrine, I extend to you and to the Turkish people my good wishes. Then as now, the American people admire the vitality and the passion for freedom of the Turkish people. Then as now, the United States is proud of its association with the forward-looking Turkish nation.
Turkey has been a sturdy ally in NATO and CENTO. Its men played an unforgettable part with the United Nations forces which assured that aggression would not succeed in Korea.
With its security assured by its own courage and efforts, united with those of its allies, Turkey has moved forward remarkably in economic and social development. The vision of a modern Turkey, not only loyal to its own traditions and ambitions, but also a creative part of the world of contemporary science, technology, and industry, has been brought measurably closer to reality.
The visit you will soon be making to the United States affords an opportunity to give added meaning to that association. It will also serve as a symbol of the importance of the partnership of our two great republics. Mrs. Johnson and I are looking forward to welcoming you and Mrs. Sunay.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
