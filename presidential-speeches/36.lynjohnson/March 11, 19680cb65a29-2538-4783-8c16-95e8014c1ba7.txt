Lyndon B. Johnson
March 11, 1968

Statement by the President on the Senate's Action in Passing the Civil Rights Bill.
EVERY AMERICAN can be proud of the Senate's action today.
By an overwhelming vote, the Senate has once again affirmed our Nation's commitment to human rights under law.
Bringing this debate to a close required more than perseverance. It required a dedication to America's fundamental ideals--and a determination to serve those ideals through law. In an hour of contention and stress, those who work within the law to enlarge the liberties of all men are the true peacemakers--and they deserve the thanks of their countrymen.
Now the House becomes the arena where these great issues will be tested.
I believe that the Members of the House-having once said that every family has the right to the kind of shelter it desires and can afford, having once said that Americans should be protected in the exercise of their basic rights, and having often expressed their will to curb violence in our cities--will reaffirm their support for the policies contained in this measure.
I hope this bill will soon be before me for signing into law. I salute those who this day acted to bring that time--and a more perfect Union--closer to hand.
Note: The Civil Rights Act of 1968 was approved by the President on April 11, 1968 (see Item 195).
