In accordance with the requirement of Section 4(g) of the Department of Transportation Act, I am forwarding for the information of the Congress a joint report and recommendations by the Secretaries of the Department of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development on the logical and efficient location of urban mass transportation functions in the Executive Branch.
This report contains a valuable summary of studies and deliberations conducted by the two Secretaries over the past year. Reorganization Plan 2, which I transmitted to the Congress on February 26, 1968, will carry into effect those recommendations requiring action by the Congress.
