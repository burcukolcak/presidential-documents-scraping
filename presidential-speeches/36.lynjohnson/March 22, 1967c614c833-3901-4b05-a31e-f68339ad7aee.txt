Statement by the President Upon Signing Order Providing Emergency Feed for Livestock Owned by Indians in Disaster Areas.
IN MY 1967 State of the Union Message, I called for self-help assistance to the American Indians as "the forgotten in our midst." I am pleased to provide the means for rapid assistance to those needy Indians whose plight is compounded by acts of nature beyond their control.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House press release which announced that feed would be distributed to needy members of Indian tribes who graze livestock on reservations or other lands designated for Indian use.
The release stated that under delegated authority the Secretary of Agriculture would make available in natural disaster areas feed owned by the Commodity Credit Corporation.
On the same day the President signed Executive Order 11336 "Delegating to the Secretary of Agriculture Certain Authority Relating to Emergency Livestock Feed" (3 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs., p. 526; 32 F.R. 4489; 3 CFR, 1967 Comp. p. 265).
