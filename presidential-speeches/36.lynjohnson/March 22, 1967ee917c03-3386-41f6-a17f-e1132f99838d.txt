Message to the Congress Transmitting First Annual Report on the Operation of the Automotive Products Agreement With Canada.
[Released March 22, 1967. Dated March 21, 1967]
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit to the Congress the First Annual Report on the operation of the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965. By this Act Congress authorized implementation of the United States-Canada Automotive Products Agreement.
This historic Agreement is a joint undertaking by the United States and Canada to create a broader market for automotive products, to liberalize automotive trade between the two countries, and to establish conditions conducive to the most efficient patterns of investment, production and trade in this critical industry. It is symbolic of the spirit of cooperation between these two friendly neighbors.
The first year of operations under the Act provides solid proof of its importance. The value of total trade in automotive products between the United States and Canada during 1966 exceeded $2 billion--compared with approximately $1.1 billion in 1965. The benefits to the 'people of both countries are impressive and fully detailed in the Report.
