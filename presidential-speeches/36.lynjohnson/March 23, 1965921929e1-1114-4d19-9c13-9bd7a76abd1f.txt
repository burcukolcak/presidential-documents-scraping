Statement by the President on the Flight of Gemini 3.
ON BEHALF of an appreciative and admiring Nation, I am proud to extend congratulations to Virgil Grissom and John Young on their successful flight and safe return.
The historic flight today is a further measure of the unlimited role man has to play in the exploration and peaceful use of the endless frontier of space.
We can be especially proud that our orderly 'program for space exploration is producing the successes we have hoped for as we had planned them.
Today's flight is an impressive testament to the teamwork of our fine talents--to men like Jim Webb, Dr. Dryden, and Dr. Seamans--who have worked together so successfully on Project Mercury and now on this important first step of Project Gemini. To all who have contributed to this endeavor I want to say: Well done.
