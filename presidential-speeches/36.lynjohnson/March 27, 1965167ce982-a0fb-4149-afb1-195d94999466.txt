Lyndon B. Johnson
March 27, 1965

Statement by the President on the Record of Federal Agencies in Reducing Personnel Levels.
THE COOPERATION of all the executive branches has been outstanding. I am proud of the results which are being obtained without impairing the quality or quantity of vital Federal services. The closer scrutiny of our manpower practices will, I am certain, serve to enhance the efficiency of the Federal establishment. I hope you will convey to all concerned my personal appreciation and congratulations.
Note: The statement was part of a White House release which stated that it was made in response to a report from the Bureau of the Budget on February employment in the executive branch.
The report showed, the release stated, a total of 2,447,897 for regular executive branch employment in February 1965. This was a decrease of 4,381 from January 1965, and 10,614 below the level of February 1964. Significant changes from February 1964, by department and agency, were listed in the release as follows:
Defense, down 22,385 due to lower Presidentially approved ceilings;
Interior, down 420, due to fighter manpower controls;
AID, down 1,108, largely the result of tighter employment controls on overseas foreign nationals;
Federal Aviation Agency, down 567, due to consolidation of facilities and stringent management controls;
Veterans Administration, down 1,847, due to decline in the use of part-time medical consultants to reach lower employment targets;
Commerce, up 1,274, chiefly census of agriculture temporaries;
Health, Education, and Welfare, up 1,408, due to expanded Public Health services and consumer protection legislation, and new programs in Office of Education and Welfare Administration;
Post Office, up 4,259, primarily to curtail the excessive use of overtime and to handle the increased volume of mail;
General Services Administration, up 1,686, primarily for management of new buildings, newly activated transportation and communication facilities, and expanded Federal Supply support.
