Lyndon B. Johnson
March 27, 1965

Statement by the President Following House Action on the Education Bill.
THE ACTION of the House of Representatives in passing the education bill represents the greatest breakthrough in the advance of education since the Constitution was written.
In our country there are millions of people who comprise families living off less than $2,000 a year. Most of these people have been denied the chance to go to a good school long enough to equip themselves to earn more.
The taxes of the American people now help to support most of these people who cannot support themselves, because they haven't the basic education to do so.
This is why education is our number one priority. This is why we are insisting that every child be guaranteed all the education he or she can take.
If this bill is finally enacted by the Congress and we improve it in the years to come, it will be the best and most durable insurance we can have to face the stiff competition of the world.
This education bill is made up of children and hope and jobs. Children learn to read and write and understand. Hope fills the hearts of men and their families. Then, jobs will be available because they are trained to do something instead of being hopelessly bogged down in wasted lives and stunted minds.
I am very proud of the leadership of the House and all the Members who stood up to be counted on the side of the future. I am confident that the United States Senate will move with dispatch and enthusiasm to speed the final passage of the bill.
Note: The bill was passed by the Senate on April 9 and approved by the President on April 11, 1965. For the President's remarks upon signing, see Item 181.
