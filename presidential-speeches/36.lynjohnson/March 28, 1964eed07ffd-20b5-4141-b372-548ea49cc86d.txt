Statement by the President on the Earthquake in Alaska.
ALL Americans will join me in extending the warmest sympathy to our countrymen in Alaska in the face of the terrible earthquake which has hit their State.
This sympathy will be backed by action. From the first moment the Commander in Chief Alaska, Lt. Gen. Raymond J. Reeves, has been directing his command to the tasks of relief, and at my direction all Federal agencies are joining in support of this effort.
To ensure full Federal action, and in accordance with the law, I have declared a disaster area in Alaska, and I have assured Governor Egan that all possible help will be made available.
General Gruenther of the Red Cross has reported to us that this great organization is already at work to extend help to those who need it. Red Cross medical teams and experts in disaster relief are already on the way.
All Alaskans and all Americans will pull together to meet and overcome this blow.
Note: On April 2 the President issued Executive Order 11150 "Establishing the Federal Reconstruction and Development Planning Commission for Alaska" (29 F.R. 4789; 3 CFR, 1964 Supp.). The White House announced on April 4 that the President had made available $5 million in Federal disaster relief funds for Alaska.
On April 14 the White House released a progress report to the President by the Federal Reconstruction and Development Planning Commission in the form of a letter from the Chairman, Clinton P. Anderson, dated April 10, highlighting the work accomplished since the earthquake.
