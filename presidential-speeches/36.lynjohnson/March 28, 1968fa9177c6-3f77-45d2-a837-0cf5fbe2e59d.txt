Statement by the President on the Death of Yuri Gagarin.
YURI GAGARIN'S courageous and pioneering flight into space opened new horizons and set a brilliant example for the spacemen of our two countries. I extend the deep sympathy of the American people to his family and to relatives of Colonel Engineer Vladimir Seryogin.
Note: Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin and his copilot, Vladimir Seryogin, were killed on March 27 when their jet plane crashed northeast of Moscow during a routine training flight.
The statement was read to members of the press by George E. Christian, Special Assistant to the President, in his office at the White House at 12:32 p.m. on Thursday, March 28, 1968. It was not made public in the form of a White House press release. A similar message was sent to the Soviet Government.
