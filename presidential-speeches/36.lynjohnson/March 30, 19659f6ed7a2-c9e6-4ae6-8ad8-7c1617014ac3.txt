Lyndon B. Johnson
March 30, 1965

Statement by the President on the Bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon.
THE TERRORIST outrage aimed at the American Embassy in Saigon shows us once again what the struggle in Viet-Nam is about. This wanton act of ruthlessness has brought death and serious injury to innocent Vietnamese citizens in the street as well as to American and Vietnamese personnel on duty. I extend my deepest sympathy to the families of all who lost their lives.
Outrages like this will only reinforce the determination of the American people and Government to continue and to strengthen their assistance and support for the people and Government of Viet-Nam. The embassy is already back in business, and I shall at once request the Congress for authority and funds for the immediate construction of a new chancery for the American Embassy in Saigon. This will be one more symbol of our solidarity with the people of Viet-Nam. It is they who are the real targets of the Communist aggressors.
Led by Ambassador Johnson, the Americans in Viet-Nam have once again shown outstanding qualities of courage and coolness. They have the admiration of their countrymen.
Note: On April t the President transmitted a draft bill to Congress authorizing construction of a new chancery in Saigon (see Item 152).
In the last paragraph the President referred to U. Alexis Johnson, Deputy Ambassador to Viet-Nam.
