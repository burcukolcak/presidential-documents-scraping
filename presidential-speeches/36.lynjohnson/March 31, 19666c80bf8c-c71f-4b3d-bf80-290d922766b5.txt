Remarks Upon Signing Bill Authorizing Medals Commemorating the 250th Anniversary of the Founding of San Antonio.
Senator Yarborough, Representative Gonzalez:
I am most pleased that you could be here today for this very satisfying occasion.
This bill authorizes the striking of medals in commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the founding of San Antonio. The occasion is a proud one.
San Antonio is a great American city-rich in culture, traditions, and memories. It is a city founded on bravery and nurtured by determination.
It is a city that occupies a special place in the heart of every Texan--and really in the heart of every American. For me, it holds an even added significance. It was there that Mrs. Johnson and I were married 31 years ago.
But San Antonio is much more than just a city of memories. It is a growing, vibrant, and exciting city, very much a part of 20th century America. And that is the real meaning of this authorization. I am confident that it is a barometer that foretells the success of Hemisfair 1968 as an international exposition.
Hemisfair 1968 is San Antonio's way of telling the world that progress is the wave of its future. And this bill is the Nation's way of seconding the motion.
And so I sign this bill with best wishes for the future success of a great city and its splendid citizens.
