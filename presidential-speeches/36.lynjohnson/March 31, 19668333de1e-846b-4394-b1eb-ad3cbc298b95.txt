Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Authorizing Appropriations for the Coast Guard.
I HAVE today approved H.R. 12762 which authorizes appropriations of $126,079,000 for the fiscal year 1967 for the procurement of vessels and aircraft and construction of shore and offshore establishments for the Coast Guard.
This authorization is $23,079,000 in excess of my request. These additional authorizations added by Congress are intended to accelerate the Coast Guard's vessel, aviation, shore units and housing replacement and augmentation programs.
The funds I requested for these programs in the 1967 budget are commensurate with the authorization originally requested, rather than the amounts included in H.R. 12762.
The funds the administration requested in the 1967 budget take into account the several long-range programs of the Coast Guard. The aviation program is being funded at an increase of $4 million over the 1966 level. In all respects except the establishment of additional new helicopter air stations, accomplishment of the aviation program is on schedule. All necessary actions for safety and effectiveness of on-going aviation operations are being taken. The 1967 budget, moreover, provides for the sixth of a total of fifteen new air stations called for by the aviation program.
The program for shore units is in its initial year in 1966 with funding of $10.2 million. This is increased in the 1967 budget to $13.8 million.
Three hundred and ninety-nine sets of public family quarters are being budgeted in 1967 at a cost of $6.7 million. This substantial budget request follows closely the 1966 acquisition of 548 sets of quarters at Fort Jay on Governors Island, New York. Although the Coast Guard has been deficient in provision of housing for its families, very substantial progress will be continued at the budget level which was requested.
For the vessel replacement and augmentation program, three of the largest cutters are budgeted in 1967 just as three were budgeted in 1966.
The 1967 budget for vessels differs from that for 1966 primarily in that it makes no request for 210 foot length medium endurance vessels, five of which were included in 1966 funding. Sixteen of the new medium vessels have been funded thus far of a total program requirement of 30. It has become apparent that perhaps a smaller vessel can be employed effectively at lower cost in many of the situations for which 210 foot length vessels were originally planned. A 1-year pause in construction of these vessels is desirable in order to develop new plans. Funds are provided in the 1967 budget for this planning and also for design of a ship for oceanographic work and for studies leading to the design of a class of replacement icebreakers.
In all areas other than new vessel construction the 1967 budget equals or exceeds that of 1966.
Thus, while I have approved this measure, I consider the funds requested for the Coast Guard in the 1967 budget adequate for Coast Guard operations. Therefore I do not intend to revise my budget request to fund this unnecessary increase.
Note: As enacted, the bill (H.R. 12762), approved by the President on March 30, is Public Law 89-381 (80 Stat. 96).
