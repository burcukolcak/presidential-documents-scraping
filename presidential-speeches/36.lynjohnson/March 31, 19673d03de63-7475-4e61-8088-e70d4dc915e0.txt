Congressman Gonzalez, Mr. Mayor, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:
We have had a very delightful trip from Washington coming to this beautiful city of San Antonio.
We have visited individually with most of our neighbors in this hemisphere.
We have talked about our problems and our future.
Now we are going to enjoy a wonderful Texas weekend here as your guests to visit with you and exchange views about what is to come.
We thank you so much for all the time and talent that has gone into this planning.
We are so grateful to you for giving us this wonderful welcome.
Thank you very much.
