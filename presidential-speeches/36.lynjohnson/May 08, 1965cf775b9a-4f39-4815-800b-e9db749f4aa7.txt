Statement by the President on the Work Performed in Disaster Areas by Members of the Neighborhood Youth Corps.
SECRETARY of Labor Wirtz has just informed me that almost 5,000 young men and women of the Neighborhood Youth Corps are helping to repair public facilities severely damaged last month by floods and tornadoes.
Five States took immediate advantage of the special projects Secretary Wirtz offered to establish for disaster control and reclamation.
In Wisconsin, 3,000 Youth Corps enrollees will help repair the flood damage. Arkansas has projects for 100 young people to work in the reclamation of areas hit by tornadoes. Flood-damaged Michigan will have 300 youths helping in the restoration work. Missouri will be assisted by 50 NYC enrollees. Minnesota, where NYC enrollees were first put to work aiding disaster-stricken areas, has a project for an additional 500 youths to help in the reclamation.
I am pleased by the quick response and effective action taken by the Governors of these States to use the Labor Department's Neighborhood Youth Corps in this emergency. I am sure that the young people who will work in the restoration of public properties will feel a true sense of accomplishment and community service.
