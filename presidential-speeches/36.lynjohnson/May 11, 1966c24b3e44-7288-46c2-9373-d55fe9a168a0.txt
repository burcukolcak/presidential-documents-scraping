Letter to the U.S. National Chairman for United Nations Day.
[Released May 11, 1966. Dated April 30, 1966]
Dear Mr. Kaiser:
I appreciate greatly your consenting to serve this year as U.S. National Chairman for United Nations Day.
UN Day should have special significance for Americans. The United States has provided both birthplace and homeplace for the United Nations; the UN has enjoyed warm bipartisan support from five U.S. Presidents, from the Congress and from an overwhelming majority of the American people. Support for the United Nations has been a major element of U.S. foreign policy since 1945.
As UN Day Chairman, I know that you, with the cooperation of the various State Governors, Mayors and other local officials, will encourage appropriate observances of this commemorative event throughout the country. This year the United Nations is twenty-one years old, and Americans should join other peoples of the world in welcoming it to majority.
I am happy that I can count on your outstanding talents and ability for this important job.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mr. Edgar F. Kaiser, 300 Lakeside Drive, Oakland, Calif.]
