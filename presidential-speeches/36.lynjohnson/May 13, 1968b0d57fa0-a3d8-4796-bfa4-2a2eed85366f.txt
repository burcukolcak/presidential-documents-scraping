Message to the Congress Transmitting First Annual Report on Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Programs.
To the Congress of the United States:
This year, we can expect 53,000 Americans to die on our Nation's highways.
We can expect almost 4 million Americans to be injured in automobile accidents--nearly 10,000 people hurt every day.
We can expect automobile fatalities to be the largest cause of death in the 15 to 35 age group.
Year after year, those expectations become gruesome reality.
In 1966, we took our first major step to combat this shameful waste. And now I am pleased to transmit to the Congress the first annual report of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966.

This report covers the period between September 9, 1966, and December 31, 1967, and I believe it shows a promising beginning. During this period

--Two hundred safety-related recall campaigns were conducted by the motor vehicle industry.

--The first Federal motor vehicle standards in history were issued and are already in application on all cars manufactured after January 1 of this year.

--Additional standards were issued for vehicles manufactured after January 1, 1969.

--A sound research program has been begun, to provide a firm basis for future safety standards for vehicles and for State safety programs.
Our efforts are beginning to tell: the rate of increase of traffic deaths has slowed somewhat. Still, the destruction wrought by Americans on themselves, their fellow citizens, and their property is of tragic proportions.
I hope that this report will encourage the Congress to continue its support for these programs, and I commend it to your attention.
