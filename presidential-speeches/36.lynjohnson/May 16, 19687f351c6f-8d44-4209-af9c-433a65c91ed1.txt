CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF

THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION

TO THE

355TH TACTICAL FIGHTER WING
The 355th Tactical Fighter Wing, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism and outstanding professionalism while participating in combat operations in Southeast Asia from 1 January 1966 to 10 October 1966. During this period aircrew members and support personnel demonstrated exceptional valor and outstanding devotion to duty in the face of extremely difficult circumstances. Flying over 11,000 sorties, many against the most heavily defended targets in North Vietnam, the Wing expended 36,091 tons of bombs, 22,224 rockets, 101 missiles and 1,160,000 rounds of 20 mm ammunition to inflict severe damage to a major military complex, an enemy arsenal, key transportation facilities, surface-to-air missile sites and major fuel storage areas. These sorties destroyed large quantities of war materiel and made the enemy's movement of equipment, personnel and supplies into South Vietnam more costly and difficult. In addition, two enemy aircraft were destroyed and eight were damaged in aerial combat. Support personnel of the Wing not only were able to maintain the high sortie rate despite the severe weather conditions and battle damage to the aircraft but also made major improvements in the base to greatly increase its efficiency and to increase its capacity three-fold. The extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, aggressiveness and dedication to mission accomplishment displayed by members of the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing have reflected the highest credit upon themselves and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Air Force.
