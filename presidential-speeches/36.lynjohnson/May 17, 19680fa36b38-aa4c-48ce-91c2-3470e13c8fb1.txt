Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report on the Operation of the Automotive Products Agreement With Canada.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit to the Congress the second annual report on the operation of the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965. By this Act Congress authorized implementation of the United States-Canada Automotive Products Agreement.
The Agreement was designed to create a broader U.S.-Canadian market for automotive products to obtain for both countries and both industries the benefits of specialization and large-scale production. We have moved far toward this goal.
Automotive trade between the United States and Canada was $730 million in 1964, the year before the Agreement went into force. Trade in 1967 was over $3.3 billion. The Agreement has also stimulated increased trade in allied products.
Industry, labor and consumers in both countries continue to benefit from this growth in commerce and from the increased efficiency made possible by the Agreement. It is dramatic proof of what can be accomplished when friends and neighbors choose the path of cooperation.
