Lyndon B. Johnson
May 19, 1966

Statement by the President Upon the Death of Theodore Francis Green.
THEODORE GREEN was one of the first men I met when I came to Congress. Through all my years of public life he remained a friend and inspiration. I was not alone in those whose lives were strongly influenced by him and who felt deeply honored to work beside him. He championed integrity. He was a gentleman. His service to his Nation is the legacy he sought to leave. It will be an enduring memorial to a wise and honorable man.
Note: Senator Green served as U.S. Senator from Rhode Island from January 1937 until his retirement in January 1961.
The statement was read by Bill D. Moyers, Special Assistant to the President, at his news conference at 11:15 a.m. on Thursday, May 19, 1966, at the White House. It was not made public in the form of a White House press release.
