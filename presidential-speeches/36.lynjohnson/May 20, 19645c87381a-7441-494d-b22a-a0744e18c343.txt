Letter to the Under Secretary of the Navy Concerning the Showing of a National Anthem Trailer film.
Dear Mr. Fay:
Through the efforts and cooperation of the Council of Motion Picture Organizations, Incorporated, and the Theater Owners of America, Incorporated, the Allied States Association of Motion Picture Exhibitors, the Independent Theater Owners Association, the Metropolitan Motion Picture Theater Association, and the Allied Motion Picture Theater Owners of Maryland, Incorporated, a National Anthem trailer film will soon be included in the daily program of most of the motion picture theaters across the nation.
This patriotic gesture on the part of the theater organizations and owners will give many equally patriotic Americans a chance to pause briefly and reflect on their individual responsibilities as citizens of the greatest country in the world and to give thanks for the blessings of our land. It is especially fitting that the first showing of this film will be on May 29th, the birthday of our late President John F. Kennedy. I hope that the showing of this film will continue forever.
I shall appreciate it if you will express my appreciation to the organizations who have made this showing possible and accept my thanks for the significant role which you have personally had in this worthwhile project.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable Paul B. Fay, Jr., Under Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D.C.]
