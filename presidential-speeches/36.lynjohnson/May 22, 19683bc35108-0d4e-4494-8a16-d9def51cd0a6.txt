CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION TO THE 602D FIGHTER SQUADRON
The 602d Fighter Squadron, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism while engaged in military operations against an opposing armed force in Southeast Asia from 1 July 1965 to 30 June 1966. During this period, flying A-1E aircraft, personnel of the 602d Fighter Squadron accomplished close air support, armed reconnaissance, forward air control, and search and rescue missions under the most hazardous and demanding conditions. Their collective efforts have resulted in the recovery and rescue of 72 downed friendly pilots from hostile territory. Pitting slow, vulnerable, propeller driven aircraft against intense ground fire and tropical monsoon storms, members of this squadron contributed significantly to the interdiction of troops and supplies moving south and to the defeat of the Viet Cong Monsoon Offensive. Despite heavy losses of aircraft and pilots, the members of the 602d Fighter Squadron displayed extraordinary gallantry, professionalism, and combat effectiveness in performing one of the most varied and dangerous mission assignments in Southeast Asia. The outstanding courage, esprit de corps, and dedication to mission accomplishment displayed by the members of the 602d Fighter Squadron exemplify the highest military traditions and standards of performance and their actions reflect great credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.
