Memorandum on the Need for Action To Prevent Oil Pollution of Coastal-Waters
Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Transportation
The recent oil spillage disaster off the coast of England and the oil pollution episode on the northeast coast of this country resulted in tragic harm to marine life and waterfowl, ruined vast stretches of natural recreational facilities, and imposed a tremendous cost in human effort and economic resources. It is imperative that we take prompt action to prevent similar catastrophes in the future and to insure that the Nation is fully equipped to minimize the threat from such accidents to health, safety, and our natural resources.
I am asking you to undertake, on an urgent basis, a study to determine how best to mobilize the resources of the Federal Government and the Nation to meet this problem. I would like you to co-chair the project and report to me within ninety days on the steps taken to implement this memorandum with recommendations as to what additional authority is necessary to assure an effective national and international program.
The study should contain a thorough assessment of the existing resources, legal authorities and capabilities of the Federal Government and the private sector, as well as recommendations as to where the responsibilities for any new programs should be placed. In your study, you should also seek the appropriate participation and draw fully upon the resources and experience of other interested Government agencies, industry, labor, and the scientific community.
Your effort should not be limited to oil spillage alone but should include other pollutants and hazardous substances. Among the areas which you should consider are:
--The prevention of oil spillage accidents through the design of vessels and through control of the movement of vessels carrying these materials.
--Techniques for detection, recovery, and neutralization of spilled pollutants.
--Techniques for minimizing harm to marine and other wildlife.
--Preventative measures relating to offshore production of oil and other minerals.
--Opportunities for broad international cooperation in the program.
--Development of contingency plans to deal with these emergencies.
--Evaluation of research and development projects and priorities.
Some efforts are already underway. Representatives of your Departments and the Corps of Engineers have visited the site of the Torrey Canyon disaster. The National Council on Marine Resources and Engineering Development has investigated the subject. Representatives of this Government have participated in an emergency meeting of the Intergovernmental Marine Consultative Organization which is comprised of representatives of many countries. A special study group representing the Department of Interior's Water Pollution Control Administration, the Coast Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers has been formed to consider the problem. The long-standing United States National Committee for the Prevention of Pollution of the Seas by Oil has taken up the problem in emergency sessions as has the Oil Pollution Industry Advisory Panel of the Merchant Marine Council.
These existing groups should be fully utilized as you conduct your study.

Note: According to press reports, the 936-foot tanker Torrey Canyon, carrying 118,000 tons of crude oil, ran aground on March 18, 1967, approximately 15 miles off Land's End on the west coast of Britain. Oil spillage affected over 75 miles of coastline, damaging recreational facilities and injuring marine life and waterfowl.
On April 16, 1967, an oil slick, thought to have originated from a tanker sunk off the coast of New Jersey during World War II, caused similar damage to a 40-mile stretch of Cape Cod, Mass.
The study requested by the President resulted in a joint report, dated February 1968 and entitled "Oil Pollution--A Report to the President on Pollution of the Nation's Waters by Oil and Other Hazardous Substances" (Government Printing Office, 31 pp.).
