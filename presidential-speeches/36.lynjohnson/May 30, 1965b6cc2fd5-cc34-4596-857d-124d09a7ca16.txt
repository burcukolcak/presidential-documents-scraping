Statement by the President on Announcing the Winners of the 1965 Presidential Safety Awards.
WE CAN prevent this most senseless of all wastes. I intend to have all department and agency heads pursue vigorously the safety policy I have set. The awards announced today indicate that these agencies, all first-time winners, have set a pace that others will be expected to match.
Note: The statement (issued at Austin, Tex.) was part of a release announcing the selection of the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, and the Government Printing Office as the agencies to receive the Awards. Honorable Mention Certificates would go to the Air Force, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Federal Communications Commission.
The President's Safety Awards, the release stated, "are bestowed annually to those agencies, in three categories based on the number of employees, which in the previous year did the best job in reducing accidents to their employees." See also Item 73
