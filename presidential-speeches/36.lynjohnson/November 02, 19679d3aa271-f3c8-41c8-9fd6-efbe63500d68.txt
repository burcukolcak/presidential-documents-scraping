Message Greeting Members of the Foreign Service on Foreign Service Day.
I AM HAPPY to greet members of the Foreign Service of the United States on this day dedicated in their honor.
Foreign affairs today involve a vast range of relationships between peoples: information programs, cultural programs, technical assistance programs, educational exchanges, and international trade, to name only a few.
Although every major department and agency of the national government is now concerned with some phase of foreign policy, our ability to employ our vast resources to best advantage rests--in large measure--on the skill and dedication of those principally responsible for our foreign relations.
Americans in foreign service carry the major burden of representing the American people and their interests abroad. They are subjected to physical hardships and at times to physical danger. As President, I am well aware of the sacrifices we demand of them, and of their families.
The Foreign Service may be proud of the manner in which it discharges its great responsibilities. I believe it fitting that we set aside this day to honor those who serve their country abroad. By so doing, we show our appreciation for their contribution to the security and well-being of our nation, and to the peace of the world.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
