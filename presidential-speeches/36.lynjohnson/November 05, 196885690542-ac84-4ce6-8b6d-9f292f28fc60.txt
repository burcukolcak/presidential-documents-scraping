Telegram to Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey.
[Released November 6, 1968. Dated November 5, 1968]
YOU have fought well and hard. You have carried your convictions and the standard of our party with eloquence and magnificent courage. In twenty years of national service, you have had no finer hours than those of the past few weeks--in which you awakened the support and interest of millions of our people.
As a fellow public servant, as a fellow Democrat, and as your friend of two decades, I am proud of you and the brave, enlightened, and vigorous campaign you have waged.
I know that you will continue to serve America and the cause of freedom for as long as you live.
With my admiration and deep affection for you and Muriel.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable Hubert Humphrey, Waverly, Minnesota]
