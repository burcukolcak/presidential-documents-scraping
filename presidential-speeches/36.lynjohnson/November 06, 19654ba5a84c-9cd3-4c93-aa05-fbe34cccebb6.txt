Proclamation 3686—Designating a Day of Dedication and Prayer for Those Risking Their Lives for Peace in Viet-Nam

Whereas, in assisting the people of South Viet-Nam to resist unprovoked aggression, the United States and other nations are carrying on the honored tradition of defending a people's right to freedom; and
Whereasthe purpose of the United States in Viet-Nam is to help to open the way for social justice in place of unprovoked aggression and peace instead of war; and
Whereasthere can be no social justice or economic progress without security from external attack and from terror in the night; and
Whereasthe Government of the United States remains ready without condition for the international discussions that can lead to lasting peace; and
Whereasit is the sense of the Congress in S. Res. 159 and H. Res. 626 that it would be fitting for the President to set aside a national day of remembrance dedicated to those Americans who are committing their lives, blood and energies in the defense of world peace.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Sunday, November 28, 1965, as a day of dedication and prayer, honoring the men and women of South Viet-Nam, of the United States, and of all other countries, who are risking their lives to bring about a just peace in South Viet-Nam.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this sixth day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.
