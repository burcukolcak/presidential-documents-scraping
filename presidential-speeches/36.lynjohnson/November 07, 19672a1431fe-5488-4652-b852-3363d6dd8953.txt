Statement by the President on the Development of a Multinational Program for Science and Technology in Latin America.
I URGED adoption of this program at Punta del Este, and am gratified that it is developing soundly. We continue to support the program and remain ready to join the Latin American countries in launching and funding these multinational efforts.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House release following a meeting between the President and Dr. James R. Killian, chairman of the corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Killian reported on his recent visit to Latin America to study the development of a multinational program for science and technology. He was serving at the request of the President as a member of the group of experts convened by the Presidents of the American States following their meeting at Punta del Este, Uruguay in April 1967 (see Items 176, 177).
