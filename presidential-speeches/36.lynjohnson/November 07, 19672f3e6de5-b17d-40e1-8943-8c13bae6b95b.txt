Statement by the President on the Death of John Nance Garner.
JOHN NANCE GARNER would have been 99 years old on the 22d of this month. Few are given so long a time, and fewer still have used their years to such advantage. Few men in history had more experience in government nor more respect from his colleagues during his long career in public service.
The Nation joins with the people of his beloved Uvalde in mourning the loss of one whose determination and joy of life were an inspiration to so many generations of Americans.
Note: Mr. Garner died at his home in Uvalde, Texas, on November 7, 1967. He served as Representative from Texas 1903-1933, Speaker of the House of Representatives 1931--1933, and Vice President of the United States 1933-1941.
