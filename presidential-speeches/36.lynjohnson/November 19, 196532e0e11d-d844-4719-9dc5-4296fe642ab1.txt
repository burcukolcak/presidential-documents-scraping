Statement by the President Upon Announcing the Recess Appointment of William Gotham as Assistant Secretary (for Program Coordination), HEW.
THE legislative successes of the 89th Congress have placed a heavy responsibility on the executive branch of Government. Good management is now the top priority concern of my administration.
That is why I asked Secretary Gardner and other department heads to take full advantage of the latest techniques in program planning and evaluation. And that is why I am appointing, on Secretary Gardner's recommendation, William Gorham to the new position of Assistant Secretary (for Program Coordination) in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
Mr. Gorham has exhibited unusual qualifications in this area. He is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and studied at the Graduate School of Economics at Stanford. He has served more recently as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower). Secretary McNamara tells me that he has been one of his ablest assistants. I believe this appointment will further strengthen Secretary Gardner's capacity to coordinate the wide range of programs for which his Department is responsible.
