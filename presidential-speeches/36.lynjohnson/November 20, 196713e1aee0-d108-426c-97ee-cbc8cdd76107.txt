Statement by the President on the Fourth Anniversary of the Death of John F. Kennedy.
IT IS now 4 years since the unbelievable tragedy of John Kennedy's death.
The men and women he inspired, the ideas he stimulated, advanced, and manifested in his own life, still strengthen the Republic.

John Kennedy's legacy to his Nation is one of courage in adversity; of tolerance in a time of passionate conviction; of steadfastness and loyalty in an hour of trial. Millions of Americans bear that legacy in their hearts today.
