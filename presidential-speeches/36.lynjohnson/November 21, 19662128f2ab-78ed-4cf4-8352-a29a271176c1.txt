Statement by the President on the Death of David L. Lawrence.
I MOURN the death of Governor David L. Lawrence. I mourn the passing of an able and dedicated public servant, and the loss of a personal friend and a trusted adviser.
David Lawrence's life was spent in the service of his fellow man. He brought skill and compassion to every task he undertook and every office he held.

--In Pittsburgh as mayor.

--In Pennsylvania as Governor.

--And in the Nation as the President's advocate and spokesman for fair housing practices.
A generation does not produce many such leaders as Governor Lawrence and with the passing of each goes something important in our national lives.
That is the void and the sense of loss we all feel with the death of a man who knew that politics has a high purpose, and that purpose is to improve the lives of our fellow citizens. David Lawrence served that purpose well.
Note: At the time of his death, Mr. Lawrence was serving as Special Assistant to the President and as Chairman of the President's Committee on Equal Opportunity in Housing.
