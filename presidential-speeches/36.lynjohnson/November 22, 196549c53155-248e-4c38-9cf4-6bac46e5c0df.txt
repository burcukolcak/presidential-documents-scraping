Remarks in Fredericksburg, Texas, at a Memorial Service Marking the Second Anniversary of President Kennedy's Assassination
No one of us who lived on that terrible November day will ever be able to forget what happened then or what we lost there.
The years will make more bearable the burden of grief we felt, but not even the passing of time will dim the memory of John F. Kennedy's life.
It is not for us to know how many great things he might have accomplished had he been spared the assassin's hand, but of this we are certain--he lived long enough, and well enough, to rekindle our spirit, to renew our faith, and to reaffirm our commitment as a people to all the great purposes for which this Nation was created.
Note: The President spoke at 12:15 p.m. in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Fredericksburg, Tex., before a gathering of 400 persons at a memorial service for President Kennedy.
Eulogies and prayers were delivered by the Reverend Dr. John Barclay, pastor of the Central Christian Church of Austin, the Right Reverend Joseph L. Manning, representative of the Catholic Archdiocese of Austin, and Rabbi Judah Fish, representative of the Jewish community of Austin. The text of their remarks is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 1, p. 525).
