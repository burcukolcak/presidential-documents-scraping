Memorandum Urging Continued Improvement of Programs in Aid of Small Business
Memorandum for Honorable Robert S. McNamara, Secretary of Defense; Honorable Glenn T. Seaborg, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission; Honorable Lawson B. Knott, Jr., Administrator, General Services Administration; Honorable James E. Webb, Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Small Business Administration representatives are about to be reinstalled in the procurement operations of each of your agencies. This should be a helpful step in improving the overall small business program.
I know how very hard you have worked to improve small business programs over the past several years. In fiscal year 1967, the combined small business awards made by your respective departments totaled $8.9 billion.
Like all excellent performances, continued improvement becomes increasingly difficult. Nevertheless, a prosperous small business community means a stronger national economy. I hope, therefore, you will accept the challenge and make the coming fiscal year the best yet for small business in terms of proportionate share in dollar awards.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
