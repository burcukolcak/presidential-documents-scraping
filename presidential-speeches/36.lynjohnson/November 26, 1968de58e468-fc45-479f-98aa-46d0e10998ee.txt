Statement by the President on the Decision by the Republic of Vietnam To Participate in the Peace Talks in Paris.
ALONG with the other fighting allies in Vietnam, we welcome the announcement of the Government of the Republic of Vietnam that it will be shortly sending a delegation to Paris to join in the search for peace.
This step opens a new and hopeful phase in the negotiations; but, as I have said before, we must expect both hard bargaining and hard fighting in the days ahead.
Note: The statement was released at San Antonio, Texas.
