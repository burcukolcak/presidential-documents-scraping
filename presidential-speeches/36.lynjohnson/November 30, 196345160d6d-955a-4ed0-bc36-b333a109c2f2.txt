Lyndon B. Johnson
November 30, 1963

Statement by the President on the District of Columbia.
AS ONE who has lived in the District of Columbia for over 30 years, I have a deep and continuing interest in the unique and difficult problems faced by the Government of the District of Columbia and by the people who live here. The unusual interest in the affairs of the District evidenced by both President and Mrs. Kennedy are, of course, well known to citizens of the District, not only in terms of the need for improved welfare, educational, employment, and other community programs, but also in Washington as the Nation's Capital.
I have met with Mr. Charles Horsky, the Advisor on National Capital Affairs, and have asked him to remain in his position and to continue to keep me advised personally of the many matters of special concern to the District of Columbia and to the areas adjoining the District which comprise the National Capital Area.
I believe that this Capital City is entitled to the benefits of self-government so its citizens can have a full voice in their own affairs. It is the policy of this administration to seek adequate measures of leadership for the District, and to recommend and support necessary legislation and budgetary requests to the end that Washington will be an example for the world of which our country can be proud.
A great Nation deserves--indeed, requires--a beautiful and inspiring National Capital. We shall do everything possible to achieve this goal.
