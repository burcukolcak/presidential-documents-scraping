Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Increasing War Orphans' Educational Assistance Allowances.
I HAVE SIGNED a bill which will provide an increase in the rates of war orphans' educational assistance allowances to some 20,000 deserving sons and daughters of veterans who lost their lives, or were totally and permanently disabled, defending our freedom around the world. This bill will also liberalize the eligibility requirements so as to provide benefits for all children whose veteran-parent was killed, or permanently and totally disabled, as a result of service after the end of the Korean conflict.
This is the first rate increase afforded under the War Orphans' Educational Assistance Act since it was enacted in 1956. This amendment will increase the monthly allowance payable to those who are presently pursuing education under the program, or who will do so later, from $110 to $130 per month for full-time educational training.
It is fair and right that this rate adjustment, and liberalized eligibility criteria, should be provided. Our obligation to these children is clear. I am proud to sign this bill into law.
Note: As enacted, the bill (H.R. 205) is Public Law 89--222 (79 Stat. 896). It was approved on September 30, 1965.
