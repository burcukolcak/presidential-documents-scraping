Letter Authorizing the Secretary, HEW, To Undertake a Joint United States-Japan Medical Research Program.
Dear Mr. Secretary .
Pursuant to the authority vested in the President by section 5(f) of the International Health Research Act of 1960 (PL 86-610), you are authorized to undertake a joint United States-Japan medical research program. This program, designed to pool the knowledge and resources of the two countries in fighting major diseases affecting the people of Asia, results from the discussions which I had with Prime Minister Sato in January. It is known as the United States Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program.
The program responsibility assigned to you hereby will be administered within the limits of foreign policy as prescribed by the Secretary of State.
I am pleased with this opportunity for the United States to participate with Japan in the joint solution of health problems which will have worldwide benefits.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable John W. Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Washington, D.C. 20201 ]
Note: On the same day the White House announced the beginning of the program. The release stated that, following the President's discussions with Prime Minister Sato in January 1965, initial plans for the program were made at a preliminary meeting of United States and Japanese scientists in April. A Committee for the United States-Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program was to meet in October, the release stated, and annually thereafter. The Committee planned to use panels of scientific experts from both countries in research efforts to control or eradicate cholera, tuberculosis, leprosy, certain virus and parasitic diseases, and malnutrition (1 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs., p. 355).
For the joint statement of the President and Prime Minister Sato following their discussions in January 1965, see Item 15.
