Statement by the President on Asking for a Report on the Economic Condition of the Textile and Apparel Industries.
I HAVE today asked the United States Tariff Commission to report to me by January 15, 1968, in the fullest detail possible on the economic condition of the United States textile and apparel industries. In this report, I expect in particular an intensive analysis of the present and prospective impact of imports upon these industries.
This administration has consistently acted in recognition of the fact that the textile and apparel industries are of great importance to our economy. In recent months representatives of these industries have expressed to me and to many others a deep concern over their future well-being in light of a number of factors, and especially import trends. A large number of the Members of the Congress in both the House and Senate--including Chairman Mills of the Ways and Means Committee--have sponsored bills which deal with the question of imports.
In considering this widespread concern, I have concluded that we must have all the facts possible to guide our future actions in this important field, and I am pleased that Chairman Mills is joining my request. I hope that the Tariff Commission's report will permit all of us who are deeply interested in the welfare of the textile and apparel industries to take a course of action which will be both in their interest and the national interest.
Note: The report is entitled "Textiles and Apparel: Report to the President on Investigation No. 332-55 Under Section 332 of the Tariff Act of 1930" (2 vols., TC Publication 226). It was received by the President on January 15, 1968.
