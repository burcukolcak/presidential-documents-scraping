Message to the Congress Transmitting Second Annual Report on Special International Exhibitions.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting the Second Annual Report on Special International Exhibitions, for the fiscal year 1964, pursuant to section 108(b) of Public Law 87-256, the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961.
This program is designed to reveal to peoples abroad the true nature and broad extent of our economic, social, and cultural attainments. These exhibitions are also designed to advance mutually profitable trade relationships.
This American know-how is presented to show how it harmonizes with the host country's own aspirations and capabilities. This is done by presenting major U.S. exhibitions at selected international fairs and expositions, or as special events, in support of American foreign-policy objectives.
This program concentrates mainly in Eastern Europe and the developing countries. Hundreds of American business and industrial firms, private institutions, and individuals cooperated with government agencies and contributed materials, time, and talent to help insure the success of these exhibitions.
For people who yearn to learn more about us, the American pavilion is like a large picture window through which they can look and see for themselves. The steady stream of young and old, from all walks of life, flocking to our exhibitions to improve their knowledge of what America is and means is a sight not easily forgotten.
These exhibitions are a vital adjunct to our country's unceasing pursuit of peace, freedom and human dignity for men everywhere. I am gratified by the support the Congress has given this program since it began a decade ago.
