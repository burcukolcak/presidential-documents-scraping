Statement by the President at the Beginning of a Campaign Trip.
THE OFFICE of President is the office of all the people. As have the other 35 men who have held this trust, I am leaving today to report to the people in person on the stewardship of their office.
I look forward to this experience with zest and enthusiasm. There is nowhere I would rather be than out with the American people.
I believe there is a strong tide running in America today. It is a tide of support for responsibility--and that tide is gathering strength.
Our long and patient efforts under administrations of both Democratic and Republican Parties are bearing fruit at home and in the world.
This administration is the first in history not to experience a recession or depression.
This administration is the first since World War II under which no nation has fallen to the control of communism.
Our efforts toward a better life at home-and for support of freedom in the world--are succeeding. Our gains are much too great to gamble on partisanship for partisanship's sake alone. Our progressiveness and prudence have brought us to this summit of success and the American people have no desire to turn from the path of prudent progress this year.
It is my hope that the campaign will be kept on a plane worthy of the Presidency. What two men say about each other matters very little when the freedom, prosperity, and peace of 190 million people are at stake.
