Statement by the President on the Death of Clement Attlee
I HAVE learned with deep sorrow of the death of Lord Attlee, one of the great leaders of the United Kingdom. His passing is a loss not only to his own countrymen, but to all men moved by democratic ideals and the spirit of freedom.
In a career of great distinction he devoted his life to his country's service. As Deputy Prime Minister in the wartime national government he powerfully contributed to the winning of the war. Afterwards, as Prime Minister of the postwar government, he made memorable contributions to the difficult task of reconstruction. When new perils required not only rebuilding, but rearming as well, he did not flinch at the prospect or at the sacrifices entailed. He was one of the pillars of the Western alliance.
Lord Attlee was a strong defender and champion of democracy and freedom. As a political leader and a creative humanitarian, he earned the admiration and respect of the entire world.
We join in paying homage to a British statesman who was also a warm and valued friend of the United States. To his family, and to the British people, we extend our sympathy and condolences.
