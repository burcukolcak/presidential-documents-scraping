Lyndon B. Johnson
October 11, 1968

Statement by the President on the Gun Control Bill.
YESTERDAY the Congress adopted most of my recommendations for a comprehensive gun control law. I am glad that the public will now be protected against the indiscriminate mail-order sales of rifles, shotguns, pistols, and ammunition.
I am sorry, however, that Congress did not adopt two important recommendations--to require the registration of guns and the licensing of gunowners. In a nation with over 160 million guns--almost four times as many firearms as families--registration and licensing would have brought far greater protection to the people. But the voices of the gun lobby prevailed for the moment and these safeguards were defeated.
So now we must and will continue to work toward the day when these elementary safeguards--long adopted by other civilized nations of the world--become the law of our land. I hope the good people of America will help us in this continued effort.
Note: The Gun Control Act of 1968 was approved on October 22, 1968 (see Item 553).
