UNITED STATES ARMY
The foregoing units of the United States Army distinguished themselves by gallantry in action while engaged in military operations against a hostile force on 19-22 June 1966 at Trung Luong, Republic of Vietnam. During Operations "Deckhouse II" and "Nathan Hale", the 2d Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry and 1st Battalion (Airborne), 8th Cavalry, displayed gallantry and esprit de corps in defeating a well-disciplined, heavily armed and numerically superior enemy force. Operation "Deckhouse II" began on 19 June 1966 with a two-pronged, two-company airmobile assault south of Trung Luong conducted by Companies A and C, 2d Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry. As Companies A and C swept north, they encountered resistance from small enemy units armed with automatic weapons and repelled them without casualties. As Company C approached the village from the west, it was opposed fiercely by 2 platoons from the elite 18B North Vietnamese Army Regiment. On the morning of 20 June 1966, Companies A and C launched attacks to the north. The battle raged for hours with the enemy using antiaircraft weapons in direct fire at point-blank range. Company B, recalled from other brigade operations, took casualties as they debarked the helicopters, but they immediately attacked the hill under cover of artillery fire. In actions bristling with individual deeds of extraordinary heroism, Companies A and B fought through the afternoon until nearly dark, when they withdrew to evacuate their wounded. At 1915 hours on 20 June 1966, Companies B and C were helilifted into a landing zone to the north. At this time the operation was redesignated "Nathan Hale". On the morning of 21 June 1966, Companies B and C, 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry, delivered covering fire from the north while Company B, 2d Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry, executed another assault on Hill 258. This determined assault and sweep operation neutralized the enemy force and Hill 258 was secured. Company B, 2d Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry, consolidated the objective while Companies B and C, 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry, moved south and southeast on two axes to link up with and reinforce Companies A and C, 2d Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry, respectively. Company C, 2d Battalion (Airborne), also launched a determined attack on the enemy on 21 June 1966. Company B, 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry, made contact with Company C and closed in to their perimeter after an all-day foot movement from Hill 258. At 0430 hours on 22 June 1966, the enemy launched the most ferocious attack of the four-day battle. After three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was finally forced to withdraw under intense fire with extremely heavy losses. At 0900 hours on the morning of 22 June 1966, Company A, 2d Battalion, 327th Infantry and Company C, 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry, conducted an assault, seizing high ground to the south of Trung Luong. By 1615 hours these companies were in full possession of the key terrain. 23 June 1966 ended one of the longest and most fiercely waged engagements of the Vietnam War. The enemy lost 373 personnel by body count and estimate, along with 70 individual and 9 crew-served weapons. By comparison, the friendly forces lost 26 killed in action while 3 died of wounds. Throughout the four-day battle, the gallantry and indomitable spirit with which the 2d Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry, and the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry, engaged and destroyed the well prepared heavily armed and numerically superior enemy force were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on all members of the Battalions who participated in this combat action.
