CITATION TO ACCOMPANY

THE AWARD OF
THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION
TO THE 12TH AIR COMMANDO SQUADRON
The 12th Air Commando Squadron, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force while conducting defoliation missions throughout the Republic of Vietnam, from 21 August 1966 to 30 June 1967. During this period, members of the 12th Air Commando Squadron repeatedly encountered extremely heavily defended target complexes while flying at a very low altitude and airspeed required for successful accomplishment of proper defoliation. Despite the constant personal danger inherent in the performance of their vital mission, these men defoliated over 1,200,000 acres of jungle canopy which concealed hostile forces. The subsequent and continuing ground and air operations in the defoliated areas have been aided immeasurably by the accomplishments of these men. Their esprit de corps, great heroism, and devotion to duty in the performance of this hazardous mission typify the noblest traditions of the military profession. By their extraordinary courage, superb airmanship, and aggressiveness in the face of hostile forces, the members of the 12th Air Commando Squadron have reflected the highest credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.
