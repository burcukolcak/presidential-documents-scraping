Executive Order 11253â€”Amending Executive Order No. 11157 as it Relates to Incentive Pay for Hazardous Duty
By virtue of the authority vested in me by Sections 301 (a) and (f) of Title 37 of the United States Code and as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, Section 106 of Executive Order No. 11157 of June 22, 1964, is hereby amended by inserting "(a)" immediately after "Sec. 106.", and by adding at the end thereof the following new subsection:
"(b) As determined by the Secretary of the Navy, any member qualified in submarines who, pursuant to competent orders, is assigned as a member of a submarine operational command staff whose duties require serving on a submarine during underway operations and who
(1) during one calendar month, so serves 48 hours,
(2) during any two consecutive calendar months when the requirements of clause (1) above have not been met, so serves 96 hours, or
(3) during any three consecutive calendar months when the requirements of clause (2) above have not been met, so serves 144 hours,
shall be entitled to receive incentive pay for the performance of submarine duty. In computing the incentive pay of members of a submarine operational command staff under this subsection
(1) for fractions of a calendar month, the time required to be served during underway operations shall bear the same ratio to the time required for a full calendar month as the period in question bears to a full calendar month, and
(2) for fractions of two consecutive calendar months, the period in question shall be considered as a unit and the time required shall bear the same ratio to the time required for a full calendar month as the period in question bears to a full calendar month."
