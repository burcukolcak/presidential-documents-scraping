Statement by the President Urging the Sending of Holiday Gifts and Messages to Servicemen in Viet-Nam and Southeast Asia.
THE COMMITMENT of U.S. personnel in Viet-Nam and Southeast Asia means that thousands of our countrymen will be spending Christmas halfway around the world in an atmosphere far removed from the warm friendliness and good cheer of a typical holiday at home. More than ever, it is important that we remember our friends and loved ones who so valiantly serve us overseas.
With the expected steep increase in the volume of this year's Christmas mall for Americans in Southeast Asia, I am informed that the Post Office Department is tripling the amount of space in the San Francisco Post Office devoted to handling this mail. There will be an addition of nearly 200 postal workers between now and mid-December to make sure that gift packages and greetings are delivered by Christmas Eve. All packages sent with regular surface postage should be mailed by November 10. Airmail packages, letters, and cards should be sent no later than December 1.
I encourage all Americans to especially remember our servicemen in Viet-Nam and Southeast Asia during the holiday season. Although they may be separated from the warmth of the family fireside, we can assure them, through our gifts and messages, that they are here in our hearts.
