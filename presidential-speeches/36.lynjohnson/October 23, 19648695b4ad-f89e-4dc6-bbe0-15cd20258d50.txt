Recorded Remarks Congratulating the U.S. Olympic Team and the Members of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
I WANT to extend the congratulations of all your fellow Americans for the championship performance and the sportsmanlike spirit of our U.S. competitors at the 1964 Olympics.
We are all proud of the record that you have made and the way in which you have served as ambassadors of good will for our country. You have made clear the vigor and the fair play that best represent our own national character. You and the athletes from other nations have provided heartening testimony that common ground can be found among the people of this earth, and that genuine fellowship is attainable.
Healthy competition can be a spur to bring out the best in all of us, and international understanding that leads to peace is possible even in the presently troubled world.
We are proud of you, and gratified for the example that you have set. As soon as the team members return, I will invite all of the winners of medals in this year's games to join me here for lunch at the White House in the Capital City so that I can personally express to them the happiness of a proud and grateful nation.
Note: The President's remarks were video-taped in the Theater at the White House. For his remarks at the luncheon for the medal winners see Item 782.
