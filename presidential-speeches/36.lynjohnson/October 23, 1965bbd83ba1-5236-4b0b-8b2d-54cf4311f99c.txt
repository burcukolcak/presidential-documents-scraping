Statement by the President Designating Two Peaks of Mount McKinley in Honor of Sir Winston Churchill.
IT IS FITTING that these majestic peaks be named in Sir Winston Churchill's honor. Soldier, author, statesman, he was one of the greatest leaders in the history of English-speaking peoples, and he devoted his life to the twin goals of peace and freedom. Sir Winston was an honorary American citizen--the second man in history to be so honored by the people of the United States.
Note: The statement was made public as part of a White House release announcing that the President had designated the north and south peaks of Mount McKinley as Churchill Peaks. The release stated that designation of the peaks of the 20,300-foot mountain in Alaska was proposed by Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall and the National Park Service, custodian of Mount McKinley National Park, a 3,030-square-mile subarctic wilderness area.
