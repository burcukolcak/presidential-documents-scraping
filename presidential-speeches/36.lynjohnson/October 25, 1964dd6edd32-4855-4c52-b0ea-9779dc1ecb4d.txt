Lyndon B. Johnson
October 25, 1964

Statement by the President Announcing a Series of Statements on Economic Issues.
GREAT ISSUES lie before the country for decision. The supreme issues of life and death are in the field of foreign policy--as Red China's bomb and the changes in Moscow so forcibly remind us.
But the strength that underlies our world leadership is anchored in the prosperity and stability of the American economy. Our 4-year record of strong and balanced economic advance knows no parallel in this or any other country. Maintaining this great prosperity is a vital task that challenges our free society.
So the American people have every right to do more than just "look at the record." They have every right to ask where I stand on the key economic issues that will determine the health and growth of our economy.
In a series of brief White House statements over the next few days, I will outline my position on some of the most important economic issues before the country today. I shall deal with the following topics:
1. Maintaining Prosperity

2. Monetary Policy for Stability and Growth

3. Strengthening Our Balance of Payments

4. Responsible and Effective Fiscal Policy

5. Further Tax Reduction

6. Strengthening State-Local Government

7. Improving the Tax System

8. Expanding World Trade

9. Promoting Responsible Price-Wage Decisions

10. Achieving Full Employment
Note: For the individual statements on the 10 topics, see Items 708, 714, 722-724, 730, 731, 739, 740, and 743.
