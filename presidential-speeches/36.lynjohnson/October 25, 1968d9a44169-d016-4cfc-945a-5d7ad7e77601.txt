Lyndon B. Johnson
October 25, 1968

Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Implementing Certain International Customs Conventions.
WITH THE signing of this bill, we build a stronger foundation for the flow of commerce among nations. The legislation I have just signed will allow America to join five international customs conventions.

These conventions will simplify and streamline customs procedures. They will eliminate unnecessary formalities. This will help our foreign trade:

--by making it easier for American firms to bring commercial samples into foreign markets;

--by allowing Americans to take professional equipment abroad, duty free, for up to 6 months; this will be of particular help to the press, broadcasting, and motion picture industries;

--by facilitating the use of shipping containers in international trade. Our Nation has pioneered this highly efficient and rapidly growing form of transportation and we gain from measures that extend its use.
These conventions represent solid progress. Yet the work of international economic cooperation often goes unnoticed. For three decades America has steered the course of trade expansion. We must continue on that course.
Note: As enacted, the bill (H.R. 18373), approved on October 24, 1968, is Public Law 90-635 (82 Stat. 1351).
