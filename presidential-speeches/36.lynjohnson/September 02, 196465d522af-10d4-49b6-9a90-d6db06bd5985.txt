Statement by the President on the Death of Sergeant York.
SERGEANT Alvin Cullum York has stood as a symbol of American courage and sacrifice for almost half a century. His valor, above and beyond the call of duty, in World War I was recognized with the Nation's highest award, the Medal of Honor. As the citizen-soldier hero of the American Expeditionary Forces, he epitomized the gallantry of American fighting men and their sacrifices in behalf of freedom.
As Commander in Chief, I know that I express the deep and heartfelt sympathy of the American people to his wife and family.
