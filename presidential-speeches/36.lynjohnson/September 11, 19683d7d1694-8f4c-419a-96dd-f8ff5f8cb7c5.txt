Letter to Presidential Candidates Concerning Plans for an Orderly Transfer of Executive Power.
Dear_______________:

In accordance with the purpose of the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, I wish to take all reasonable steps to promote the orderly transfer of the Executive power in connection with the inauguration of a new President on January 20, 1969. To this end, I am asking Executive departments and agencies to make plans to facilitate an orderly transition.
I have designated Charles S. Murphy as the central coordinator in the White House Office to assist me in transition matters. There are a number of these matters as to which planning prior to the election will be useful. I will be glad for you to designate someone at this time, if you wish, as your representative to work with Mr. Murphy on matters relating to the transition. Additional steps can be taken later as the circumstances warrant.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
