Memorandum to Federal Agencies on Voluntary Blood Donations
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
In recent times we have made great progress through the enlightened legislation passed by Congress to provide better health and medical programs for the American people. In this we are waging a relentless fight on many of the nation's health problems such as cancer and heart disease.
One of the essential elements in the practice of modern medicine is the continuing availability of whole blood and blood derivatives in adequate amounts throughout the nation. I, therefore, urge all Federal employees to fulfill their citizenship responsibility by serving as voluntary blood donors through their Red Cross blood centers and community blood banks. In this way, they will be materially assisting the crusade for better health and medical care for the nation.
I will appreciate your personal cooperation by urging continuing participation of your department personnel wherever assigned.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
