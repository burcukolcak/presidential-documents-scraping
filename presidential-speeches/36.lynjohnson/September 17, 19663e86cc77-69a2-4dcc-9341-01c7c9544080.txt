Statement by the President on the Death of James H. Moyers.
THE DEATH of James Moyers at 39 is a tragedy to his family and a grievous loss to me and his colleagues in the White House.
He came to us from private industry only a year ago to serve as Assistant to the President. In that time the White House knew no one more conscientious or more devoted to the work of the Presidency. Jim Moyers was a faithful public servant and a treasured friend.
Mrs. Johnson and I grieve with Rutha Moyers and their children, Melinda and Karen. May time heal this loss of their husband and father, and the Lord give them strength in the days to come.
