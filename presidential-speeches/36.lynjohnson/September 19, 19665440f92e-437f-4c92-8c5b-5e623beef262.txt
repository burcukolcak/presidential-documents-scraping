Telegram to the President of Mexico on the Lower Rio Grande Salinity Problem.
ONCE AGAIN I have the pleasure to inform you of the enactment and approval of legislation of great interest to both our countries. You will recall you joined with me last December in announcing the recommendations of the International Boundary and Water Commission for a solution of the salinity problem on the lower Rio Grande. The United States Congress has quickly approved these recommendations by passing legislation to authorize the proposed international project.
I believe that the Commission is to be congratulated on having arrived at so equitable and satisfactory a solution. This project, now to be undertaken jointly by our two Governments, is still another notable achievement in our cooperative efforts to resolve common border problems.
Mrs. Johnson and I send our warmest regards to you and Mrs. Diaz Ordaz.
Accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[His Excellency Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, President of the United Mexican States]
Note: For a statement by the President upon signing the legislation, see Item 467.
