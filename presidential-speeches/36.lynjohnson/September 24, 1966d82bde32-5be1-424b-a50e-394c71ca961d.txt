Lyndon B. Johnson
September 24, 1966

Statement by the President on the Fifth Anniversary of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act.
FIVE YEARS AGO Monday, the Congress passed and the President approved the United States Arms Control Act, because the people of this Nation felt that the most urgent goal of national policy was to build a peaceful world environment.
When the United States was the only nation possessing atomic weapons, we urged others to join us in placing all atomic facilities under international control. Now five nations possess nuclear weapons.
We are still seeking and urging the effective international control of atomic facilities and weapons.
The highest priority goal of national policy continues to be: - to lift from mankind the threat of nuclear war.
This means we must continue to seek and gain agreements that would bring the nuclear arms race under control and prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons.
In observing this fifth anniversary of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, I, as President of the United States, pledge this Government to continue the search for peace, on every front, whatever the obstacles we may confront--however long the road may be.
