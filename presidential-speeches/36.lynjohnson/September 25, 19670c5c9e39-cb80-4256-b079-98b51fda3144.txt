Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to the Congress the annual report of the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation for the year ending December 31, 1966.
After eight years of operation the Seaway is playing a major role in our national and international transportation network. The gains registered in 1966 are noteworthy:

--Traffic in wheat increased from 8.6 million cargo tons in 1965 to 11.2 million tons in 1966.

--Traffic in iron ore rose from 12.8 million tons in 1965 to 15.5 million tons in 1966.
--In total, more than 49 million tons of cargo passed through the Seaway, an increase of nearly 6 million tons over 1965.

--Revenue from this traffic was a record $7. 1 million.

--For the first time in its history, the Seaway was not required to defer any portion of its annual interest payment. It returned to the United States Treasury $5.2 million to repay current and deferred interest.
This report contains a catalogue of successes. But it reveals as well an unfortunate deficiency in the Seaway's construction. The concrete of the Eisenhower Lock is rapidly deteriorating.
We cannot allow this situation to persist. Ships must not be delayed. The flow of cargo must not be interrupted. Three bills introduced this session--S. 2131, H.R. 11826, and H.R. 11871--would provide the funds necessary to repair the lock.
I urge your prompt and favorable consideration of these measures, and I commend this report to your attention.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
