Lyndon B. Johnson
September 30, 1965

Statement by the President in Response to Report on the Federal Incentive Awards Program.
THIS unparalleled record of cost consciousness and alertness to improvement on the part of our career civil servants deserves the heartiest plaudits of the American people. Each individual, each supervisor, each manager who contributed to this record has my gratitude.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House release giving highlights from a report by John W. Macy, Jr., Chairman of the Civil Service Commission. The release stated that 133,449 Federal employee suggestions had been adopted during fiscal year 1965, resulting in Government savings of more than $95 million, the greatest dollar savings ever achieved. Awards to employees for adopted suggestions, the release noted, had set a record at $3.9 million, with an additional 67,099 employees receiving superior performance awards for work achievements which returned more than $150 million in benefits to the Government. These employees shared $8.7 million in awards, with the average award amounting to $145 (1 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs., p. 335).
