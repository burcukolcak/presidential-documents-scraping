Letter to Governors Urging Their Cooperation in the Observance of Earth Week.
IN A special message to the Congress on February 8, I proposed a series of measures whose prompt adoption will provide a cleaner, healthier environment for every living being. Apart from a number of specific proposals for legislation, the message emphasized the need for enlisting active participation in this effort by all of our fellow Americans.
I have proclaimed the week beginning April 18 as Earth Week, and I ask for your cooperation in making this period a time when all of us work together to clean up the nation. Because a better environment depends ultimately on the wishes of a citizenry deeply concerned and fully informed about the choices before us, the critical role of our system of education cannot be overemphasized. The difficult decisions before us must be wise ones, and I hope that Earth Week will see educational institutions of all levels considering ways in which the learning process can best foster understanding of environmental needs and opportunities, for the challenges of the future clearly require that each and every week be Earth Week so that we may achieve the quality of life we seek. With best personal regards, Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
