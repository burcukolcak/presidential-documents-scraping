Letter to the Chairman, Civil Aeronautics Board, on the Transpacific Route Investigation.
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I have concluded my review of the international phase of the Transpacific Route Investigation (your Docket 16242). Based upon considerations of foreign relations and national security, I have concluded that the international route structure which was tentatively established by President Johnson last December must be modified as follows:
(1) Awards of Great Circle routes to the Orient from California points are not approved.
(2) Pan American's authorization to provide service from the Pacific Northwest to the Orient over a Great Circle route is not approved.
(3) The second carrier route to the South Pacific should bypass the California gateway. On this aspect of the case, I ask the Board to recommend a carrier to serve U.S. East Coast and Midwest coterminal points.
(4) The new American Samoa-Okinawa route segment should be deferred, and considered by the Board in the pending Pacific Islands Local Service Investigation.
(5) The award to Hawaii via Mexico to carry stopover passengers is disapproved.
(6) The use of so-called satellite airports in this case appears unwise and should not be required.
Otherwise, President Johnson's decision of last December is approved.
I desire the Board to submit immediately for my approval an order effectuating these conclusions.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[The Honorable John H. Crooker, Jr., Chairman, Civil Aeronautics Board, Washington, D.C.]
Note: In a news briefing on April 24, Presidential Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler announced that the President had received and approved a Civil Aeronautics Board order drafted in compliance with his request in the last paragraph of the above letter.
