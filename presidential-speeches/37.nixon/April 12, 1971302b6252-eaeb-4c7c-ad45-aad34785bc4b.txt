Statement Announcing Plans for a White House Conference on the Future of the American Business System
WE MUST become the managers of change. The private enterprise system is facing new challenges on every front. Corporations are being called upon increasingly to help provide solutions to complex national, social, and economic problems. Business, labor, and government must work in partnership for the public good.
Plans must be made now to make the most of the opportunities ahead. I feel it is time for key leaders with an interest in our industrial society to take a long range look and develop policies that will help shape that future. It is for .this reason that I am calling this White House Conference.
Note: The statement was made available as part of a White House release announcing the President's call for a White House Conference on "The Industrial World Ahead: A Look at Business in 1990," to be held in Washington, D.C., November 8-10, 1971.
The release noted that the Conference, chaired by Secretary of Commerce Maurice H. Stans and Secretary of Labor James D. Hodgson, would have four major themes: The Structure of the Private Enterprise System, Jobs Ahead, Technology and Resources for Business, and The Social Responsibility of Business. Each theme would provide a focal point for assessment of the challenges faced by American business, and attempts would be made to present suggestions for policy development to meet those challenges.
