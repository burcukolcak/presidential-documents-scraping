Statement About a Proposal for Internment of Prisoners of War in a Neutral Country
I WELCOME the Republic of Vietnam's proposal, made on April 8 in the Paris negotiations, for internment of prisoners of war in a neutral country. Although short of the release of prisoners of war which is our goal, this would be a reasonable and responsible way of alleviating the plight of prisoners of war on both sides. I hope the other side will respond positively to this initiative.
Third country internment of prisoners of war is specifically envisaged by the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention of 1949, by which both sides in the Indochina conflict are bound. There can be no constructive purpose in the continued long detention of prisoners of war. They and their families have suffered too much already. Agreement to intern prisoners of war in a third country would mean that the prisoners would no longer serve as hostages for political or military purposes.
Note: On May 3, 1971, during a news briefing at the Western White House, San Clemente, Calif., White House Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler read the following statement on the Swedish Government's offer of assistance in the prisoner of war matter:
President Nixon today noted with great satisfaction that according to press reports the Government of Sweden has offered the use of its vessels and its territory to provide internment of prisoners of war from the conflict in Vietnam. The President would hope that Hanoi will move promptly to negotiate an agreement on this issue to take advantage of this humanitarian offer on the part of the Swedish Government.
