Letter of Congratulations to President Zalman Shazar on the 21st Anniversary of the State of Israel.
Dear Mr. President:
My warmest congratulations go out to you and your people on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary of the State of Israel.
As so many of my fellow Americans, I deeply admire the accomplishments your country has realized in the course of its young life. Adversity has been your challenge as you have pressed forward in the face of overwhelming odds toward progress and well-being for your citizens.
But as so many peace-loving men and women throughout the world, I, too, am deeply disturbed and saddened by the conflict that has marred the great success you have attained.
So on this anniversary, as I share your satisfaction in the continuing achievements of your nation, I also join with you--and with all men of goodwill---in the fervent hope that peace may soon accompany the prosperity you enjoy.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[His Excellency Zalman Shazar, President of Israel]
