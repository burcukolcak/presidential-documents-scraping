Statement on the Death of President Franz Jonas of Austria.
WITH the death of President Franz Jonas, Austria has lost one of her great postwar leaders, Europe has lost one of her foremost statesmen, and the cause of world peace has lost a courageous defender.
The people of the United States join me in extending our deepest sympathy to the people of Austria.
Note: President Jonas, 74, was President of Austria from 1965 until his death in Vienna, Austria.
James Roosevelt served as Personal Representative of the President and head of the U.S. delegation at funeral services in Vienna on April 29, 1974. Members of the delegation also included Representative Guy A. Vander Jagt of Michigan; John P. Humes, United States Ambassador to Austria; Hobart D. Lewis, executive director and president of Reader's Digest; and John Safer of Washington, D.C.
