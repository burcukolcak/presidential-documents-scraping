Message About the Observance of National Invest-in-America Week.
NATIONAL Invest-in-America Week affords us all a time to ponder the realities behind the great success of the American economic system. It is a system whose growth has always depended upon the enterprise of individuals who took risks-investors. The fruits of their activities over the past 200 years are plain to see. In less than a year, our gross national product will reach a trillion dollars.
The need for investment in America is by no means ended. Although our capacity and our product far exceed that of any other nation, our national needs and national goals have also grown apace. Although public policy has an important role in the meeting of these goals, without private enterprise the goals themselves would be meaningless. For we depend upon private investment to provide us the capital to produce goods, to provide jobs, to build houses, to support the nation's public debt, and, most important, to maintain the growth of product and income that yields benefits for all Americans. In short, without the private investor, America would simply not be the country we know and love.
The future holds many challenges, both for public policy and for the private investor. But, in the great tradition of this Nation, I am sure that history will record that both were equal to the task.
