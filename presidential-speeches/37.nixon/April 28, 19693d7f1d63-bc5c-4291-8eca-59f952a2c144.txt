Letter to General Charles de Gaulle on the Announcement of His Resignation as President of France.
Dear Mr. President:
It is with deep regret that I have learned of your resignation as President of France. I have greatly valued the frank and comprehensive exchanges of views it has been my privilege to have with you, both as a private citizen and as Vice President and President of the United States. Nor shall I forget the courtesy of your welcome and the wisdom of your counsel during my recent visit to Paris. Our talks proved the occasion for a new departure in friendly cooperation between our two nations.
We in the United States will not forget what you have done for France, both at home and abroad, and for the world, both in war and in peace.
Mrs. Nixon joins me in sending you and Madame de Gaulle our warm personal regards and best wishes for the future.
RICHARD NIXON
[His Excellency Charles de Gaulle, President of the French Republic]
