Statement on Signing Executive Order Establishing the National Business Council for Consumer Affairs.
IN RECENT months I have been gratified by the increasing desire of the business community to take a more active role in meeting the concerns of the American consumer. These businessmen recognize that the concerns are widespread and often spring from valid complaints. They also share my belief that neither the Government nor the consumer movement can alone solve these problems, but that we must also rely upon the traditional goodwill and sound practices of the business community.
Because of this growing interest, I have today signed an Executive order [11614] creating the National Business Council for Consumer Affairs and have called upon a number of leaders from the business community to serve as its members. The wholehearted response of these distinguished businessmen and women to join with us in this effort is an indication of the resolve of American business to take a leading role in assuring equity in the marketplace.
The Council will allow businessmen to communicate regularly with the President, the Office of Consumer Affairs, the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department, other Government agencies as appropriate, and private organizations which are directly concerned with consumer affairs. This dialogue, in a forum involving all consumer product and service industries, will provide greater awareness and sensitivity for both consumer concerns and responsive corporate action.
I am pleased that Mr. Robert E. Brooker and Mr. Donald S. Perkins have agreed to serve as Chairman and Vice Chairman, respectively, of the National Business Council for Consumer Affairs.
