Remarks in Nashua, New Hampshire.
Mr. Mayor, ladies and gentlemen:
I want to tell you how much Mrs. Nixon and I appreciate this very warm welcome that you have given to us in Nashua on this beautiful day.
I was just telling the mayor that despite my many visits to New Hampshire, most of which have been political in the past-this, of course, is nonpolitical, as you know--in any event, on previous visits I have come to Nashua perhaps four or five times.
This is the first time I have ever seen the city in the daytime. I want to tell you what I told the mayor: It is a beautiful city. The streets are clean. The people are up-beat. I like Nashua, and I know you like Nashua, and I am glad to be here with you all.
Incidentally, when I saw this crowd I thought there was a little mistake. I thought you were expecting Greg Landry, or somebody like that.
But we do want you to know that we have so many pleasant memories of our visits to New Hampshire through the years. Most of all, whether you happen to be Republican or Democrat or Independent, I can assure you that for the President of the United States to come to one of the great States of the Union, to come to this beautiful city, with all of the American flags flying and I saw them along the road--it makes you realize that this is truly a very great country, with people who differ on many things, but who have respect for this country, respect for the office of the Presidency, and who are going to make it a more beautiful country in the years ahead.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke shortly after 3 p.m. at the city hall.
Dennis Sullivan was mayor of Nashua.
