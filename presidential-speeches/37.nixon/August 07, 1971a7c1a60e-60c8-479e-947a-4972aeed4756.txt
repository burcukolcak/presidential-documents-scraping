Statement Following Splashdown of Apollo 15.
APOLLO 15 has returned safely to earth.
It brings with it new proof of man's invincible will to master the moment of his own destiny. It brings new tribute to man's unquenchable thirst for understanding. It brings the seeds of scientific understanding which may open a new chapter in the history of our planet.
We salute Astronauts Scott, Irwin, and Worden, who have stood poised on behalf of mankind on the brink of man's new world. To each we say well done, and welcome home.
Note: The statement was released at Bangor, Maine.
