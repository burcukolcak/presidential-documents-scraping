Statement on the Tax Reform Bill Following Passage by the House of Representatives.
IN MY MESSAGE to Congress on April 21, I stated that "we shall never make taxation popular, but we can make taxation fair."
The tax reform bill just passed by the House of Representatives is a long step in that direction. Not only did the House adopt, 'in essence, the administration's proposed minimum income tax and low income allowance, but it also added many constructive reforms to the 16 we proposed initially.
I am much aware of the many hours of cooperative labor that went into the preparation of this bill. To me this is further proof that the administration and the Congress, even in a time of politically divided government, can work constructively together to advance the national interest.
While the administration will have some suggestions in the Senate on certain specifics of this bill, I strongly endorse its passage by the House and commend the principal architects of the bill on the House Ways and Means Committee.
