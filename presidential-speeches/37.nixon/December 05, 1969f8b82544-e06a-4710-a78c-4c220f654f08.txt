Statement on Signing the Wildlife Bill.
IN APPROVING H.R. 11363 today, I am signing into law the most significant action this Nation has ever taken in an international effort to preserve the world's wildlife.
This act protecting wild creatures serves three purposes: It will help the States to conserve such species as our endangered alligators and other reptiles and lesser life as well; it will help other nations preserve species threatened with extinction by prohibiting importation of such animals into the United States; and it will provide additional authority and funds for this country to acquire land for the protection of native wildlife which is endangered. In addition, this legislation calls for an international meeting to develop binding conventions for worldwide conservation of animals.
This bill represents the culmination of many years of activity by many people in and out of government. It is effective and just legislation, and I take great pleasure in signing it into law.
Note: As enacted, the bill (H.R. 11363) is Public Law 91-135 (83 Stat. 275).
