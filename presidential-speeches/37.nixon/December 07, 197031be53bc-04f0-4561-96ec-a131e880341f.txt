Proclamation 4023â€”National Retailing Week

American retail merchants have provided an ever widening choice of products and services to meet consumer needs and desires. Retailing promotes the orderly functioning of our nationwide distribution system, and strengthens our national economy by creating employment and income.
Mindful of these facts, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 1255, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the period January 10, 1971, through January 16, 1971, as National Retailing Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the period January 10 through January 16, 1971, as National Retailing Week.
I urge all Americans during that period to pay special tribute, by every appropriate means, to our country's retail industry. I suggest both suppliers and customers of the industry take this opportunity to show their appreciation of the services retail management and employees provide.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fifth.


RICHARD NIXON
