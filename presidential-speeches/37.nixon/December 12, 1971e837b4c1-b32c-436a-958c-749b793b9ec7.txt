Statement on the Death of General David Sarnoff.
THE DEATH of General David Sarnoff is a great loss not only for America but for the world. A monumental figure in electronic communications, history will record him as a man of pioneering vision and indomitable action. General Sarnoff had those qualities of spirit that embody the highest tradition of our Nation--imagination, daring, patriotism, and generosity. Mrs. Nixon and I join his family and the Nation at large in mourning the passing of this gifted American.
Note: General Sarnoff, 80, died after a lengthy illness in New York City. He was chairman of the board of the Radio Corporation of America from 1947 until his retirement in 1970. At the time of his death, he was honorary chairman of the board.
The statement was released at Lajes Field, the Azores.
