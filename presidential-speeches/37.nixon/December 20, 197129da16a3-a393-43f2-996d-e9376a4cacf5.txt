Remarks in Bermuda Announcing Removal of Surcharge on Imports.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I have just had my first meeting with the Prime Minister. He felt that it would be well that I make this announcement prior to the time that we go into our more extended meetings this afternoon.
I have today made the first decision implementing the agreement which was reached over the weekend by the Group of Ten in their meetings in Washington. After consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State today, I have signed a proclamation [4098] removing the 10 percent surcharge.
This first step having been taken, we can now move on to the trade areas and the monetary areas in which agreement was also reached over the weekend.
Later today, on the American side, Secretary Connally and Secretary Rogers will brief the press, and on the British side I know arrangements will probably be made for proper briefings also.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 12: 50 p.m. on the grounds of Government House, Hamilton, Bermuda, following a preliminary meeting with Prime Minister Edward Heath of the United Kingdom.
On the same day, the White House released the transcript of a news briefing by Secretary of State William P. Rogers on his meetings in Bermuda with Sir Alec Douglas-Home, British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. The White House also released the transcript of a news briefing by Secretary of the Treasury John B. Connally on his meetings in Bermuda with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Anthony Barber and on international trade and monetary affairs. The transcripts of the briefings are printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 7, PP. 1694 and 1695 ).
