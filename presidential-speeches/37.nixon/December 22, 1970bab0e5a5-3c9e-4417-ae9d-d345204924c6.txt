Letter to the House Minority Leader on Social Security Legislation.
Dear Jerry:
In response to your question about my attitude toward the Social Security legislation [H.R. 17550] now stalled in the Senate, be assured that I favor quick enactment.
Some Senators contend that Social Security legislation cannot be salvaged in this Senate unless welfare reform, appropriations bills and other vital measures are sacrificed. I am not yet willing to concede the Senate's indifference or impotence. I have urged the Senate to bring to vote all of this important work that lies before it. There is still plenty of time to do what is necessary before January 3.
Should the Senate be unable or unwilling to adopt these vital measures by then, I will resubmit the Social Security benefit increases and welfare reform, along with the other key bills that remain unenacted. And I will propose that the Social Security increases be retroactive in their effect to January 1, 1971, so that no Social Security recipient is harmed by the Senate's failure to act.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable Gerald R. Ford, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. 20515]
