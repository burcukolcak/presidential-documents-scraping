Remarks Following a Meeting With the Director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
Ladies and gentlemen:
This is the first opportunity that I have had since the inauguration to meet with Roy Wilkins, the head of the NAACP.
During the years I was Vice President, and as a Congressman and a Senator, we came to know each other well.
I was remarking that the last time we met and had a chance to talk was in a long plane ride all the way back from Paris to the United States. He had been on a lecture tour, and I had been on a trip abroad involving private business and some conversations with foreign officials.
Mr. Wilkins, of course, will answer your questions with regard to the administration and the conversation we had.
I simply want to say that this is one of a series of meetings that I am trying to have with leaders of the Negro community, as well as representatives of other groups in this country.
I have found through the years that with Roy Wilkins it is possible to have a very direct and candid discussion. We don't always agree, but he gives excellent advice---advice which many times we follow. This is only the first of a series of meetings, and since it was the first I wanted to present him personally to the members of the press, all of whom I am sure know him.
Roy, the floor is yours.
Note: The President spoke at 3:55 p.m. in the Fish Room at the White House, after which Mr. Wilkins responded to reporters' questions.
