Statement Announcing the Nomination of John G. Veneman as Under Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare
I AM particularly pleased that Jack Veneman, considered the California Legislature's leading authority in the areas of health care, welfare, and taxation, has agreed to serve as Under Secretary for Health, Education, and Welfare.
During his tenure in the California State Legislature, Mr. Veneman has made significant contributions in building the progressive programs necessary to meet the human needs of the people of California.
Urban problems are certainly the high priority of this administration. In recruiting people for key positions this administration seeks those with the talent to do the job and a sense of social conscience. These are essential if we are to have an impact on the problems besetting the American people today.
