Statement Following Splashdown of Apollo 14.
ONCE again earth has welcomed back its own, and I join people everywhere in rejoicing both at the safe return of Astronauts Shepard, Mitchell, and Roosa and at the successful completion of their mission.
It was on May 5, 1961, that Alan Shepard made America's historic first suborbital flight aboard Freedom 7. Now, a decade later, he returns from the moon as commander of the three-man crew of Apollo 14. The difference between that first flight and this latest is a measure of how far we have progressed in space in the short span of 10 years. But two things have not changed: the courage and determination of the men who fly these missions, and the skill and dedication of the thousands here on earth who make their flights possible.
To each and every one of the many people who contributed to the success of Apollo 14, a grateful nation says: "Well done." And to the astronauts themselves--to Captain Shepard, Commander Mitchell, and Major Roosa--we all will add an equally hearty: "Welcome home."
Note: Shortly after splashdown, President Nixon telephoned the Apollo 14 astronauts aboard the U.S.S. New Orleans in the South Pacific to express his personal congratulations on the completion of their mission.
