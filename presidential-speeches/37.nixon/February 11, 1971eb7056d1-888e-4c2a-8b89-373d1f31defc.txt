Statement on the Anniversary of the Birth of Abraham Lincoln.
ONE of the first things most Americans learn about the Republican Party is that it is the party of Abraham Lincoln. As we observe the anniversary of his birth, it is appropriate that we think again about the principles he observed and how they can be implemented in our time.
Lincoln knew that free people and open opportunities were the driving force of America; today we must protect individual freedom and expand individual opportunity. Lincoln knew that our State and local governments were vital to our people and should work with, not against our Federal government; we must enhance the innovativeness, responsiveness and efficiency of State and local government with creative Federal support. Lincoln knew that freedom and progress could only flourish under the orderly rule of law; we must restore our laws and enforcement systems to their rightful place of honor and respect. Lincoln knew that our power among nations grew out of our freedoms at home; today, our ability to support freedom around the world can only be built on the freedom and self-confidence of our own people.
At Gettysburg, Lincoln resolved that "this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom .... "Today, as we honor this great President, let us rededicate ourselves to that eternal goal.
