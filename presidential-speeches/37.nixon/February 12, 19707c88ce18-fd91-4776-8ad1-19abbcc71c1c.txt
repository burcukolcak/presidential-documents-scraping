Proclamation 3962â€”International Education Year

The United Nations Charter expresses the determination of the peoples of the United Nations "to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights," and "in the dignity and worth of the human person. . . ."
Education is a fundamental human right, one that recognizes and helps to preserve the dignity and the worth of human beings. With this in mind, the United Nations has designated 1970 as International Education Year and has called upon each member state to intensify its domestic educational efforts.
It is to that end that I, Richard Nixon, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim 1970 to be International Education Year in the United States.
I call upon all Americans to join our fellow citizens of the world in making this year one of reflection on the state of education as it exists and of action directed toward making education what it should be.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.


RICHARD NIXON
NOTE: The proclamation was released at Key Biscayne, Fla.
