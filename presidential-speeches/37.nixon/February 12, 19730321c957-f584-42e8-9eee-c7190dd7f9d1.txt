Statement About the Death of David Lawrence
FOR MORE than half a century, David Lawrence wrote with clarity and conviction about the public issues of our times. At his death he was not only a dean of his profession but also one of our most distinguished patriots.
Along with millions of other Americans, I shall miss him deeply.
Note: Mr. Lawrence, 84, died in Sarasota, Fla., on February 11, 1973. At the time of his death, he was the writer of a syndicated column and editor and chairman of the board of U.S. News and World Report.
On April 22, 1970, at a White House ceremony, Mr. Lawrence was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contributions to journalism. See 1970 volume, Item 131.
The statement was issued at San Clemente, Calif.
