Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of the National Science Foundation.
To the Congress of the United States:
The activities of the National Science Foundation are essential in increasing the Nation's fund of scientific knowledge, providing science training for our youth, and harnessing the forces of science for the good of our citizens. I am today submitting to the Congress the Nineteenth Annual Report of the Foundation, which tells of significant accomplishments in Fiscal Year 1969.
In that twelve-month period, the Foundation provided $225 million to support scientific research in every State of the Union; it invested more than $106 million to improve science education at every level from elementary school through the university; and it supported the improvement of our institutions of higher education through development-related grants totaling more than $50 million.
All of these investments will, I am confident, produce important benefits for our society. I am pleased to note that a number of such benefits were realized in Fiscal Year 1969 as a direct result of Foundation programs. As we go forward into the decade of the 70s, the role of science will surely become more and more important in the search for solutions to our problems and in the effort to enhance our environment.
