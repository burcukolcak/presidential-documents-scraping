Statement About a National Health Strategy Proposal
I AM PROPOSING today a new national health strategy. It helps more people to pay for care--but it also expands the supply of health services and makes them more efficient. It emphasizes keeping people well--and not just making people well.

The purpose of this program is simply this: I want America to have the finest health care in the world--and I want every American to be able to get that care when he needs it.
