Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of the National Science Board.
To the Congress of the United States:
I hereby transmit to the Congress the second annual report of the National Science Board, pursuant to the provisions of P.L. 90-407 [82 Stat. 360]. The report was prepared by the 25 distinguished Members of the policy-making body of the National Science Foundation.
The report recounts the state of knowledge in the physical sciences--astronomy, chemistry and physics--as well as how physical science research is carried out in the United States. It also makes a number of recommendations reflecting the importance that the Board ascribes to the Nation's support of the physical sciences. I commend this report to your attention.
