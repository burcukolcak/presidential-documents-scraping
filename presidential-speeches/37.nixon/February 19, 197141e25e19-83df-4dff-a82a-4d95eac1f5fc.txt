Memorandum About the 1971 Federal Summer Intern Program.
Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
Our experience with the Federal Government's summer intern programs in these past two years--the 1969 Executive intern Program and the 1970 Washington Summer Intern Program--has been most rewarding. We benefited greatly from the direct contributions of the interns, including constructive ideas which could have been born in no other place than the crucible of on-the-spot experience. At the same time, many of the most promising members of the younger generation were given a unique opportunity to become acquainted with the people in government, the functions they perform and the problems they face.
Because the value of these programs has proven to be so great, I am directing expanded efforts in support of the 1971 Federal Summer Intern Program.
I have called for an alliance between the generations. I have asked American youth to respond affirmatively to the challenge and pledged that we will do our best to keep faith with their hopes. An outstanding Federal Summer Intern Program will be another step in fulfilling our part of the bargain.
I ask each of you to assure the full participation of your organization, to help make this summer the most fruitful ever in terms of nurturing better understanding between young Americans and their Government. The Chairman of the Civil Service Commission will provide the necessary leadership for the program, will measure its results, and will report to me next fall.
