Statement About National Brotherhood Week, 1970
THE TRADITION of Brotherhood Week is both a symbol and an incentive for the kind of society we seek. As a symbol, it remains the indispensable prerequisite to success in our American way of life. As an incentive, it constantly reminds us to rededicate ourselves to the ideals on which our country, and indeed the family of man, rest.
Winston Churchill once said that houses are built of bricks, mortar, and good will-not politics, prejudices, and spite. And the house of human brotherhood is no exception.
From ancient time man has acknowledged the mystic bond of charity. But even before we can have charity, we must have respect for one another. So the National Conference of Christians and Jews which sponsors this observance appropriately calls to our attention that "Brotherhood Begins with Respect."
I know that countless fellow Americans will derive new inspiration from this ageless message. And I commend all who do their part to translate it into good works for their fellow man, and new unity for the Nation.
Note: National Brotherhood Week was oh. served from February 22 to 28, 1970.
