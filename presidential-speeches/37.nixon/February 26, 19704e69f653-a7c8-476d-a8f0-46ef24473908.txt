Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report on the Communications Satellite Program.
To the Congress of the United States:
On July 20, 1969, from the Oval Office in the White House, I spoke by telephone with Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin on the surface of the Moon. This historic event was simultaneously televised to the world through the medium of communication satellites. Under Section 404 (a) of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962, I am sending to the Congress this seventh report on the program that helped bring this historic event to millions of people throughout the world.
Communications between Earth and the Moon, while certainly the most dramatic use, is only one of many ways in which satellite communications can now be employed. The Intelsat Consortium of more than 70 nations has been highly successful in bringing the benefits of communications satellite technology to the people of many nations. This report reflects the steady progress being made toward an improved global communications network. Already we see major improvements in international telecommunications capabilities--improvements that will ultimately benefit all of the world's people.
The Communications Satellite Act speaks of the contribution to be made to "world peace and understanding" by a commercial communications satellite system. Just as this technology has enabled men to speak to each other across the boundary of outer space, so, I am convinced, satellite communications will in future years help men to understand one another better across boundaries of a political, linguistic and social nature. World peace and understanding are goals worthy of this new and exciting means of communication.
