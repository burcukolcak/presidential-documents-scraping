Statement on the Death of Representative Charles M. Teague of California.
THE death of Charles Teague represents a significant loss to the United States Congress, to his home State of California, and to the Nation he served so long and so well. He will be remembered most especially for his interest in American agriculture and for his many years of devoted service on the House Agriculture Committee. Mrs. Nixon and I were deeply saddened to hear of his passing, and we extend our sincere sympathy to his family.
Note: Representative Teague, 64, died in Santa Paula, Calif. He was the senior Republican member of the House Agriculture Committee.
The President telephoned Representative Teague's son, Mayor Alan Teague of Santa Paula, to express his condolences.
The statement was issued at San Clemente, Calif.
