Statement About the Death of George M. Humphrey
GEORGE HUMPHREY was a man of firm purpose, unremitting effort, and high dedication. His great contributions to American life--both in industry and Government--leave all of us in his debt. As I mourn the loss of a friend, I offer my most sincere condolences to his family. I know that they will be sustained in this time of grief by the realization that George Humphrey leaves an outstanding legacy of achievement and service.
Note: Mr. Humphrey died in Cleveland, Ohio, on January 20, 1970, at the age of 79. He had served as Secretary of the Treasury in the Eisenhower administration from 1953 to 1957.
The statement was read by Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler during his regular news briefing at the White House on January 21, 1970.
