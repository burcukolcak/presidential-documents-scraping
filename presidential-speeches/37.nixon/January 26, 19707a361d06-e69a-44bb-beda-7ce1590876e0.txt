Message to the Congress Transmitting an Amendment to the Agreement Between the United States and the United Kingdom on Uses of Atomic Energy
To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended, I am submitting to the Congress an authoritative copy of an amendment to the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes of July 3, 1958, as amended. The Amendment was signed at Washington on October 16, 1969.
The Agreement as amended included a provision (Paragraph A of Article III bis) under which the Government of the United States agreed to transfer to the Government of the United Kingdom for its atomic weapons program prior to December 31, 1969 in such quantities and on such terms and conditions as may be agreed non-nuclear parts of atomic weapons and atomic weapons systems as well as source, by-product and special nuclear material. A second provision of the Agreement (Paragraph C of Article III bis) stipulated that the Government of the United Kingdom would transfer to the Government of the United States for military purposes such source, by-product and special nuclear material, and equipment of such types, in such quantities, at such times prior to December 31, 1969 and on such terms and conditions as may be agreed.
Under the Amendment submitted herewith the period during which the provisions of Paragraphs A and C of Article III his of the Agreement for Cooperation remain in force would be extended for five years so that transfers could be made any time prior to December 31, 1974. The continued authorization of the two Governments to cooperate with each other in these respects would contribute to our mutual defense, particularly in the North Atlantic Treaty area.
I am also transmitting a copy of the Secretary of State's letter to me accompanying authoritative copies of the signed Amendment, a copy of a joint letter from the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and the Secretary of Defense recommending approval of this Amendment, and a copy of my memorandum in reply thereto, setting forth my approval.
