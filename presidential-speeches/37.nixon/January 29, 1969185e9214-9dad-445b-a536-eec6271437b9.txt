Statement About the Nomination of Gerard C. Smith as Director, United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
GERARD SMITH has the experience, the knowledge, and the dedication for this job. He was engaged in developing proposals for a test ban as early as a decade ago. President Kennedy credited him with the original proposal for the Washington-Moscow "hot line."
The tasks of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency belong to the most important of my administration. I know that Mr. Smith will address them with all the urgency and emphasis that they deserve.
To this end I am directing that the role and status of the ACDA within the United States Government be upgraded. Mr. Smith will have direct and ready access to the Secretary of State and to the President and will participate in all meetings of the National Security Council at which matters within the scope of his mission are considered.
NOTE.: The statement was read by Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler at his news briefing at 5:42 p.m. on Wednesday, January 29, 1969.
