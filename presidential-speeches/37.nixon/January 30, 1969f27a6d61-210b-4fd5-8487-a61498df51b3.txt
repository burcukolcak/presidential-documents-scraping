Statement on the Death of Allen Dulles.
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK last night, America lost a most valued public servant and the world lost a dedicated and courageous defender of freedom.
The death of Allen Dulles came at a time when his qualities of deliberation, integrity, and intelligence are more than ever those on which free men must rely. He served his country in the great tradition of his family and with unstinting devotion to duty.
During the years he served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, I had the opportunity to meet with him on many occasions. My impression of him then is my impression now: He was a man who brought civility, intelligence, and great dedication to everything he did. In the nature of his task, his achievements were known to only a few. But because of him--the world is a safer place today.
I know that all Americans join with Director Helms, Mrs. Nixon, and with me in extending our deepest sympathy to his family.
Note: Allen W. Dulles, who served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency 1953-1961, died at the age of 75 at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington., D.C.
