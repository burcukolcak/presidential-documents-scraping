Statement on the Death of Murray M. Chotiner.
I AM profoundly saddened by the death of Murray Chotiner. For more than a quarter of a century, he was an ally in political battles, a valued counselor, and a trusted colleague. But above all, Murray Chotiner was my friend. His friendship never wavered; in periods of adversity it grew stronger.
While some recoil from the label "politician," Murray was rightly proud of it because he was a professional who had the respect and admiration of those who worked with hint. In life he had my respect and deep friendship; he will forever have my gratitude. I shall miss him.
Mrs. Nixon joins me in extending to his wife, Nancy, and their family, our heartfelt sympathy.
Note: Mr. Chotiner, 64, died in Washington, D.C. He was General Counsel for the Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations from 1969-1970 and Special Counsel to the President from 1970-1971.
On February 4, 1974, the President and Mrs. Nixon and Rose Mary Woods, Executive Assistant and Personal Secretary to the President, attended funeral services for Mr. Chotiner at the Washington Hebrew Congregation Temple in Washington, D.C.
