Statement Following Senate Approval of the Conquest of Cancer Bill.
THE SENATE deserves the thanks of all Americans for its prompt bipartisan action today in passing the conquest of cancer act introduced by Senator Dominick and cosponsored by 67 Senators of both parties. This measure represents an important part of the "total national commitment" to an intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer that I called for in my State of the Union Message and in my special message to the Congress on a national health strategy. Another essential part of that commitment was the additional $100 million I asked for cancer research. The Congress has already met that request, and I signed the bill on May 25.
But money alone will not be enough. The way we organize our work in this field is also extremely important. It was for that reason that on May 11, I proposed legislation to establish the cancer cure program that would be independently budgeted, with its Director responsible directly to the President.
Now that the Senate has acted on this program, I urge prompt agreement by the House of Representatives so that we can swiftly lengthen our strides against the dreaded ravages of cancer, bringing new hope to all Americans--and indeed bringing new hope to the world.
