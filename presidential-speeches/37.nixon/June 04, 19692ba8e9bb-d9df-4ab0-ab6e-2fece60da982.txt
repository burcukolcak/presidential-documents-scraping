Declaration of Amnesty for Air Force Academy Cadets.
WHEREAS, it is customary and traditional that a visiting Head of State at the United States Air Force Academy grant reprieve to those cadets who unfortunately are required to perform extra duty or suffer punishment for violation of United States Air Force Academy regulations;
And whereas, it is now desired that amnesty be granted on the occasion of this state visit to the United States Air Force Academy;
Therefore, I do proclaim amnesty for all cadets who have committed minor violations of United States Air Force Academy regulations.
RICHARD NIXON
