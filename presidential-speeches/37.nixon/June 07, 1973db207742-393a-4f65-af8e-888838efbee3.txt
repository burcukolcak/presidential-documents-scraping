Message to Captain Charles Conrad, Jr., USN, Commander of the Skylab 1 Crew.
ON BEHALF of the American people I congratulate and commend you and your crew on your successful effort to repair the world's first true space station.
In the 2 weeks since you left the Earth, you have more than fulfilled the prophecy of your parting words, "We can fix anything." All of us now have new courage that man can work in space to control his environment, improve his circumstances, and exert his will even as he does on Earth.
Note: The message was relayed to Skylab 1 astronauts Captain Conrad, Comdr. Joseph P. Kerwin, USN, and Comdr. Paul J. Weitz, USN, by officials at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center at Houston, Tex.
By deploying a jammed solar-panel wing which converts sunlight to electricity, the astronauts had made possible a more efficient operation of the scientific capabilities of the space station.
