Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report Comparing Federal and Private Enterprise Salaries.
To the Congress of the United States:
I forward herewith the annual comparison of Federal salaries with the salaries paid in private enterprise, as provided by section 5302 of title 5, United States Code.
The report, prepared by the Director of the Bureau of the Budget and the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission, compares the present Federal statutory salary rates with average salary rates paid in private enterprise for the same levels of work, as reported in the Bureau of Labor Statistics Bulletin No. 1617, National Survey of Professional, Administrative, Technical, and Clerical Pay, June 1968.
Also transmitted is a copy of an Executive order promulgating the adjustments of statutory salary rates to become effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after July 1, 1969. These adjustments were developed in the joint report from the Director and Chairman, and in accordance with the directions of section 212 of Public Law 90-206, the Federal Salary Act of 1967.
Public Law 90-206 provides that comparable adjustments shall be made, by administrative action of appropriate officers, in the salary rates of employees of the judicial and legislative branches and those of Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation County Committee employees.
