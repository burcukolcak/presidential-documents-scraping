Letter to the Secretary of State Directing Suspension of Restrictions on Meat Imports.
Dear Mr. Secretary:
After careful study of the changed conditions in the U.S. and world markets in beef, I have determined that we should now take action to increase the importation of meat into the United States for the remainder of this year.
I request that you take steps immediately with our foreign suppliers to remove restraints established under present arrangements with these suppliers. I ask that you indicate to them that since we have now moved toward a freer market in meat for the remainder of this year, it is my hope that the effect of this action will be to increase the amount of imports entering the United States.
I further request that you collaborate as closely as possible with the Secretary of Agriculture to insure that the steps I have taken are implemented with all possible speed.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable William P. Rogers, Secretary of State, Washington, D.C.]
