Executive Order 11600â€”Establishing a Seal for the Office of Management and Budget
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget has caused to be made, and has recommended that I approve, a seal of Office for the Office of Management and Budget, the design of which accompanies and is hereby made a part of this order, and which is described as follows:
On a blue disc, the Arms of the United States proper above a curved gold scroll inscribed "OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET", in black raised letters, all within a white border edged gold and inscribed "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES", in blue raised letters. Dark blue suggested by the Seal of the President denotes the direct organizational link with the Presidential office. The Arms of the United States refer to the entire Nation and represent the Office's involvement in the organizational and technological processes necessary to assist the President in his role as Chief Executive of the United States. It appears that such a seal is of suitable design and appropriate for adoption as the official seal of the Office of Management and Budget.
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, I hereby approve such seal as the official seal of the Office of Management and Budget.
