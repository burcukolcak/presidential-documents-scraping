Letter to the President of the Senate Requesting Budget Amendments for Fiscal 1971 School Lunch and Child Nutrition Programs.
Sir:
I ask the Congress to consider an amendment to the requests for appropriations in the budget for fiscal year 1971 in the amount of $216,579,000 for the Department of Agriculture for the Child Nutrition Programs to carry out Public Law 91-248.
As I stated on approving this legislation on May 14, "This legislation will help the Administration achieve its goal of expanding the school lunch program for all children and providing free or reduced price lunches for every needy child."
Further details of this proposal and the necessity therefore are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, with whose cornments and recommendations I concur.

Respectfully yours,
RICHARD NIXON
[The President of the Senate]
