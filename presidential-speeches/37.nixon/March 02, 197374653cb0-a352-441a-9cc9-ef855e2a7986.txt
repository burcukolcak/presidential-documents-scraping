Statement on the Slaying of Two American Diplomats by Terrorists in Khartoum, The Sudan.
IT WAS with the deepest sense of grief that I have learned of the acts of terrorism which took the lives of Ambassador Cleo A. Noel and Deputy Chief of Mission George Curtis Moore. The United States is emphasizing its strong feeling that the perpetrators of this crime must be brought to justice.
This tragic event underscores once again the need for all nations to take a firm stand against the menace of international terrorism. I know the American people join me in expressing our deepest sympathy to the families of these diplomats who have given the last full measure of devotion in service to their country.
Note: Ambassador Noel and Mr. Moore, along with Belgian Charge d'Affaires Guy Eid, were slain a day after they had been captured and held hostage by members of the Black September terrorist group in the Saudi Arabian Embassy. Two days later, the terrorists surrendered to Sudanese officials, releasing unharmed the Saudi Arabian Ambassador and the Jordanian Charge d'Affaires.
The White House announced that the President ordered the White House flag to be flown at half-staff, together with the flags of the Department of State and all American consular posts abroad, until the interment of Ambassador Noel and Mr. Moore.
