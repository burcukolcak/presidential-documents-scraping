Memorandum to Members of an Interagency Economic Adjustment Committee
Memorandum for Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Secretary of Transportation, Administrator, General Services Administration, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors:
This Administration is committed to bringing the resources of the Federal government to bear on the alleviation of economic difficulties caused by necessary Defense realignments.
Therefore, I am directing the Secretary of Defense to take the leadership responsibility in assisting individuals and communities in cases where adverse economic impacts occur as a result of the revision of our military base structure. I am asking each addressee to serve as a member of an Inter-Agency Economic Adjustment Committee, which will be chaired by the Secretary of Defense. He will seek the assistance of each agency in meeting this responsibility, and will also enlist the support of State and local governments and the private sector.
Your cooperation in devoting the resources of your agency to this effort will be appreciated.
RICHARD NIXON
