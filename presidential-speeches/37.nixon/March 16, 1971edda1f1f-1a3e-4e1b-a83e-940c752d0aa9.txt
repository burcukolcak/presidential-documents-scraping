St. Patrick's Day Statement
St. Patrick's Day is a great day for the Irish, to be sure, but it is also a great day for all Americans. It is a time of celebration not only for those of our citizens whose ancestors were born on the Emerald Isle, but also for countless others who value those qualities of warmth and humor, pride and courage which are so closely associated with the Irish people.
Americans of Irish descent have given a great deal to this country, in fields ranging from government and politics to business and commerce, from science and technology to art and music and literature. The American spirit reflects contributions from every nation. But the charm of the Irish culture has permeated life in this country in a manner which has been especially profound.
I have always felt particularly close to Ireland. One could hardly feel any other way when some of his own ancestors came from that country--and when his wife is the former Pat Ryan, and celebrates her birthday on St. Patrick's Day.
On this St. Patrick's Day, I am especially pleased to greet my fellow Americans of Irish descent--and all Americans who share a feeling of deep gratitude for what the Irish have given us--with this traditional Irish greeting: "Joy be with you all."
