Message to the President of Ireland on St. Patrick's Day.
ON THIS Saint Patrick's Day, the American people and I extend our warmest greeting to you and the people of Ireland. Proud of my own and of my wife's Irish heritage and proud of the contributions made by the Irish to the United States and to the cause of freedom everywhere, I look forward to a continuation of that spirit of cooperation and friendship which has for so long existed between your country and mine.
RICHARD NIXON
[The Honorable Eamon de Valera, President of Eire]
