Proclamation 3902â€”National Maritime Day, 1969

The American Merchant Marine must project the Nation's economic strength throughout the world in peacetime and give mobility to our national defense in times of emergency. Its vessels must enable us to compete effectively in international trade and to transport and supply our Armed Forces in defense of freedom.
Through the cooperation of business, labor, and Government, and with prudent use of advancing technology, the American Merchant Marine must become capable of providing modern, productive service to the Nation's commerce as an integral part of transportation.
A strong and profitable merchant fleet is vital to America's economic welfare and defense capability. The American flag on merchant vessels on the high seas and in foreign ports is a symbol of our Nation's dedication to peaceful trade throughout the world.
To remind Americans of the important role the Merchant Marine plays in our national life, the Congress in 1933 designated the anniversary of the first transatlantic voyage by a steamship, the SS Savannah, on May 22, 1819, as National Maritime Day, and requested the President to issue a proclamation annually in observance of that day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to honor our American Merchant Marine on May 22, 1969, by displaying the flag of the United States, at their homes and other suitable places, and I request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day in tribute to the American Merchant Marine.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.
