Remarks on Presenting the Boy of the Year Award
I AM very happy to make this presentation to James Heath. He has been selected out of 850,000 boys all over America who are members of Boys' Clubs as the outstanding boy of the year.
When I think back on others who have received this award--I think this, perhaps, is the 10th time, as Vice President, then when I was out of office as chairman of the board of the Boys Clubs and then once as President and now twice that I have made this presentation I think back of the 10 men, now men, who received this award.
I can only say that the boy it is going to make a great record in years ahead.
I want to congratulate you and you the very best.
Note: The President spoke at 12: 10 p.m. the Roosevelt Room at the White House.
James Heath received a $4,000 from the Reader's Digest Foundation, of the "Boy of the Year" competition of Boys' Clubs of America. Nine regional of the 24th annual competition were present.
