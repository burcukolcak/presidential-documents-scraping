Remarks at the Swearing In of Donald L. Jackson as a Member of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
BEFORE you have the swearing in, would you please sit down? I would like to indicate to all of those who are our guests here that it is not usual for the President to be present for the swearing in of a member of one of the Commissions. It seemed that there is always a reason for an exception, and since Don Jackson and I came from almost neighboring districts in California to the Congress 22 years ago, campaigned together--he in my district and I in his--and have been friends and associates through those years, that as he moves now to the Interstate Commerce Commission I wanted to be present.
I am very confident he will do a very effective job as a member of that Commission, just as he was one of the exceptional Members of the Congress beginning in the Both Congress, and as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Since he is an expert in foreign affairs, he will now concentrate on commerce within the United States.
[At this point, the oath of office was administered by Attorney General John N. Mitchell. The President then resumed speaking.]
I have never heard the press applaud so much before. They are some of your colleagues, Mr. Jackson.
Note: The President spoke at 12:04 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White House at the swearing in of Donald L. Jackson, Representative from California 1947-1961.
Following the President's remarks, Mr. Jackson spoke. The text of his remarks is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 5, P. 440).
