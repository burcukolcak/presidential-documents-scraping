Statement About Work Stoppages in the Postal System
THE meetings held Friday between Government officials and leaders of the postal unions provide the foundation for a swift end to the work stoppages in the postal system and the rapid reestablishment of the Nation's postal service. Were these unauthorized work stoppages to continue for any duration of time it would seriously jeopardize the national public interest.
The men who work in the United States postal service have taken the same oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States as I have taken. Further, their proud tradition--that the "mails must go through"--dates to the earliest days of our Republic. I expect that both the oath and the tradition will be honored, as they are now being honored by the overwhelming majority of postal employees who have remained on the job.
There are legitimate grievances that have been brought to the fore in the current postal crisis. But those grievances cannot justify illegal remedies, and those grievances cannot and will not be negotiated or ameliorated in a climate of intimidation.
