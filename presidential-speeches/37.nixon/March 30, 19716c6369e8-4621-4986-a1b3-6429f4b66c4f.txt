Memorandum About the Federal Summer Employment Program for Youth.
Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
When schools close for the summer, many students will seek summer employment. Some will need the earnings to continue their education or to help out at home. To others the job might mean a start toward a new career, or a chance to relate classroom theory to practical experience. Under the Federal Summer Employment Program for Youth, we have the opportunity to support the aspirations of young Americans by:

--Making it possible for them to obtain employment experience and concurrently to witness the functioning of their Government at close range.

--Broadening their career horizons to include the wide variety of occupations in Government.

--Providing them opportunities to exchange ideas and to receive advice and counsel from Government officials.
In addition to students employed through merit staffing procedures on the basis of their abilities, we must provide opportunities for needy youth to earn money and learn about the world of work. For this latter purpose, your general goal should be to employ one needy youth for every 40 regular employees on your payroll.
The Chairman of the Civil Service Commission will continue to provide the leadership and necessary guidelines for all aspects of our Federal Summer Employment Program for Youth, and will report to me on its results.
