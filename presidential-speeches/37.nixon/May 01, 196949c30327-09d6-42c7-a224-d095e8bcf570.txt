Statement on the Death of Washington Newspaperman Jeremiah O'Leary.
I WAS SADDENED to learn of the death yesterday of Jerry O'Leary. For 47 years, until his retirement in 1964, Mr. O'Leary served with great distinction as a reporter for the Washington Star.
He was a reporter who covered the Senate and the political scene with fairness and insight, and his passing is mourned by all those in journalism and government who value the quality of integrity he so richly possessed.
