Statement on the Deaths of Four Students at Kent State University, Kent, Ohio.
THIS should remind us all once again that when dissent turns to violence, it invites tragedy. It is my hope that this tragic and unfortunate incident will strengthen the determination of all the Nation's campuses--administrators, faculty, and students alike--to stand firmly for the right which exists in this country of peaceful dissent and just as strongly against the resort to violence as a means of such expression.
Note: The statement was read by Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler at his regular afternoon news briefing.
