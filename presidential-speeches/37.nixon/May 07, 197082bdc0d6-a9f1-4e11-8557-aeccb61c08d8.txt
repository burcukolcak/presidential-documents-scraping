Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Reports of River Basins Commissions.
To the Congress of the United States:
In the last few years we have become more aware than ever that the quality of American life depends largely upon how we use--and conserve--our natural resources. It was this growing awareness that prompted the enactment of the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965.
That Act provides for the establishment of river basin commissions---if requested by the States in the appropriate area--to plan for the best use and development of rivers, their adjoining land and their resources. The river basin commissions assure that the people within each area will have a voice in deciding how these resources are used. This approach to planning promises more efficient use of America's great natural and man-made wealth, and more attention to preserving the beauty and vitality of our environment.
Today I transmit the annual reports of the four commissions that have been established under the Act. They are the Pacific Northwest River Basins Commission, the Souris-Red-Rainy River Basins Commission, the Great Lakes Basin Commission, and the New England River Basins Commission-covering areas in 21 states.
These annual reports reflect the accomplishments of each commission during Fiscal Year 1969. They describe existing and emerging problems in the use of our river basins, and help in evaluating opportunities for their sound development.
