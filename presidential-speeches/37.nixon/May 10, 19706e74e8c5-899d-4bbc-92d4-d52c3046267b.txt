Statement About the Death of Walter P. Reuther
THE TRAGIC DEATH of Walter Reuther is a deep loss not only for organized labor but also for the cause of collective bargaining and the entire American process. He was a man who was devoted to his cause, spoke for it eloquently, and worked for it tirelessly. While he was outspoken and controversial, even those who disagreed with him had great respect for his ability, integrity, and persistence.
For the Reuther family, the tragedy of this day is compounded by the death of Mrs. Reuther. Mrs. Nixon joins me in offering our heartfelt sympathy to them, and in expressing the hope that the memory of Walter Reuther's great achievements, with the constant help of his wife, will sustain them at this sad time.
Note: Mr. Reuther died on May 9, in the crash of a private plane in northern Michigan. He had served as president of the United Auto Workers since 1946.
