Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of the National Capital Housing Authority.
To the Congress of the United States:
Although confronted with the same financial problems during fiscal year 1969 that plagued public housing agencies throughout the nation, the National Capital Housing Authority continued its search for new ways to provide good housing for the low income residents of the District of Columbia. The Authority made progress in many areas toward increasing both the supply and the utility of public housing. Details of this progress are reported in the authority's annual report, which I transmit herewith.
The effort to provide a sound public housing program requires concerted cooperation and coordination among all levels of government, private enterprise, and the community. Under Mayor Washington's leadership, I anticipate that further important progress will be made toward achieving our goal of decent housing and effective community services for all the residents of our Nation's Capital.
