Letter to Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel About Arab Terrorist Attack at Ma'alot, Israel.
Dear Madame Prime Minister:
Our sorrow for the tragic loss of so many of Israel's children at Ma'alot cannot be expressed in words. Mrs. Nixon and I, along with all Americans, grieve with you and with the parents and schoolmates of those who died. This senseless act of terrorism has underscored once again the need for true peace in the Middle East. I can assure you that our efforts toward this goal will not waver. Please extend, Madame Prime Minister, my personal condolences to the Israeli people in this time of mourning.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
