Message to the Congress Transmitting the Annual Report of the Board of Actuaries for the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan
To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to Section 1444 (b) , title 10, United States Code, transmitted herewith is the Fourteenth Annual Report of the Board of Actuaries for the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan, covering the administration of the Plan for Calendar Year 1967.
The Plan, inaugurated in November 1953, provides that members of the uniformed services may elect reduced retired pay during their lifetime in order to provide survivor annuities for their widows and children. The basic principle underlying the Plan is that reductions in retired pay shall be computed by the actuarially equivalent method using actuarial tables selected by the Board. Thus, the Plan is to be self-supporting, imposing no added cost to the Federal Government, beyond administrative costs.
