Statement on the Death of Former Governor Goodwin Knight of California.
IT WAS with a deep sense of sadness that I learned of the death of former Governor Goodwin Knight. His distinguished contributions to good government in the State of California and his devoted service to its people will long serve as a fitting memorial to him. As a fellow Californian, I knew Goodwin Knight well and admired him not only for his great abilities in politics and government and for his remarkable zest and vitality, but also for his qualities as a man. Mrs. Nixon joins me in extending our most sincere condolences to his family.
Note: Governor Knight, 73, died of pneumonia on May 22, 1970, at Inglewood, Calif. He served as Governor from 1953 to 1958.
