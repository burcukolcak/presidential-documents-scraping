Statement on the Death of the Duke of Windsor.
MRS. NIXON and I are both deeply saddened by the death of the Duke of Windsor. He was a man of noble spirit and high ideals, for whom millions of Americans felt a deep respect and affection. We join in extending our profound sympathy to the Duchess, and to the many others who will mourn his passing.
Note: The Duke of Windsor, 77, died at his home in Paris, France, following a prolonged illness. He became King Edward VIII of England in January 1936 after the death of his father, George V, and then abdicated the throne in December 1936 in order to marry Mrs. Wallis Warfield Simpson.
The statement was released at Moscow, U.S.S.R.
