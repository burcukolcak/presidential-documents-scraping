Statement on the Death of Richard Cardinal Cushing.
TODAY not only Boston but the Nation, not only Catholics but citizens of every faith mourn the death of Richard Cardinal Cushing.
Just as all of us drew strength and inspiration from his life, so too do we grieve this loss. But we are comforted by the knowledge that he lived so fully and sought so persistently to serve the spiritual needs and social well-being of others. His name will always evoke for us a spirit of ecumenism, of human dignity, justice, and brotherhood among men and nations.

Cardinal Cushing died at his home in Boston at the age of 75. He was the Archbishop of Boston from September 25, 1944, until his retirement on September 8, 1970.
