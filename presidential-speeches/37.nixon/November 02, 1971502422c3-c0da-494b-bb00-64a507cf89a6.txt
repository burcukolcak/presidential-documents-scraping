Remarks Following a Meeting With Prime Minister William McMahon of Australia.
THE MEETING lasted an hour and a half. The Prime Minister, as you know, was a former Foreign Minister and has a very broad understanding of world problems, and naturally a great part of our discussions dealt with bilateral problems.
I was interested in getting his analysis of the initiatives that we have taken on the world scene and his analysis of recent events.
It was a very helpful conversation from my standpoint, and I trust it was for him. We covered the whole range of activities, not only between our two countries but also on the world scene, with particular emphasis on our continuing commitments under the ANZUS Treaty.
I can speak with some feeling about that, because I was in Australia in 1967-and I, of course, was there for the first time in 1953--and I believe that this treaty, which makes the American commitment to that part of the world firm, is one of the fundamental pillars of our policy of peace in the Pacific. I was glad to be able to reiterate to the Prime Minister, as he did to me, our joint support of that treaty and its commitment.

I will cover the rest in my toast tonight.
Note: The President spoke at approximately 12: 25 p.m. on the South Grounds at the White House following the Prime Minister's departure after their initial meeting.
