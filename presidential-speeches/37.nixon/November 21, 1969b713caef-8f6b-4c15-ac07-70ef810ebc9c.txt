Letter to Lawrence E. Walsh Accepting His Resignation as Deputy Head of the U.S. Delegation to the Paris Meetings on Vietnam.
Dear Ed:
It is with special regret that I accept your resignation as Deputy Head of our Delegation to the Paris Meetings on Vietnam. This was a difficult assignment and I understand your disappointment with the progress achieved thus far.
Your fellow countrymen owe you a debt of gratitude for your efforts in behalf of peace--your contribution has been a great one. I want you to know how much I appreciate your outstanding work as well as the generous sacrifice of your personal interests which this assignment required. It was particularly heartening to learn that we can count on your help in the future.
With warm personal regards,
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[The Honorable Lawrence E. Walsh, Judge, 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, New York, New York]
