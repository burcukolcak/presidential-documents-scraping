Message to the Congress Transmitting Reports on the Military Incentive Awards Program.
To the Congress of the United States:
In September of 1965, the Congress of the United States authorized a new cash awards program for military personnel. This program was designed to provide members of the Armed Forces with an added incentive to reduce military costs and improve military efficiency. In accordance with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1124, I am herewith forwarding the reports of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation concerning cash awards which were made under this program during Fiscal Year 1970.
The most recent report on the Military Awards Program covered the first six months of 1969. The present report and all future reports will cover an entire fiscal year, as is presently the case with the civilian Incentive Awards Program which is run by the Civil Service Commission.
In Fiscal Year 1970--as in earlier years--the Military Awards Program was a great success. Suggestions from military personnel that were adopted during Fiscal Year 1970 saved the government over $166 million--substantially more than in any previous year. Tangible first year benefits derived from such suggestions since the program went into effect in 1965 have now reached a total of more than $439 million. Many benefits and improvements of an intangible nature have also been realized.
Some 205,888 suggestions were submitted by military personnel during the reporting period of which 32,854 were adopted. Cash awards for adopted suggestions totalled $1,979,111. More than 80 percent of the cash awards were paid to enlisted personnel. Payments varied from a minimum of $25 to a maximum which was somewhat more than $ 1,000.
The reports which I am forwarding from the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Transportation present additional information concerning payments made under the Military Awards Program, along with brief descriptions of some of the more noteworthy suggestions which were presented as a part of this program during Fiscal Year 1970.
