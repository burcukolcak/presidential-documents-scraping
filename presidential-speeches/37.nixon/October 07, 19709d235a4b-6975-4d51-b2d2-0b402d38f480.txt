Statement on National Newspaperboy Day, 1970.
NATIONAL Newspaperboy Day is a fine opportunity for all Americans to express their thanks and admiration for the independent youngsters who bring the news of the day to their doorsteps.
We express thanks for the responsible way in which at an early age they carry out their duties. And we show our appreciation for the unique experience that is preparing them to become better leaders in tomorrow's world.
America is proud of her newspaper boys--and confident that their delivery route will take them far in their chosen fields.
RICHARD NIXON
