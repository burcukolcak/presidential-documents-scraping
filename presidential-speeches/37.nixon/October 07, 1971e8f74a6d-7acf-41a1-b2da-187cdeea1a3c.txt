Statement About Congressional Action on Deferment of Federal Pay Raises
I AM most gratified by today's Senate vote supporting the deferral of the scheduled wage increase for Federal employees.
As a result of the support voted by the House 3 days ago and by the Senate today, I feel sure that Federal employees will better understand the necessity for this delay, and the integral part that it has in our efforts to achieve a new prosperity for all Americans.
Note: The legislation was introduced as H. Res. 596 and S. Res. 169.
