Letter to the President of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization on Airplane Hijacking.
Dear Mr. Binaghi:
It was deeply gratifying for me to learn that the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization had called upon states to take strong, concerted measures to deter hijacking for international blackmail purposes. The Council's concern with this threat to the safe and orderly growth of international civil aviation, its recognition of state responsibility for taking all appropriate action against this menace, and its acknowledgement of the need for joint action to enforce state responsibility constitute a significant advance in the effort to secure the safety of the international air traveller.
In accordance with the Council's Resolution, I have instructed my representatives to put before the Organization's Legal Committee a draft convention which would implement these principles. It is my hope that the participating states will take rapid and affirmative action on this proposal.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON

[Mr. Walter Binaghi, President of the Council, International Civil Aviation Organization, Montreal, Canada]
