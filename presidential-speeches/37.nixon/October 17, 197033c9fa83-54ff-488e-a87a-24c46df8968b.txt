Statement in Support of Republican Candidates in Wisconsin.
I GIVE my strong endorsement to Jack Olson for Governor and John Erickson for Senator.
As your first 4-year Governor, Jack Olson will stand firm against the kind of excessive government spending that drives up taxes and helps to drive up prices.
Governor Olson will carry on the superb work in cleaning up the environment that has made Wisconsin a leader of the Nation in this field. He is a valuable member of the Air Quality Advisory Board, helping the Nation as well as the State purify the air we breathe.
One basic reform of my administration has been to channel power and authority away from Washington, back to the States and to the people where it belongs--to make this happen and to rise to the new responsibility, strong and experienced Governors like Jack Olson are needed now as never before.
Now is the time, too, for teamwork in Washington--and with John Erickson, we will get the kind of teamwork we need to hold down the cost of living, to wage a war on crime, and to bring about a generation of peace.
John Erickson knows as few men do how to inspire young people and direct their energies to useful ends. He knows the campus community; he understands how to motivate the administrators, faculty, and students to isolate the disrupters and to govern the campus firmly from within. His special experience with young people would be especially valuable in the United States Senate, cooperating with this administration instead of fighting every step of the way.
I hope no citizen of Wisconsin will overlook the importance of the races for Congress and the State legislature; here, too, I urge you to support the men who will hold down the spending, move firmly against disorder, and back up those who are determined to bring peace with honor to Southeast Asia and the world.
