Statement in Support of the Republican Candidate for the United States Senate in Missouri.
THE PEOPLE of Missouri have an extraordinary opportunity in 1970: the chance to vote for a change by sending to the Senate an exceptionally able, aggressive young leader. I am proud to give John Danforth my strong endorsement, and I look forward to working with him in achieving progress for Missouri and for the Nation.
As Missouri's crusading Attorney General, John Danforth has shown both the State and Nation that he knows how to meet the problems of crime, drugs, and disorder with firmness and justice. He understands the urgency of rescuing our natural environment. He brings the perspective of the 1970's to the needs of the 1970's.
For Missouri, the election of John Danforth would be a long step toward effective and responsible two-party government-and it would mean representation in the Senate by a man in tune with the State and in tune with the times.

For the Nation, the election of John Danforth would bring to the Senate the kind of voice that it needs: a voice of reason and firmness that understands what today's issues are and what they require.
In the Senate, John Danforth will help us put an end to the reckless spending that feeds inflation and erodes the dollar. He will help make this an era of reform: reform of government, reform of welfare, reform of the old system that drained power and responsibility away from the States and away from the people. He has given strong support to our initiatives for a just and honorable peace in Vietnam, and he will help us attain our goal of achieving in the world what Americans have not had in this century: a full generation of peace.
The people of Missouri can be proud to be represented in the United States Senate by John Danforth. And his voice and his vote will make the Senate a more effective chamber in the 1970's.
