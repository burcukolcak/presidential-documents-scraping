Remarks on Arrival at Columbus, Ohio.
WHAT a great day you have got here. I am certainly delighted to be here and be here with such a great team. This campaign is moving. That is the main thing.
I met a few of your Ohio people yesterday. The most important thing in a campaign is basically momentum--who is going in the last 2 weeks.
About a week or 2 weeks ago, it began to run. I think that this campaign in Ohio and in the Nation will be determined in the next 2 weeks. I think that I have never seen as many undecided voters in the polls that I have seen. I don't know whether it is true in this State.

The undecided voters are going to determine it. And that is why these appearances that all of us are making in the last a weeks may have some effect. I think that, in other words, what people will decide in the next 2 weeks will determine the future in all the close races.
Also, I have never seen so many close races, close races in all fields. They are real tight. That is why momentum is important. In a close race we want the momentum on our side. So let's move. Let's go.

Nice to see all of you.

I will see you downtown.
Note: The President spoke at approximately 11:45 a.m. at Port Columbus Airport.
