Letter to the Governors of the States and Territories and the Mayor of the District of Columbia on the White House Conference on Children and Youth
THE SEVENTH DECENNIAL White House Conference on Children and Youth will be convened in Washington, D.C. on December 13-16, 1970.
In the near future I shall appoint a National Chairman and a National Committee to direct the Conference.
This Conference will have a three-part emphasis and will focus upon:

1. Infants and young children from birth to age five.
2. Children from approximately six to fourteen.
3. Youth aged fourteen to twenty-one.
At this time I am asking that you take all necessary steps at your earliest convenience to fully mobilize your State in complete cooperation with the national preparation which is now under way.
It is my hope that the States, voluntary organizations, professional groups, Federal departments and agencies, and the general public, including young people, will, working together, make this Conference as successful in its results as it is significant in its meaning.
In keeping with the historic emphasis placed upon voluntary contributions to the success of the White House Conference on Children and Youth, and in keeping with this Administration's conviction of the importance of voluntarism in our national life, I urge you to call upon all relevant private voluntary organizations to lend their support and provide leadership in this undertaking.
America is a nation young at heart, and the needs of its youth are at the center of its concern. Nothing can be more important than making the coming generation the great generation.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
