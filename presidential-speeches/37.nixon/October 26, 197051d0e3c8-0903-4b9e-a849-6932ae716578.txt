Letter to the Governors of the 50 States About the Use of Low-Lead Gasoline in State Vehicles.
Dear Governor:
At my request, the Administrator of General Services today issued the attached regulation which requires that federally owned vehicles use low-lead or unleaded gasoline whenever this is practical and feasible. The purposes of this regulation are two-fold: to reduce air pollution and to increase the market for low-lead and unleaded gasoline, in order to make such fuels more generally available.
If your State would undertake a similar program, our joint action would offer the gasoline refinery and marketing industries a sizeable incentive to produce and distribute low-lead and lead-free gasoline. As the production and distribution of such fuels become widespread, the motorist will be able to buy them and thus make a major contribution to the cleaning up of our air. I hope you can join in this effort.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
