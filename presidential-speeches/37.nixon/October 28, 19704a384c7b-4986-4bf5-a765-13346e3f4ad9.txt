Statement in Support of Republican Candidates in Illinois.
RALPH Tyler Smith follows in a great Illinois tradition of distinguished Republican leaders. He came to the Senate following the sudden death of Everett McKinley Dirksen and in just 1 year he has acquired a solid reputation as a wise and able legislator.
Of course, Senator Smith is not new to the legislative process. For 15 years he served with distinction in the Illinois State legislature, and he did an outstanding job from 1967 to 1969 as speaker of the House of Representatives.
In Washington, Senator Smith stands for fiscal responsibility and against big spenders. He stands for law and order and against permissiveness. His influence was instrumental in strengthening the law enforcement legislation which recently emerged from the Congress, especially in extending Federal jurisdiction to move against campus bombings.
In the struggle for order and progress, at home and abroad, Ralph Tyler Smith is an important ally of the Nixon administration. He is a man who works with us and not against us in meeting the great issues of our time. I hope that the voters of Illinois will support Senator Smith

and the entire Republican ticket in next Tuesday's election.
