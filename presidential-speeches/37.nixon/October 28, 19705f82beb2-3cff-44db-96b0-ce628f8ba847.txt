Remarks to Overflow Crowd in Market Hall Convention Center, Dallas, Texas.
I WAS just saying to George Bush and Paul Eggers, I thought the rally was in the other room.
We want to tell you how much we appreciate all of you coming--not being able to get in--standing here and waiting for us.
I can only say that I often think that it is really service beyond the call of duty even to go and park a long way off and get into the hall. But then not to be able to sit down--to stand here like this--that has got to mean something.
I will tell you what I think it means: I think it means people care. I think it means that people are on the march. I think it means that you are going to elect two very great men, one Governor, one Senator, from the State of Texas. And I think they are right here.
I only wish that I had the chance to meet each of you individually. To give you an idea, I fly from here to Chicago tonight--not for a meeting, they have had that. But then tomorrow, it is a rather light day. I have two meetings in Illinois, one in Omaha, Nebraska, one in Rochester, Minnesota, then in San Jose, California, and then San Clemente, California.
But I am going to tell them this when I go out across the country, that in this great State of Texas, a State that has a great political tradition, that something is happening, and that on November 3d, watch Texas. It is going to be number one for our candidates.

Thank you.
Note: The President spoke at 8:25 p.m.
