Richard Nixon
October 29, 1970

Remarks to Overflow Crowd in Mayo Civic Auditorium, Rochester, Minnesota.
IF I COULD HAVE your attention for just a moment, we do appreciate your waiting in this other auditorium and listening on closed circuit.
I do say that when you come to a wonderful part of the country like Minnesota, and this heartland of the country, when people will come out in the middle of the day, as you have, and listen so attentively, it makes you very humble about the responsibilities we have.
I want you to know how grateful I am for your welcome, and particularly for the way you have received our two fine candidates.
I want to say another thing about these two candidates that I didn't say a moment ago. I like them because they are men of the future. They look to the future.
I like them because they are young men. I say young men--I know some of you are going to say anybody over 30 is old. Well, don't you believe it. I say anybody less than 50 is young.
Here we have Doug Head, a man of 40, with all that great life ahead, a man who, if elected as Govern. or, can go on to provide leadership not only to his State but to his Nation.
Here is a man, Clark MacGregor, 48 years of age. Do you realize when you elect a man like that to the United States Senate you are electing a man who can serve for four terms? And if he serves for four terms, here is a man, and I know the qualifies of the man, who can be a future majority leader of the United States Senate--Clark MacGregor.
Note: The President spoke at 1:55 p.m.
