Statement in Support of Republican Candidates in Minnesota.
MINNESOTA and the Nation need the constructive and creative leadership which Clark MacGregor and Douglas Head can provide for the 1970's.
I have known Clark MacGregor for years, and I have found him to be one of the most dedicated and hard-working Congressmen in Washington. He's a man who gets things done.
Clark MacGregor has provided a strong and thoughtful voice for peace with honor. He has been a leader on the issues of law enforcement and reform, and I was proud to have him at my side when I signed the Organized Crime Control Act, a bill he cosponsored and fought for.
Clark MacGregor will be a full-time Senator for all the people of Minnesota as together we work for a generation of peace, prosperity without inflation, and an end to crime and fear.
Douglas Head, your candidate for Governor, has already shown that he can provide outstanding leadership on the issues which will face us in the 1970's- As [State] attorney general, his strong efforts to control pollution and combat crime have helped him gain national recognition as a strong leader.
Minnesota needs men of this quality; Minnesota needs men like Douglas Head for Governor and Clark MacGregor for U.S. Senator.
