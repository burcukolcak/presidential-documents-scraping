Statement in Support of Republican Candidates in Nebraska.
DURING all the years that I have known Roman Hruska, he has provided the kind of representation and leadership that Nebraska and, indeed, the Nation need. Senator Hruska has been a clear, courageous, creative voice in our attack against the crime and violence which is threatening our Nation. He has worked diligently to help stop inflation and the large government spending that feeds it. And Senator Hruska is helping our Nation move through the difficult transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy. With men like Roman Hruska in the Senate, the voice of the people of Nebraska will continue to be heard and respected at the highest levels in Washington.
Let me also say a few words about Governor Norbert Tiemann. As America moves into the 1970's, we will need strong leaders in our States. The new federalism and this administration's emphasis on rural and area development are the kinds of initiatives which will demand from our Governors the highest kind of dedication and ability. As a proven leader in these fields, Governor Norbert Tiemann will be able to make these initiatives succeed, here in Nebraska and across the Nation as well.
Nebraska and the Nation need men like Roman Hruska and Norbert Tiemann working in public office for the good of all the people.
