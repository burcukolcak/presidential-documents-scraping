Statement About the Supreme Court Decision on Timing of School Desegregation
THE SUPREME COURT has spoken decisively on the timing of school desegregation. There are, of course, practical and human problems involved. With all of us working together in full respect for the law, I am confident we can overcome these problems.
I intend to use the leadership resources of the executive branch of Government to assist in every possible way in doing so. I call upon all citizens, and particularly those in leadership positions, to work together in seeking solutions for these problems in accordance with the mandate of the Court.
Note: The statement was read by Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler at his news briefing at 12:15 p.m. on Thursday, October 30, 1969.
The decision handed down on October 29, 1969, was in Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education (396 U.S. 19).
