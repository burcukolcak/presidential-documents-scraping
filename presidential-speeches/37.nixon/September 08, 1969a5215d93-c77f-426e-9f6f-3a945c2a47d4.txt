Remarks on Departure From Mexico.
MR. PRESIDENT, as the time comes to say goodby, we want to express our deep appreciation for the wonderful welcome you have given us on this visit to Mexico, and the warm hospitality, the wonderful entertainment, the beautiful luncheon. The words that you have spoken have only meant to us that we look forward to the time that we can return for a longer visit.
At the luncheon the President made an announcement that I think all of those here would like to hear as well. Our astronauts are going to take a trip around the world, beginning in about 2 1/2 weeks. They have been invited to most of the countries of the world, including an invitation, a very gracious invitation, from Mexico.
The President of Mexico has issued such an invitation and the first stop on their world trip will be in Mexico City on September 29 or 30.
Note: The President spoke at 5:10 p.m. at El Mirador, Coahuila, Mexico, near the Amistad Dam. He referred to Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Col. Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., USAF, and Col. Michael Collins, USAF.
