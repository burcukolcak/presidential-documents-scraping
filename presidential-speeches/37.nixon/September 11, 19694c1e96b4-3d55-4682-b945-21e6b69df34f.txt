Memorandum on the Combined Federal Campaign for the National Capital Area
Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
I am pleased to announce that the Honorable John A. Volpe, Secretary of Transportation, has agreed to serve as Chairman of this year's Combined Federal Campaign for the National Capital Area.
The Combined Federal Campaign covers in one single drive the campaigns of the United Givers Fund, the National Health Agencies, and the International Service Agencies. In this one drive Federal employees and military personnel in the Washington Metropolitan Area will have an opportunity to share in meeting the needs of over 160 local, national and international health, welfare and social service agencies.
This year, our support is needed more than ever. Citizens working together through the voluntary agencies can become partners with Government in the effort to build better communities, a healthier nation, and a more peaceful world. The voluntary organizations need the support of all Federal personnel in the National Capital Area to accomplish their important objectives. The extent to which they succeed will be a measure of our support.
I request that you serve personally as Chairman of the combined campaign in your organization and appoint a top assistant as your Vice Chairman. Please advise Secretary Volpe of the person you designate as your Vice Chairman.
RICHARD NIXON
