Proclamation 3929â€”Columbus Day, 1969

On October 12 we again celebrate in honor of the great sea captain and explorer whose historic westward voyage across the Atlantic led to the permanent settlement of America.
Respect for the achievement of Christopher Columbus is especially appropriate this year when we have witnessed an epic journey of discovery, the journey to the moon. Both the voyages of Columbus and those of our modern astronauts are expressions of man's great ambition to confront the unknown, and to master the challenges of distance and space.
We remember also that Columbus was a man of Italy, a noble example for the many other men of Italy who have come to our country and to so many other lands of the new world. Sailing in the service of the Spanish crown, which had the vision to support his courage and initiative, Christopher Columbus opened America for all the people of the world.
In tribute to the memory of Columbus, the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), requested the President to proclaim October 12 of each year as Columbus Day for the observance of the anniversary of the discovery of America.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Sunday, October 12, 1969, as Columbus Day; and I invite the people of this nation to observe that day in schools, churches, and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the great explorer.
I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in memory of Christopher Columbus.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
