Remarks on Signing the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1969.
BEFORE this bill-signing ceremony, I want to congratulate the Members of the House and Senate who have provided the leadership for the passage of this legislation.
These amendments to the Older Americans Act will further the objective that we are all very interested in, and that is of providing more useful and constructive lives for the 20 million Americans over 65 years of age.
I think, also, this is a very appropriate time to announce that next week I shall send to the Congress a message asking for an increase in social security benefits of 10 percent, effective April 1.
This is a matter of simple justice for those living on social security, because as we look at the record of rising costs over the past 5 years, those who have suffered most are our older citizens who are living on fixed incomes.
I know that all of those Members of the Senate and House who have worked with this legislation will provide the leadership for quick passage of the social security increase.
Note: The President spoke at 11:55 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. As enacted, the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1969 is Public Law 91-69 (83 Stat. 108).
