Proclamation 4004â€”Columbus Day, 1970

On Columbus Day, 1970, we celebrate once more the historic achievement of the great Italian navigator and explorer whose vision, courage and skill led to the enduring settlement of the new world by the peoples of the old.
Sailing in the service of the Spanish Crown, Christopher Columbus established the first permanent European colony in the Americas, and heralded the great migration of peoples to this hemisphere. Many men and women have come and settled here from Italy, the native land of the great Captain, as so many others have come and settled from places throughout the world.
In the United States we are justly proud to count ourselves heirs to the spirit and determination of Christopher Columbus. We rightly honor the memory of that indomitable faith which sustained him on his historic voyages and resulted in the development of this great nation of ours.
In tribute to the achievement of Columbus, the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), requested the President to proclaim October 12 of each year as Columbus Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 12, 1970, as Columbus Day; and I invite the people of this nation to observe that day in schools, churches, and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the great explorer.
I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in memory of Christopher Columbus.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand, this eighteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fifth.
