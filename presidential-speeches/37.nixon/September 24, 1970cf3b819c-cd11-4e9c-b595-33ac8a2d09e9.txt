Message to the Senate Transmitting the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services to Which Trademarks are Applied
To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to accession, I transmit herewith a certified copy of the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services to which Trademarks are Applied, signed June 15, 1957, together with an English translation thereof, and a certified copy of that Agreement as revised at Stockholm July 14, 1967, together with an English translation thereof. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State with respect to the Agreements.
The organization set up by the Agreement is responsible for establishing an international classification of trademarks used in over 60 countries. It is important from the standpoint of the interest of trademark owners and from the standpoint of effective government administration of its trademark functions that the United States accede to the Agreements so that it may participate as a member in the organization.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Agreements submitted herewith and give its advice and consent to accession.
