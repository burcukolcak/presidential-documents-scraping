Proclamation 4010â€”National School Lunch Week, 1970

For 24 years the National School Lunch Program has been working to improve the nutrition of our school children. Last May, I signed into law amendments to the National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act which will assist in reaching our goal of assuring that every needy child receives a school lunch, free or at reduced cost, and that every school child has access to a moderately priced school meal.
The School Lunch Program has always been an example of Federal, State, and local cooperation. To call attention to the Program's value and achievements, the Congress by a joint resolution of October 9, 1962, designated the week beginning on the second Sunday of October in each year as National School Lunch Week, and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of that week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,President of the United States of America, call upon the people of the United States to observe the week beginning October 11, 1970, as National School Lunch Week, with ceremonies and activities designed to foster public knowledge and mutual comprehension of the value of the National School Lunch Program to our children and the Nation as a whole.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fifth.
