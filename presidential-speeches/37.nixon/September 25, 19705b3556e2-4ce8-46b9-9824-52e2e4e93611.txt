Proclamation 4008â€”National Day of Prayer, 1970

"Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace."
This ancient prayer has never been more timely than in our own day. It reminds us in striking fashion that the path to peace is through the hearts of men, and it seeks a particularly noble reward: the ability to examine one's own role in bringing harmony and tranquility to others.
Faith in God and reliance upon his help are among our most important traditions. In recognition of the place of prayer in our national life, the Congress in 1952 provided that the President proclaim a suitable day other than a Sunday each year as a National Day of Prayer.
In complying with the directive of the Congress, I invite all Americans to pray that the scourge of war be lifted from the earth, and that the anguish of those who have felt the horrors of war be eased. It is especially fitting this year that our people ask God's blessings for each other and for all men.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, October 21, as National Day of Prayer, 1970. I call upon all Americans to join hearts and minds on this day in prayers for reconciliation and brotherhood among our people and for lasting peace with justice.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this 25th day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fifth.


RICHARD NIXON
