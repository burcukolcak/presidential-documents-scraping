Proclamation 4007â€”Country Music Month, 1970

Deep from the heart of America, country music has come to enrich the daily lives of countless citizens. Its warmth is the warmth of the hearth and the heart. Its simplicity expresses the candor, the humor, the love and the pain of country people. Its unique and varied melodies are vivid portrayals of men and women whose experiences have taught them that life brings blessings and hardships, joys and sorrows, satisfactions and anxieties.
The popularity and growth of country music in recent years attest to its increasingly important part in American life.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,President of the United States of America, ask the people of this nation to mark the month of October with suitable observances as Country Music Month.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fifth.
