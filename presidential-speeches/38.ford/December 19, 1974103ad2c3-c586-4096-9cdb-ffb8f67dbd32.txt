Statement on the Confirmation of Nelson A. Rockefeller To Be Vice President of the United States.
I AM delighted that Nelson Rockefeller has been duly confirmed today to be the 41st Vice President of the United States. I congratulate him and look forward to his participation and assistance in the Administration.
I commend the House of Representatives for its confirmation vote today and the Senate for its vote earlier. Members of the 93d Congress have rendered a service to the Nation by filling the constitutional office of the Vice President before adjournment. All Americans will benefit from the distinguished and devoted public service of the new Vice President.
Note: Following the confirmation vote in the House of Representatives on the evening of December 19, 1974, the President and Mrs. Ford accompanied Governor and Mrs. Rockefeller to the Senate Chamber at the Capitol where Governor Rockefeller took the oath of office as Vice President.
