Remarks at a Ceremony Marking the Retirement of Gen. Andrew J. Goodpaster as Supreme Allied Commander, Europe.
LET ME just say I have known General Goodpaster, well, I guess, since 1951 or thereabouts, and all of you know better than I his long and distinguished record, 35 years or more in the military, a wide variety of commands and responsibilities.
Somebody told me that you were a real triple threat operator in the services, General, and as I looked at the record I am very, very impressed with that broad area of responsibility and achievement.

I certainly congratulate you on this fine, fine record.
Those who have served with you in the military of course know infinitely better than I the things that you have done and the achievements that you have accomplished. And I share with them the pride that I have as Commander in Chief. And I can assure you that we look upon people such as yourself as the epitome of achievement in the military, representing all of us who are civilian.
And I congratulate the services. And I congratulate you. And I thank your wife and family for, I am sure, the many hours that you were gone, and the difficulties they had in holding the fort, so to speak, while you were serving your country.

And I congratulate you, and thank you, and wish you the very, very best.
Note: The President spoke at 12:45 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House before presenting the Defense Distinguished Service Medal to General Goodpaster. General Goodpaster had served as Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, since May 1969.
