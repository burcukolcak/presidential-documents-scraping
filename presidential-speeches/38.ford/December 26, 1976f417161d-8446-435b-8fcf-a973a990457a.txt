Statement on the Death of Senator Philip A. Hart of Michigan.
I LEARNED with deep regret this afternoon of the passing of Senator Phil Hart. Senator Hart served the people of Michigan and the Nation with great distinction. He will be missed.
Mrs. Ford and I extend our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Hart and to their children.
Note: Senator Hart was a Member of Congress from 1958 until his death.
The statement was released at Vail, Colo.
