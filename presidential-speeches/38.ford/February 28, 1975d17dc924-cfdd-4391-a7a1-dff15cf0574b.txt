Statement Announcing Final Extension of the Program for the Return of Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Military Deserters
ON January 30, 1975, I extended until March 1 the termination date of applications under the clemency program for draft evaders and military absentees who have charges still pending against them and for those who already have been punished for such offenses.
Based on a further review of the progress of this program, I believe that many of those who have already been punished are only now learning they are eligible. This is confirmed by the large number of applications--already exceeding 10,000--which continue to be filed with the Presidential Clemency Board.
Therefore, I am today granting a final extension of the termination date for applications under the clemency program from March 1 until March 31, 1975.
Note: On the same day, the President signed Proclamation 4353 and Executive Order 11842, extending the application period for the clemency program.
