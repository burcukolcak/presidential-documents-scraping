Statement on the Death of Representative John C. Kluczynski of Illinois.
I WAS grieved to learn today of the death of a veteran and respected Member of the House of Representatives. It was my privilege to work with John Kluczynski as a colleague for 23 years. I know how much he loved his work and how well he did his job.
As chairman of the Public Works Subcommittee on Transportation, John helped to shape our interstate highway system--an achievement in which he took special pride.
He was a conscientious, hard-working public servant, who served both his party and his country well. Mrs. Ford and I join with his many friends in extending our sympathy to his wife, Estelle, on her bereavement.
Note: Representative Kluczynski was a Member of Congress from 1951 until his death on January 26, 1975.
