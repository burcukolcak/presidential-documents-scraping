Letter to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel on the Israeli Rescue of Hostages in Uganda.
Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
The American people join me in expressing our great satisfaction that the passengers of the Air France flight seized earlier this week have been saved and a senseless act of terrorism thwarted.

Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
Note: The Air France airbus was hijacked by terrorists on June 28 after it left Athens on a Paris-bound flight which originated in Israel. The passengers and crew were held hostage in Uganda until rescued by an Israeli commando unit on July 3.
