Gerald R. Ford
July 29, 1975

Remarks on Arrival at Helsinki, Finland.
President Kekkonen, ladies and gentlemen:
Mrs. Ford and our son Jack join me in expressing our very great pleasure in being in Finland on this occasion. I extend to the Finnish Government and to the Finnish people the warm friendship and the warm admiration of the United States and all Americans.
Finland is a most appropriate host for this final stage of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. I join the other participants so that together we will take another step in the building of a peaceful, cooperative, and mutually beneficial relationship among all of the countries of Europe.
This meeting in Helsinki can give new impetus to the process of detente. The provisions of the document we will sign must be translated into policies and action by the participating states if we are to realize the promises of greater security and cooperation in Europe.
The United States will participate fully in this process. American security and well-being are tied to the security and to the stability of Europe.
While our agenda for the next few days will be full, Mr. President, I look forward with pleasure to seeing you and enjoying the renowned hospitality of Helsinki and Finland.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 6:18 p.m. at Seutula Airport in response to remarks of welcome by Finnish President Urho Kekkonen.
Later that evening, the President paid a courtesy call on President Kekkonen at the President's Palace:
