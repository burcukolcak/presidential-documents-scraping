Statement on the Death of Former Prime Minister Eisaku Sato of Japan.
I WAS deeply saddened to learn of the death of Eisaku Sato. The passing of this great statesman, Nobel laureate, who did so much for his nation and for the cause of peace, is a loss to the world. His service as Prime Minister of Japan won the respect of all nations; his counsel was sought and valued. He was a close friend of the American people and devoted his life to strengthening the ties of understanding and friendship between the United States and Japan. I speak on behalf of all Americans in expressing our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Sato and the Japanese people.
Note: Eisaku Sato was Prime Minister of Japan from 1964 to 1972. The statement was released at Rome, Italy.
Ambassador at Large U. Alexis Johnson headed the U.S. delegation to the funeral of former Prime Minister Sato in Tokyo on June 16, 1975.
