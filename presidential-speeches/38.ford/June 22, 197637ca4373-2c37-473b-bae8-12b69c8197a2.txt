Letter to Congressional Committee Chairmen Transmitting Report on the Status of Indochina Refugees.
Dear Mr. Chairman:
In accordance with the provisions of the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975, I am reporting to you on the status of refugees from Cambodia and South Vietnam.
As this and my previous four reports show, remarkable progress has been made in the resettlement of the Indochina refugees since my April 18, 1975 establishment of a Federal program. Some 130,000 refugees were evacuated from Indochina and resettled in the United States before the end of calendar year 1975. The task of providing the Indochina refugee the assistance necessary to his becoming a self-reliant member of his new community has begun and continues. Many refugees have already successfully made the transition into American life. Substantial numbers, however, require financial, medical or educational assistance and this is being provided through private and public efforts.
Knowing the hopes and aspirations of these newcomers to our country and the demonstrated support of the American people, I am confident that progress will continue to be made.

Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
