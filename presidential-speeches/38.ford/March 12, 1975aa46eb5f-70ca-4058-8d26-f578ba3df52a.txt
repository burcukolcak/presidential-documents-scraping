Letter Accepting the Resignation of Deputy Attorney General Laurence H. Silberman.
Dear Larry:
I have your letter of February 21, and it is with deepest regret that I accept your resignation as Deputy Attorney General, effective upon the appointment and qualification of your successor, as you requested.
In doing so, I want to take this opportunity to express my personal appreciation for your dedicated service to our Nation and to my Administration. Throughout your career in government, you have brought to each of your many challenging responsibilities great energy, skill and high professional integrity. I have had many occasions, particularly during this past difficult period of transition, to admire these qualities and to seek your valued counsel. Your devotion to the proper administration of justice throughout our land, and your significant contributions to the operations of the Department of Justice have earned the gratitude of all your fellow citizens and my own deep respect.
Betty joins me in extending to Ricki and you our warmest good wishes for the future.

Sincerely,

JERRY FORD
