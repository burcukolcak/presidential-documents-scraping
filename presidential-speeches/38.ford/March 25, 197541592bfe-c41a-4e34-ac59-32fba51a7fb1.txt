Statement on the Death of King Faisal Ibn Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia.
IT WAS with the deepest sorrow that I learned of the tragic death of His Majesty King Faisal, a close friend of the United States and a leader who achieved so much for his people and those of the Arab world and Islam and whose wisdom and stature earned the respect of the entire world. On behalf of the American people, I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to the Royal Family and to the people of Saudi Arabia, whose grief we share.
Note: King Faisal was assassinated by his nephew, Prince Faisal Ibn Musaid Abdul Aziz, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on March 25, 1975. Vice President Rockefeller left for Saudi Arabia on the evening of March 25 to express the President's condolences to Crown Prince Khalid, King Faisal's successor.
