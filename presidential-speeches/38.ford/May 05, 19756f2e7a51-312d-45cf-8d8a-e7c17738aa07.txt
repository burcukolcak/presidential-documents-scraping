Remarks Upon Presenting the Multiple Sclerosis Mother and Father of the Year Awards
LET ME, on behalf of the White House and all of the American people, give to you, Mrs. Smith and Mr. Flader, these two plaques from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, plaques which recognize your courage and your real strength.
I think you both are a great symbol of what people can do despite difficulties and handicaps. We are all very proud of you, and we all are extending to you the very, very best.
I hope and trust that in the years ahead your example will be one for all to follow.
Note: The President spoke at 1 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. He presented the awards to Mrs. Merrill Smith of Spokane, Wash., and Robert Flader of Virginia Beach, Va.
