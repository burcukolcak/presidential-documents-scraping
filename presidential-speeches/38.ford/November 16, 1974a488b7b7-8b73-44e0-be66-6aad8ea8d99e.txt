Proclamation 4335—Imports of Meat From Canada

TEMPORARY QUANTITATIVE LIMITATION ON THE IMPORTATION INTO THE UNITED STATES OF CERTAIN CATTLE, BEEF, VEAL, SWINE AND PORK FROM CANADA
Whereas,Section 252 (a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1882 (a)) authorizes the President to impose duties or other import restrictions on the products of any foreign country establishing or maintaining unjustifiable import restrictions against United States agricultural products which impair the value of tariff commitments made to the United States, oppress the commerce of the United States, or prevent the expansion of trade on a mutually advantageous basis;
Whereas,Canada has imposed unjustifiable restrictions on cattle and meat imports from the United States;
Whereas,such restrictions violate the commitments of Canada made to the United States, including the provisions of Article XI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and impair the value of tariff commitments made to the United States, oppress the commerce of the United States and prevent the expansion of trade on a mutually advantageous basis; and
Whereas,I deem it necessary and appropriate to impose the restrictions hereinafter proclaimed on imports of cattle, beef, veal, swine, and pork, which are the products of Canada, in order to obtain the removal of such unjustifiable restrictions and to provide access for United States cattle and meat to the markets of Canada on an equitable basis;
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes, including Section 252 (a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1882(a)), do hereby proclaim (until such time as the President otherwise proclaims)
(1) Subpart B of part 2 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) is amended by inserting in numerical sequence the following new items:
(2)      Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) hereof, not in excess of one-twelfth of the respective quota quantity specified for each item in said paragraph (1) may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the 30-day period beginning on the date of this proclamation.
(3)      The provisions of this proclamation shall become effective upon publication in the Federal Register, but the provisions of paragraph (1) hereof do not apply to any articles in excess of the respective quota quantity specified for each item in said paragraph (1) which‑
(a) prior to such date of publication, have been duly entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption or have been released under the provisions of section 448 (b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1448 (b)), or
(b) have been entered or withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (2) hereof.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth.
