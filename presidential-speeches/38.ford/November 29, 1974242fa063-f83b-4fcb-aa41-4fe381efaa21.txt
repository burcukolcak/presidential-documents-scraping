Gerald R. Ford
November 29, 1974

Letter Accepting the Resignation of William S. Whitehead as Chairman of the Renegotiation Board.
Dear Bill:
I have your letter of November 29, and I will, of course, accept your resignation as Chairman of the Renegotiation Board, effective December 1, 1974.
The last five years have been difficult and challenging ones for you, and I want you to know that I fully understand the considerations which prompted your decision to resign the Chairmanship prior to your resignation as a member. The Renegotiation Board has a most important and vital role in government, and it is my intention to reinvigorate the Board so as to expand its role in the fight against inflation.
You have my sincere thanks and deep appreciation for your years of service to our Nation. Please know that you take with you my very best wishes for every happiness and success in the years ahead.

Sincerely,
JERRY FORD

[The Honorable William Scholl Whitehead, Chairman, Renegotiation Board, Washington, D.C. 20446]
Note: Mr. Whitehead's letter of resignation, released with the President's letter, read as follows:
Dear Mr. President:
It is respectfully requested that I be relieved from the duties as Chairman and activities as a Member of this Agency, effective December 1, 1974. Under such an arrangement I would, however, expect to utilize my present facilities at the Board for purposes of putting my affairs in order until my retirement, on December 31, 1974.
The basic reason for the above request is that the Board is about to become involved in the determination of several major policy areas. Under the circumstances, I believe the continuing Members should have a free hand in making these decisions during this last phase of my transitional period.
Sincerely,
W. S. WHITEHEAD Chairman
[The President, The White House]
