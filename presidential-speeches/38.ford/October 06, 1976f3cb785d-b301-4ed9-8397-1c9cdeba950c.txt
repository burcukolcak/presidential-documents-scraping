Exchange With Reporters Following the Presidential Campaign Debate in San Francisco.
REPORTER. Mr. President, could you tell us who you talked with since you came home?
THE PRESIDENT. I talked to my wonderful wife and to Secretary Kissinger.
Q. Well, what did they have to say to you?
THE PRESIDENT. They all thought we did quite well.
Q. They think you won it?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, they are a little prejudiced, but I think they were optimistic about the outcome of it.
Q. What did Secretary Kissinger have to say? Anything specific about how the debate had gone with this subject?
THE PRESIDENT. He just felt that we had taken the offensive and we had talked affirmatively about our successes. That was the truth, so he was very pleased.
Q. Do you agree with Mrs. Ford and the Secretary that you won it?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I don't disagree with my wife very often, so on this occasion I will agree with her, as I do on most.

REPORTER. Thank you, Mr. President.
Note: The exchange began at 8:36 p.m. at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. John Sutro, where the President stayed during his visit to San Francisco.
