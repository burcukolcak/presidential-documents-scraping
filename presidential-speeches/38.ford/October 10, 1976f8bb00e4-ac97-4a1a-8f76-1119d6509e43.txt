Statement on Signing the Arts, Humanities, and Cultural Affairs Act of 1976.
I AM pleased today to sign H.R. 12838 authorizing the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities to continue and expand its work through 1980. The Arts, Humanities, and Cultural Affairs Act of 1976 reflects the continuing strong bipartisan support of the programs of the National Endowments for the Arts and for the Humanities.
I have supported the Foundation continuously, both as a Congressman and since I became President. The support of the arts and humanities provided by the Federal Government has permitted a marked increase in individual participation in, and support of, a wide range of cultural activities.
In striving to make America's third century the century of the individual, the Foundation should play a leadership role in improving the quality of life throughout the Nation. I take great pride in signing this legislation in reaffirmation of that strong commitment of my administration.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 12838, approved October 8, 1976, is Public Law 94-462 (90 Stat. 1971).The statement was released at Dallas, Tex.
