Remarks on Signing a Drug Abuse Prevention Week Proclamation.
I AM ABOUT to sign the Drug Abuse Prevention Week proclamation [4328], and I will sign it in the presence of these three very important members of the team that gives leadership to our effort in trying to handle the entry of drugs from outside of the country, the handling of those who abuse our laws as far as drugs are concerned, and the problem of trying to, through research, find answers to the drug problem in advance.
So, on this occasion, it is a privilege for me to sign this proclamation, which I hope will have an impact on our very sizable effort of about $750 million a year in meeting the challenge of the drug problem in the United States.

Thank you very much, gentlemen.
Note: The President spoke at 2:45 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House. Present at the signing ceremony were Ambassador Sheldon B. Vance, Senior Adviser to the Secretary of State and Coordinator for International Narcotics Matters; Dr. Robert L. DuPont, Director of the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention; and John R. Bartels, Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice.
Following the signing ceremony, the participants met with the President to discuss current Government efforts to control drug abuse through treatment, law enforcement, and international incentives.
