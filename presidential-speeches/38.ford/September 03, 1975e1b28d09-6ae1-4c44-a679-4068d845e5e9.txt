Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate Transmitting Proposal for United States Participation in an Early Warning System in the Sinai Peninsula
[Dated September 2, 1975. Released September 3, 1975]
I AM enclosing for the immediate information of the Congress, the text of a proposal to be signed by the President of Egypt regarding the terms under which American civilian personnel could play a role in connection with an early warning system in the buffer zone between the Egyptian and Israeli forces in the Sinai.
A similar proposal will be signed by the Prime Minister of Israel. The text of that document is also enclosed. I intend to request formally that Congress approve this document. I would appreciate your views on the form which this approval should take. As soon as the official texts of the other documents related to the Egypt-Israel agreement initialed on September 1st have been signed by the parties in Geneva, I will be making a formal transmission of the texts of the agreement and related documents for the information of the Congress.

Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
