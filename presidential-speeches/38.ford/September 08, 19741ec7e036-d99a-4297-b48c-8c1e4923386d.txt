Statement on the Resignation of J. F. terHorst as Press Secretary to the President.
I DEEPLY regret Jerry terHorst's resignation. I understand his position. I appreciate the fact that good people will differ with me on this very difficult decision. However, it is my judgment that it is in the best interest of our country. I think Jerry did an outstanding job in a controversial period of transition. I thank him for his service.
Note: The statement was issued by the White House.
Regarding his decision to resign as a result of the President's pardon of Richard Nixon, news accounts quoted Mr. terHorst as saying, "It was simply after a great deal of soul-searching that I decided I couldn't in good conscience support the President's decision on former President Nixon, even though I knew he took that action in good conscience."
