Calhoun, Georgia Informal Remarks With Reporters at the First Baptist Church.
REPORTER. Has it been a happy Easter for you?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, we've enjoyed it; feel at home.
Q. Did you hear about the Russian trawler being seized?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Q. Was that under your orders, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, we released several of them, and we just had to draw the line somewhere. We informed the Soviet Embassy this past week that we couldn't continue to release them, that we had to enforce the law.

REPORTER. Thank you, Mr. President.
Note: The President spoke at 12:10 p.m. outside the church where he attended Easter Sunday services.
Earlier in the day, the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Decisive had seized the Soviet fishing vessel Taras Shevchenko for an alleged violation of the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976.
