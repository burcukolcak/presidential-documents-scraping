Death of Rogers C. B. Morton Statement by the President. 
Americans who care about conservation and the environment have lost a champion with the death of Rogers C. 13. Morton. He fought gallantly for the outdoors he cherished. In Congress, in the Cabinet, and in politics he was both an ardent partisan and a perfect gentleman. His spirit, courage, and humor enhanced our public life and will be greatly missed.
Note: Mr. Morton served as Secretary of the Interior during the Nixon administration and as Secretary of Commerce during the Ford administration. He had also been chairman of the Republican National Committee and a U.S. Representative from Maryland.
