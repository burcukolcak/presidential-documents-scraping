Archbishop Makarios III Statement on the Death of the President of Cyprus.
I was greatly saddened to learn of the untimely death of President Makarios. His passing deprives the Republic of Cyprus and the world of a great statesman. We share the sorrow of the people of Cyprus over the loss of a man whose many years as leader of the Cypriot nation have left such a deep mark on history.
Note: Archbishop Makarios became President of the Republic of Cyprus in 1959.
Press Secretary Jody Powell read the statement at his August 3 news conference at the White House. It was not issued in the form of a White House press release.
