National Aeronautics and Space Programs Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report. 
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit this report on the Nation's progress in space and aeronautics during 1978. This report is provided in accordance with Section 206 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 as amended (42 U.S.C. 2476).
Included in this report are statements of policy designed to maintain American space leadership. This report concentrates on the most significant Federal space and aeronautical activities. These emphases have enabled us to reduce the amount of detail and number of separate agency program descriptions.
