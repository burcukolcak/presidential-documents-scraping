First Transatlantic Balloon Crossing Telegram to the Three Balloonists on Their Successful Crossing. 
On behalf of all the American people, I salute your triumphant adventure. Your daring voyage through the silent sky is a welcome reminder that individual acts of bravery and skill still capture our collective imagination.
I wish to invite you to visit with me in the White House once you've returned to this country.
We all celebrate your magnificent achievement and welcome you warmly back to the earth.
JIMMY CARTER
Note: The telegram was addressed to Ben Abruzzo, Max Anderson, and Larry Newman, and was delivered to them after they landed their hot-air balloon, Double Eagle II, near Miserey, France.
