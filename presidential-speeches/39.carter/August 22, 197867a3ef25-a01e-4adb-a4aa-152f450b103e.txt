Congressional Representation for the District of Columbia Statement Following Senate Passage of the Proposed Constitutional Amendment. 
I congratulate the Senate on its historic vote this evening. I particularly want to commend Senators Byrd and Kennedy, as well as Delegate Fauntroy, for their tireless efforts to pass the proposed constitutional amendment giving District of Columbia citizens full voting representation in Congress.
Because of today's vote, and the House's favorable vote earlier this year, we are at long last on the verge of giving District citizens the representation that they deserve and that simple justice demands.
The ratification process for every constitutional amendment is naturally difficult and time-consuming. But we cannot let this opportunity to ensure human rights at home slip away. I therefore urge the States to ratify this proposed amendment as promptly as possible.
Note: Earlier, the Senate had passed H.J. Res. 554 by a vote of 67 to 32.
