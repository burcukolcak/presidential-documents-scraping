Cahaba River in Alabama Message to the Congress Transmitting a Study. 
To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (Public Law 90-542, as amended), I am transmitting the attached study of the feasibility of adding the Cahaba River in Alabama to the national Wild and Scenic Rivers system. Although the study finds that the river does not possess the qualities to be eligible to be added to the national system, the State of Alabama has initiated efforts to manage the river to protect its attributes, including its recreational qualities.
