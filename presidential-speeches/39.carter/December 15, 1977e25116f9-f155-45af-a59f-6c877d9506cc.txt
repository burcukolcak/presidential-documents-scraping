Budget Deferrals Message to the Congress.
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, I herewith report three new International security assistance deferrals totalling $806.4 million in budget authority and one new deferral of $3.4 million in outlays for the Antirecession financial assistance fund in the Department of the Treasury.
In addition, I am reporting routine revisions to four deferrals previously transmitted. A deferral for the Emergency refugee and migration assistance fund is increased by $5.8 million in budget authority. Three deferrals of funds provided to the Department of the Treasury are increased by a total of $13.3 million of which $11.9 million is deferred budget authority and $1.3 million is an increase to a deferral which only affects outlays.
The details of each deferral are contained in the attached reports.
