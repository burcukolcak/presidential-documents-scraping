Initial Fuel Assurances Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report. 
To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to Section 104(b) of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978, enclosed is a report on Preliminary Proposals on Initial Fuel Assurances.
As indicated in the report, we are continuing our assessment of alternative fuel assurances schemes and will inform you of any proposals as these assessments are concluded. The current alternatives envision uranium stockpiles with size ranges between 2 million and 10 million separative work units. Present estimates of the cost for these program alternatives, based on the current market value of the uranium fuel and the enrichment services, are approximately a half billion to more than 2 billion dollars.
