Import Relief for the Anhydrous Ammonia Industry Letter to the Chairman of the United States International Trade Commission. 
Dear Madam Chairman:
Pursuant to section 406 (c) of the Trade Act of 1974, I have today found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that market disruption exists with respect to imports of anhydrous ammonia, provided for in items 417.22 and 480.65 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States, from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I therefore request that you initiate an investigation on such articles under section 406(a) of the Trade Act of 1974.

Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[The Honorable Catherine M. Bedell, Chairman, International Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20436]
