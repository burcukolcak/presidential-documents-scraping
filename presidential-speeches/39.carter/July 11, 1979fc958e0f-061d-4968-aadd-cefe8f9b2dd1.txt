Skylab Message to Australian Prime Minister J. Malcolm Fraser. 
I was concerned to learn that fragments of Skylab may have landed in Australia. I am relieved to hear your Government's preliminary assessment that no injuries have resulted. Nevertheless, I have instructed the Department of State to be in touch with your Government immediately and to offer any assistance you may need.
Note: Skylab was launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on May 14, 1973. The orbiting spacecraft, weighing approximately 77 tons, was used as a research observatory workshop.
On reentering the Earth's atmosphere, Skylab disintegrated, and about two-thirds of the debris burned up during its descent. The remaining pieces were scattered over the Indian Ocean and Australia in an estimated 100-milewide, 4,000-mile-long path.
