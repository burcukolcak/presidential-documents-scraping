Bonn Economic Summit Conference Informal Exchange With Reporters. 
Q. Mr. President, are you going to be discussing Berlin this morning, with the protest?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, we'll be discussing Berlin this morning.

THE PRESIDENT. We have enough problems and opportunities; we're not looking for new ones.

THE PRESIDENT. Very good, yes.
Q. Can the fellows really do anything about terrorism in what they bring forth today?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
