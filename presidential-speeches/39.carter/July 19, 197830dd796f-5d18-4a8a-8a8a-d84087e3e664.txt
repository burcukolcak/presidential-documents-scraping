Federal Civil Service Reorganization Statement on the House Government Operations Committee's Action on Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978. 
I wish to express my appreciation for the House Government Operations Committee's vote today on the civil service reorganization plan. I especially want to thank Committee Chairman Jack Brooks for his leadership. The 31-0 committee vote count reflects the strong bipartisan support for my civil service reforms.
I look forward to the reorganization plan's becoming effective, and to the passage by Congress of the companion civil service legislation.
