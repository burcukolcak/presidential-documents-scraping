Memorandum From the President on the Combined Federal Campaign
Memorandum for All Federal Employees and Military Personnel
America's character and tradition are deeply rooted in a spirit of neighborliness, of people banding together to do the things they see must be done.
Through the Combined Federal Campaign, Federal employees can show their individual concern for those who need help. This is an opportunity that comes only in a free society.
The Combined Federal Campaign covers in one single drive the campaigns of the United Way, the National Health Agencies, the International Service Agencies, the National Service Agencies and local non-federated voluntary agencies. These agencies help make our world a better place in which to live. They reflect the complex and dynamic vitality of American life, the traditional concern of the American people for the unfortunate, and the genius for voluntary service that has long been our pride and our strength.
The Combined Federal Campaign is a fine vehicle for expressing the American tradition of neighborliness and service. Let me urge you to continue this tradition through your contributions to the Combined Federal Campaign.
JIMMY CARTER
