Status of Indochina Refugees - Letter to Senate and House Committee Chairmen Transmitting a Report
In accordance with the provisions of the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975, I am reporting to you on the status of refugees from Cambodia and South Vietnam.
We continue to make progress in assisting the Indochina refugee to become a self-sufficient member of his new community. Refugee employment rates are very encouraging. Income levels, however, are low and income supplementation through cash assistance programs is relatively high. Professional certification, English language proficiency, and the development of marketable job skills are approaches being used to improve the employment position of the refugee. Passage of legislation to adjust refugee immigration status from parolee to permanent resident alien will assist in opening new employment and educational opportunities for the refugee.
I want to thank the many individual families and public and private institutions that contribute so generously to this program. With their assistance, we draw near to a successful conclusion of this humanitarian effort.
Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
