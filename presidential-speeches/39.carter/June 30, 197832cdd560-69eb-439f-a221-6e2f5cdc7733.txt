Memorandum From the President on the Combined Federal Campaign
Memorandum for Federal Employees and Military Personnel
Ours is a society in which individuals traditionally share what they have with others less fortunate than themselves. The Combined Federal Campaign offers each of us the opportunity to show our individual concern for those in need of help. This one campaign combines the fundraising efforts of the local United Way, the American Red Cross, the National Health Agencies, and the International Services Agencies.
Through one gift to the Combined Federal Campaign, we can help support a wide variety of voluntary agencies. These organizations support the sick, the aged, the handicapped, the poverty-stricken and the youngâ€”those who are needy among us. Your contributions also go towards research programs and our friends in need across the seas. If you choose, your gift can be made easier through the use of payroll deductions.
While the decision to give and the amount of one's gift are, of course, personal voluntary decisions, I hope that each of you will join with me and other federal workers, civilian and military, in supporting your local Combined Federal Campaign to the fullest extent possible.
JIMMY CARTER
