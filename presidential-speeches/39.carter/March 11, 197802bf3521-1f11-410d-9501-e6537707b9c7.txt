Terrorist Attack in Israel Statement by the President. 
The terrorist attack on a bus today in Israel was an outrageous act of lawlessness and senseless brutality. Criminal acts such as this advance no cause or political belief. They inspire only revulsion at the lack of respect for innocent human life.
Note: Members of the Palestinian guerrilla organization Al Fatah seized a sightseeing bus north of Tel Aviv and forced it south. They were stopped by Israeli security forces in Herzliya. In the aftermath of the attack, 35 Israelis and 9 of the terrorists were dead.
