Aldo Moro Letter to President Giovanni Leone of Italy on the Kidnapping of the Former Italian Prime Minister. 
Dear Mr. President:
I was shocked to hear of the terrorist kidnapping of Aldo Moro. I know that millions of Americans join me in praying for his quick and safe return. This outrage deeply affects all of us. Please convey my personal sympathies to the Moro family and to the families of the brave men slain in the line of duty in this senseless terrorist attack.

Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
Note: Former Prime Minister Moro was abducted in Rome en route from his home to a meeting of the Italian Parliament by members of the Red Brigades, an Italian terrorist group. His bodyguards were slain during the incident.
