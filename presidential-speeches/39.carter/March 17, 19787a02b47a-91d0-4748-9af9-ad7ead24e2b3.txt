Labor Disputes in the Coal Industry Statement Issued Following a District Court Denial To Extend the Temporary Restraining Order. 
The court decision shows that the country has responded well in dealing with the effects of the coal strike. We have had some success in moving coal, and the Taft-Hartley temporary restraining order has aided in opening up hundreds of coal mines.
The judge has found that as of now a national emergency no longer exists. Another hearing will be held on March 28.
I continue to hope that the collective bargaining process will be successful and bring about an end to the strike. We will be monitoring coal shipments closely and will be prepared to seek a permanent injunction at the March 28 hearing if a negotiated settlement has not been reached by that time.
Note: The statement was released at Savannah, Ga.
