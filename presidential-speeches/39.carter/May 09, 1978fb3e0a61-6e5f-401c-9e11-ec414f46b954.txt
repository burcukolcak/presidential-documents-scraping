Aldo Moro Statement on the Death of the Former Italian Prime Minister. 
My sympathies and the sympathies of all Americans go out to Aldo Moro's bereaved family and nation.
His murder is a contemptible and cowardly act. His death advances no cause but that of mindless anarchy. But his life was devoted to building his nation, and his political skills were forever at the service of justice.
He stood for civilization and the rule of law, principles which will always outlive the terrorism that seeks to destroy them.
Note: Mr. Moro's body was recovered in central Rome following his murder by members of the Red Brigades, an Italian terrorist organization. The terrorists had abducted him on March 16.
The White House announced that the President sent personal messages of condolence to Mrs. Moro, President Giovanni Leone of Italy, and Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti.
