Sir Robert Menzies Statement on the Death of the Former Australian Prime Minister. 
In the death of Sir Robert Menzies, the United States has lost a firm friend and Australia a great leader.
Sir Robert's career of public service began half a century ago. He stood by the United States in three wars, and was instrumental in establishing the Australia-New Zealand-United States alliance (ANZUS).
After his retirement from public life, he continued to work at strengthening the ties of friendship that bind our countries-serving for a year as scholar-in-residence at the University of Virginia.
I join with Sir Robert's family and nation in mourning his passing.
Note: The White House later announced that the President asked Governor and Mrs. W. Averell Harriman to be his personal representatives at the funeral services in Melbourne on May 19.
