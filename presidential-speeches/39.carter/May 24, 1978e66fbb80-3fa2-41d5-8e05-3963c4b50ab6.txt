National Commission on the International Year of the Child, 1979 Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate Transmitting Proposed Legislation. 
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am transmitting today a bill to provide for a National Commission on the International Year of the Child, 1979.
Enactment of this legislation will enable the United States to participate fully in celebrating 1979 as the International Year of the Child, which was designated by the United Nations General Assembly by approval of a resolution of its thirty-first session.
This National Commission will create within the United States a better understanding of the needs of children, both here and abroad, and will prepare a report and recommendations on national policies to meet these needs.
The powers granted to the National Commission under this Act will be in addition to those provided in Executive Order 12053.

I urge its early passage.

Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
