I was shocked and saddened to learn of the shooting of Vernon Jordan, president of the National Urban League. Vernon is a valued leader and a personal friend. All of us are praying for his speedy and full recovery.
Note: Mr. Jordan was shot early on the morning of May 29 after stepping from a car outside the motel where he was staying in Fort Wayne, Ind.
