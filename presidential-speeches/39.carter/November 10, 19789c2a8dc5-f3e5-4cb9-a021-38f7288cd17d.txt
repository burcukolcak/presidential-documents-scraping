Psychotropic Substances Act of 1978 Statement on Signing S. 2399 Into Law. 
Today I am pleased to sign S. 2399, which enables the United States Government to meet the obligations contained in the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
The United States played a key role in the drafting of the convention in 1971. The treaty sets up a system for controlling drugs such as amphetamines and barbiturates similar to the existing system for narcotics. The passage of S. 2399 ensures that we will be able to fulfill all our obligations under the convention and work more effectively with other governments to curb the illegal trafficking of these drugs.
The treaty must now be ratified, and I look forward to working with the Senate to see that this is done early in the 96th Congress.
Note: As enacted, S. 2399 is Public Law 95633, approved November 10.
