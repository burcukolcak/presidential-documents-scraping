Death of Three Newsmen in Guyana Statement by the White House Press Secretary. 
The President has asked me to convey the shock and grief both he and the First Lady share over the deaths of the three American newsmen in Guyana.
He wishes to express his deepest condolences to the families of Don Harris and Robert Brown, of the National Broadcasting Corporation, and Gregory Robinson, of the San Francisco Examiner. These three men were all hard-driving, talented professionals who lost their lives while pursuing the highest traditions of journalism.
On behalf of the President, Vice President Mondale is personally calling their families to express his sympathies and condolences.
Note: The three newsmen were killed on November 18 by members of the People's Temple, while accompanying Congressman Leo J. Ryan on his investigation of the People's Temple commune in Jonestown, Guyana.
Press Secretary Jody Powell read the statement at 2 p.m. to reporters assembled in the Briefing Room at the White House.
