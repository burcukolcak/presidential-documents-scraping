The Honorable John William McCormack Statement on the Death of the Former Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
I am saddened to learn of the death of Speaker John McCormack. He was a dedicated and distinguished Speaker of the House of Representatives, and throughout his 42 years in the House served with distinction and a strong, heartfelt belief in the Democratic Party.
John McCormack was a man of strong character and remained actively devoted to his constituents through the last months of his life.
Rosalynn and I extend our deepest sympathies to his family and many friends.
