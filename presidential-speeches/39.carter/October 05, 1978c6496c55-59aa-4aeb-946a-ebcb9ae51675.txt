Letter to Members of Congress Urging Support of the Veto of H.R. 12928
To Members of Congress:
The Producers Price Index for finished goods rose 0.9% in September (an annual rate of 11.4%).
I urge you to help me control inflation and to set an example of leadership for the nation by supporting my veto of the public works bill.
