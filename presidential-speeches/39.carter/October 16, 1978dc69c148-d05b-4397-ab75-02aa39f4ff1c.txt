Pope John Paul II Statement on the Election of the Pope. 
I add my congratulations and my sense of joy to that felt around the world at the selection of Pope John Paul II.
Twice in 8 weeks, the College of Cardinals has had to choose a new leader for their Church and for the world—and twice they have given us choices which have filled the Church and the world with new hope.
Like his predecessor, Pope John Paul II has shared the experiences of working people and understands the daily victories and defeats of human life.
A theologian and a worker, he also understands, in a way few in this Nation ever can, the most extreme tests that life presents. He knows what it is to struggle for faith, for freedom, for life itself; and his insight into these modern dilemmas will enrich, and be enriched by, the enduring traditions of his own Church.
During our visit to Poland early this year, Rosalynn and I gained a sense of the spiritual resilience of the nation that has given the world this new Pope. Of all Americans who share my sense of warmth and gratitude for this new leader, Polish Americans have reason for special pride.
Note: An announcement of the U.S. Presidential Delegation to the Investiture of Pope John Paul II, held at the Vatican on October 22, is printed on page 1808 of this volume.
