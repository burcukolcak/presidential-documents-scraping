Republic of Korea Letter to Acting President Choi Kyu Ha Following the Death of President Park Chung Hee. 
Dear Mr. Acting President:
It is with a deep sense of shock and sorrow that I have learned of the death of President Park Chung-Hee. President Park was a firm friend of America, a staunch ally, and an able leader. In particular, his role in Korea's remarkable economic development will not be forgotten.
Let me assure you, as you assume your duties as Acting President, that the United States Government will continue to stand firmly behind its treaty commitments to the Republic of Korea. Our thoughts will be with you and the Korean people during this difficult time.

Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
Note: President Park was assassinated on October 26 by Kim Chae Kyu, Director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, at KGIA headquarters. Also killed during the shooting incident were five of President Park's aides.
On October 30 the White House announced that the President designated Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance to lead the United States delegation to the funeral of President Park in Seoul on Saturday, November 3. Secretary Vance was to be accompanied by the President's son Chip and a delegation of leaders from the Congress, the executive branch, the military services, and the American public.
