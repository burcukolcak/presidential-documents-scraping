National Energy Plan Statement on a Resolution Adopted by the National Conference of Black Mayors.
The President was informed that the National Conference of Black Mayors, meeting in Washington, D.C., adopted a resolution supporting the proposed National Energy Plan. He issued the following statement from Camp David:
"This is an important statement of support from an organization of leaders representing a sizable constituency in America. I appreciate this action by the National Conference of Black Mayors.
"The mayors have .shown that they recognize that a failure to face up to our energy problem will most adversely affect poor people and black people. It shows recognition that passage of the energy program is not a contest between the branches of Government--that, instead, it is a test of our national will. It is my hope that this action by the mayors will add momentum to passage of the National Energy Plan."
