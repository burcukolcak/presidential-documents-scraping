Statement on the Nomination of Shirley Hufstedler To Be Secretary of the Department of Education
Judge Shirley Hufstedler has one of the best minds in the country. To fill the position of first Secretary of the new Department of Education, I wanted a strong, creative thinker who could take a new, fresh look at the way we educate our children. In Judge Shirley Hufstedler, we have found that person.
She is deeply committed to the quality of education and enjoys my full confidence and support. I am certain she will be an outstanding Secretary.
Note: Deputy Press Secretary Rex Granum read the President's statement at approximately 11:45 a.m. to reporters assembled in the Briefing Room at the White House, after announcing that the President will nominate Judge Hufstedler to be Secretary of Education.
Also included in the press release is a question-and-answer session with reporters.
