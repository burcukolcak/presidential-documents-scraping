Executive Order 12016â€”Exemption From Mandatory Retirement
EXEMPTION OF G. JOSEPH MINETTI FROM MANDATORY RETIREMENT
G. Joseph Minetti, Member, Civil Aeronautics Board, became subject to mandatory retirement for age on July 31, 1977, under the provisions of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code unless exempted by Executive Order. Mr. Minetti was exempted from mandatory retirement until September 30, 1977, by Executive Order No. 12006 of July 29, 1977, and until October 31, 1977, by Executive Order No. 12011 of September 30, 1977.
In my judgment, the public interest requires that G. Joseph Minetti continue to be exempted from such mandatory retirement.
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby exempt G. Joseph Minetti from mandatory retirement until January 31, 1978.
