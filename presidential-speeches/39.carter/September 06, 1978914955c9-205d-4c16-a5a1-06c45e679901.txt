Camp David Meeting on the Middle East Joint Statement Issued by President Carter, President Anwar al-Sadat of Egypt, and Prime Minister Menahem Begin of Israel. 
After four wars, despite vast human efforts, the Holy Land does not yet enjoy the blessings of peace.
Conscious of the grave issues which face us, we place our trust in the God of our fathers, from whom we seek wisdom and guidance.
As we meet here at Camp David we ask people of all faiths to pray with us that peace and justice may result from these deliberations.
