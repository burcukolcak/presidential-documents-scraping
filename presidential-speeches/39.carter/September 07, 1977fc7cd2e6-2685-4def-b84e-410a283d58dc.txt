Meeting With President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela Remarks to Reporters Following the Meeting
President Perez has developed into one of my best personal friends and is a great counselor and adviser for me on matters that concern the nations of the Caribbean and Central and South America.
Also, he was of great assistance in the negotiations between ourselves and Panama in developing the terms of the treaty.
The people of our country look upon President Perez as a great leader in this hemisphere and also, of course, the leader of one of the great democracies of the world.
Note: The President spoke at 5:10 p.m. on the South Grounds of the White House. His concluding remarks in Spanish were not included in the transcript.
The transcript of the remarks was made available by the White House Press Office. It was not issued in the form of a White House press release.
