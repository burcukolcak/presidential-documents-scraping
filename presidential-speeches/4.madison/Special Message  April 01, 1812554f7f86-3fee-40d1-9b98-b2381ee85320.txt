Special Message 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
Considering it as expedient, under existing circumstances and prospects, that a general embargo be laid on all vessels now in port, or hereafter arriving, for the period of sixty days, I recommend the immediate passage of a law to that effect.
JAMES MADISON.
