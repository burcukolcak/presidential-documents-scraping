James Madison
December 12, 1810

Special Message 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I lay before Congress, and recommend to their early attention, a report of the Secretary of State, from which it will be seen that a very considerable demand beyond the legal appropriations has been incurred. for the support of seamen distressed by seizures, in different parts of Europe, of the vessels to which they belonged.
JAMES MADISON.
