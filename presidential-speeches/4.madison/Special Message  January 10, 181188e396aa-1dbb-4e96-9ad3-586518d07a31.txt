James Madison
January 10, 1811

Special Message 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I communicate to Congress, in confidence, the translation of a letter from Louis de Onis to the captain-general of Caraccas.
The tendency of misrepresentations and suggestions which it may be inferred from this specimen enter into more important correspondences of the writer to promote in foreign councils at a critical period views adverse to the peace and to the best interests of our country renders the contents of the letter of sufficient moment to be made known to the Legislature.
JAMES MADISON.
