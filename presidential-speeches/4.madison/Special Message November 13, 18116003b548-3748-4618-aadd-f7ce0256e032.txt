November 13, 1811

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I communicate to Congress copies of a correspondence between the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of Great Britain and the Secretary of State relative to the aggression committed by a British ship of war on the United States frigateChesapeake,by which it will be seen that that subject of difference between the two countries is terminated by an offer of reparation, which has been acceded to.
JAMES MADISON.
