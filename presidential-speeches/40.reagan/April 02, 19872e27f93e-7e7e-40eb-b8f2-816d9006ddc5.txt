Statement on the Veto Override of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 
I am deeply disappointed by today's vote. I knew in advance that the battle would be tough and the odds were long. But we cannot retreat from our commitment to a responsible budget. My efforts to control spending are not diminished, and I remain firm in my pledge to the American taxpayers to speak out against such budgetary excesses.
Note: H.R. 2, passed over the President's veto on April 2, became Public Law No. 100-17.
