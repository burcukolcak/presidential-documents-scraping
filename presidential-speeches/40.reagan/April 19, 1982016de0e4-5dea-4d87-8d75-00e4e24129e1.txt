Message to the Congress Transmitting the Annual Report on Federal Advisory Committees 
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the provisions of Section 6(c) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, I am pleased to transmit the tenth Annual Report on Federal Advisory Committees. This Report, prepared by the General Services Administration, summarizes the activities, status, and changes in the composition of Federal Advisory Committees for calendar year 1981.
On January 22, 1981, I directed Executive departments and agencies to reduce obligations for advisory committees by five percent for 1981. I am pleased to report that this effort achieved a reduction of ten percent during the past year. Believing that there are further opportunities for more cost-effective management of advisory committees, I plan shortly to direct actions throughout the Executive Branch which will result in additional savings of approximately ten percent for 1982.
