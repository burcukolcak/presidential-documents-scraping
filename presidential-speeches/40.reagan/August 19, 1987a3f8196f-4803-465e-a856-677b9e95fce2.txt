Statement on Signing the Bill Amending the Bankruptcy Code 
I am signing S. 1577, a bill "To extend certain protections under title 11 of the United States Code, the Bankruptcy Code." In so doing, I reaffirm the statement I issued on May 15, 1987, when I signed S. 903, the prior extension of this temporary legislation. I understand that the permanent legislation that the Congress is presently considering does not contain the unconstitutional nonuniform provision found in the temporary bills.
Note: S. 1577, approved August 18, was assigned Public Law No. 100-99.
