Remarks on Signing a Bill To Commemorate the Illinois and Michigan Canal 
Thank you all for coming. I'm delighted to be here with Governor Thompson and cosponsors Senator Chuck Percy and Congressman Tom Corcoran and Representatives Henry Hyde and Lynn Martin to sign Senate bill 746.
We're pleased that this legislation enjoyed strong bipartisan support, including cosponsorship by Senator Dixon and the longtime support of Congressman Mel Price.
The legislation commemorates the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which was a main artery of commerce in the 19th century, by designating a National Heritage Corridor from Chicago to LaSalle-Peru, Illinois. The legislation also establishes a National Heritage Corridor Commission to assist local and State entities in any appropriate preservation treatment or renovation of the old structures of the canal. We believe such activity will stimulate tourism, jobs, and economic growth, as well as greater cooperation between local, State, and Federal Governments.
So, with that said, I am pleased to sign the bill.
Note: The President spoke at 2:45 p.m. in the Grand Ballroom at the Conrad Hilton Hotel in Chicago, IL. Following the ceremony, the President went to Camp David, MD, for the weekend.
As enacted, S. 746 is Public Law 98-398, approved August 24.
