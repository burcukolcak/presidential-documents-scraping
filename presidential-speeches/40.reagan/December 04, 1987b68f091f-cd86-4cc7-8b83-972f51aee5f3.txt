Statement on the Cuban Inmate Riots in Georgia and Louisiana 
I want to commend Attorney General Meese for his handling of the prison disturbances in Georgia and Louisiana. I am extremely gratified that all of the hostages are now safe.
I would like to thank all of the law enforcement agencies involved, including the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Community Relations Service, and the State and local law enforcement agencies in Georgia and Louisiana. The patience and professionalism demonstrated by all of the agencies involved have been rewarded.

I would also like to thank Bishop Roman and the other members of the Cuban-American community for their assistance in addressing a very difficult problem.
Note: Cuban prisoners in Oakdale, LA, rioted on November 21 in response to a decision to deport 2,000 "undesirables" who had emigrated to the United States from Mariel, Cuba. Thirty hostages were seized in Louisiana, and the riots spread to the Federal prison in Atlanta, GA, where about 100 hostages were seized on November 23. The Attorney General agreed to the individual review of each case, which resolved the crisis.
