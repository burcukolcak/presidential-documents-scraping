Statement on the Designation of Paul H. Nitze as Adviser to the Secretary of State at the Arms Control Talks in Geneva, Switzerland 
At the recommendation of the Secretary of State, I have today asked Ambassador Paul Nitze to serve as adviser to the Secretary for the Geneva talks. Ambassador Nitze has a long history of distinguished service to his country, and I am very pleased that he has accepted.
Note: On the same day, the White House announced that the President and Secretary of State George P. Shultz discussed arms control and other issues during a luncheon meeting at the White House.
Following the luncheon, they met in the Oval Office with Ambassador Nitze for a discussion of the forthcoming Geneva talks. During the afternoon, the President held additional meetings with his advisers to discuss arms control issues.
