Statement on Western Economic Sanctions Against Poland 
We have great respect and admiration for Lech Walesa, the courageous leader of Poland's free trade union movement. We shall give immediate and serious consideration to the issues he has raised and will consult closely with our allies on this matter.
Note: The statement was issued in response to Mr. Walesa's urging that the United States and other Western nations end the sanctions against the Polish Government.
