Statement on Central America Following a Meeting With Ambassador Richard B. Stone 
Last April 27, before the Joint Session of the Congress, I signaled our deep concern with the need for advancing peaceful and democratic solutions in troubled Central America. In that speech I indicated my intention to name a special envoy for Central American negotiations. Ambassador Richard B. Stone, our special envoy, has performed extraordinary service in communicating with the countries of Central America and the Contadora group to help bring democratization and an end of fighting to all the countries of the region.
Ambassador Stone has just informed me of the current status of the various efforts at achieving a peaceful settlement in Central America. I want to reiterate my support and commitment to his delicate but crucial mission. As my personal representative, he speaks for me in our efforts to advance peace and democracy in this nearby area. He plans to return to the area shortly after the first of the year, and I join with all in wishing him the greatest success in his mission.
Note: The President's meeting with Ambassador Stone was held in the morning in the Oval Office at the White House. Other participants in the meeting included the Vice President, Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Robert C. McFarlane, and Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Langhorne A. Motley.
