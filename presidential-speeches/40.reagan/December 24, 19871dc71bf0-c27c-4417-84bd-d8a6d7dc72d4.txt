Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate on the Status of Chile With Respect to the Generalized System of Preferences 
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing concerning the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and Chile. The GSP program is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("the Act").
I intend to suspend indefinitely Chile's status as a GSP beneficiary for failure to comply with section 502(b)(7) (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)(7)) of the Act concerning internationally recognized worker rights. My decision will take effect at least 60 days from the date of this letter.

Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
Note: Identical letters were sent to Jim Wright, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and George Bush, President of the Senate.
