Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate Transmitting the Annual Report on Radiation Control for Health and Safety 
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with Section 360D of the Public Health Service Act, I am submitting the report of the Department of Health and Human Services regarding the administration of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act during calendar year 1987. The cost to prepare this report was $11,861.
The report recommends that Section 360D of the Public Health Service Act that requires the completion of this annual report be repealed. All the information found in this report is available to the Congress on a more immediate basis through congressional committee oversight and budget hearings. This annual report serves little useful purpose and diverts taxpayers' money from productive uses.

Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
Note: Identical letters were sent to Jim Wright, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and George Bush, President of the Senate.
