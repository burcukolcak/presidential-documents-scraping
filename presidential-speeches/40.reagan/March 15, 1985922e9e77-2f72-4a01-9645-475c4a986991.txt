Statement on the Resignation of Raymond J. Donovan as Secretary of Labor 
It is with deep regret that I accept the resignation of Raymond Donovan as Secretary of Labor. Ray Donovan has not been convicted of anything; and, no less than any other American, he is entitled to the benefit of a presumption of innocence. While I agree with Ray that his need to devote himself fully to his defense now precludes his continuing in office, he leaves the Cabinet with my friendship and heartfelt gratitude for all of his efforts on behalf of this administration.
Note: Larry M. Speakes, Principal Deputy Press Secretary to the President, read the President's statement to reporters at 4:15 p.m. in the Briefing Room at the White House.
