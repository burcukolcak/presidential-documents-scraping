Statement on the Nomination of Edwin Meese III To Be Attorney General of the United States 
I support Ed Meese's request to the Attorney General for the appointment of an independent counsel. I know that an impartial, prompt, and thorough inquiry will demonstrate the high level of integrity and dedication which have marked Ed's long career of public service. I will not withdraw his nomination for the position of Attorney General.
He has been my trusted colleague for 17 years. He will remain as my Counsellor to the President until confirmed. I am confident that the results of an independent inquiry will permit the Senate to confirm rapidly his nomination.
Note: On the same day, Mr. Meese sent a letter to Attorney General William French Smith requesting that the Attorney General recommend the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the allegations raised before the Senate Judiciary Committee which relate to Mr. Meese.
