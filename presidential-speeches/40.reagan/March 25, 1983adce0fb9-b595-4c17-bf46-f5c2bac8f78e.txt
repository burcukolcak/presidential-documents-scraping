Proclamation 5037—Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week, 1983

The strength of America lies in our free enterprise system, and the spirit of our great Nation grows out of the richness of our diverse cultural heritage and the hard work and convictions of our citizens.
Americans who have come to this land from Asian and Pacific countries have overcome great adversity and supreme challenges to make outstanding contributions to our Nation's progress in a wide range of fields—science, the arts, medicine, law, literature, agriculture, industry, commerce, and government.
As we celebrate the accomplishments of Asian and Pacific Americans, we are grateful to them for bringing to our shores the strong and varied traditions of their homelands and for greatly enriching our culture and our institutions. We appreciate and value their presence and treasure their enduring commitment to the unalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,President of the United States of America, do hereby declare the week beginning May 7, 1983 as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week and call upon the American people to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this 25th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.


RONALD REAGAN
