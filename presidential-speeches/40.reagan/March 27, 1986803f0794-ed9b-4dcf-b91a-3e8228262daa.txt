Q. Are you hyping up those stories about troops in Honduras?
The President. The White House is giving you the truth, as I think all of us know.
Q. How bad was this invasion? We hear there weren't as many people.
The President. All that I can understand is that we knew there were two battalions. Now, you're talking of rough numbers of a battalion. Maybe those battalions were under strength or over strength, which we don't know on that as to the exact numbers. But there were two battalions which could number around 1,500.
Q. What do you think about going after American targets in Libya? They're talking about going after American targets?
The President. Everyone understands now the exercise is over.
