Statement on Signing the Bill Proclaiming the Year of New Sweden 
I am very pleased today to sign S.J. Res. 289, a joint resolution that recognizes the important role the settlers of New Sweden played in forming our nation. Those settlers were Swedish and Finnish people who by their bravery and tenacity gave us a treasured legacy: They helped form our country, and they helped establish the pioneer spirit and hardy virtues that are the foundation for our national character. The anniversary of their landing is an occasion to celebrate our origins and to remember that our friendship with Sweden and Finland has an intimate and historic beginning.
Note: S.J. Res. 289, approved May 15, was assigned Public Law No. 99-304.
