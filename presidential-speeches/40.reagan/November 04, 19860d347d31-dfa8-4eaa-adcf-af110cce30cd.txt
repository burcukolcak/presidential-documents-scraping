Statement on Signing the Bill Amending the Quiet Title Act 
I welcome the opportunity to sign H.R. 2484, providing amendments to the Quiet Title Act. The product of long negotiation and of compromise, the bill removes impediments to the rights of States to sue the Federal Government in disputes over ownership of public lands. This measure represents a significant victory for principles of federalism. With the provisions of these amendments in place, we all can enjoy more certainty and repose with regard to Federal and State land claims.
Note: H.R. 2484, approved November 4, was assigned Public Law No. 99-598.
