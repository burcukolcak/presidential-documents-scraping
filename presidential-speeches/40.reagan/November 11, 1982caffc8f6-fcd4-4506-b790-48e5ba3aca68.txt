Memorandum on the Chicago World's Fair 1992: Age of Discovery 
Memorandum for the Secretary of Commerce
Subject: Chicago World's Fair 1992: Age of Discovery
I have reviewed the reports and recommendations presented to me by you and the Secretary of State that recognition be given to the "Chicago World's Fair 1992: Age of Discovery", and find that such recognition will be in the national interest.
I approve granting Federal recognition to the Exposition with the understanding that the Federal participation in the Fair will not exceed $90 million over the next ten year period.
On that basis, please advise the appropriate agencies that official recognition is hereby granted.
I would also appreciate your taking the appropriate steps to notify the Congress of this action, in accordance with Section 2(c) of P.L. 91-269.
RONALD REAGAN
