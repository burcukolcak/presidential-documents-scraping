Statement on Senate Confirmation of the Nomination of William P. Clark as Secretary of the Interior 
I am deeply grateful to the Members of the United States Senate for their prompt action on the nomination of William P. Clark to be Secretary of the Interior.
Bill Clark brings to that post all of the qualities necessary to be an outstanding public servant—integrity, dedication, common sense, and a willingness to work hard on behalf of his fellow countrymen. I know he will be a great asset to our government.
He shares with me an abiding respect for our natural resources and for the splendid beauty which is uniquely American. Throughout his stewardship at Interior, Bill will be looking for ways to meet the legitimate interests of all segments of our society.
I welcome Bill Clark—a talented and conscientious man—to the Cabinet.
Note: Mr. Clark was sworn in as Secretary of the Interior at a ceremony in the Oval Office at the White House on November 21.
