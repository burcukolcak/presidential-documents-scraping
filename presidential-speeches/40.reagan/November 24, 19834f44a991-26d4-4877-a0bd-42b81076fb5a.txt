Statement on the Soviet Response to the United States Reaction to the Discontinuance of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force Negotiations 
We can only be dismayed at this Soviet statement. It is at sharp variance with the stated wish of the Soviet Union that an agreement be negotiated.
While we are dismayed, we are determined to renew our efforts to entirely do away with the land-based, intermediaterange nuclear missile systems. We continue to seek negotiations in good faith.
Note: The President's statement was made in response to a statement by Soviet President Yuriy V. Andropov.
