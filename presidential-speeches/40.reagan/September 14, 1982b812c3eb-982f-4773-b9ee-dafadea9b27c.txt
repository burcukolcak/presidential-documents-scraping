Statement on the Death of Princess Grace of Monaco 
Nancy and I were shocked and deeply saddened to learn of the tragic and untimely death of Her Serene. Highness, Princess Grace of Monaco. Princess Grace was deeply loved by the people of Monaco because she was a compassionate and gentle lady who had a deep and abiding affection for her adopted country and people. As an American, Princess Grace brought character and elegance to the performing arts and always found time to make important contributions to her craft.
The Principality of Monaco and the world community have suffered a great loss. To the people of Monaco and to the Royal Family, we extend our deepest sympathy.
Note: Princess Grace, the former Grace Kelly, died on September 14 from injuries sustained in a car accident in Monaco the previous day.
On September 16, the White House released the following announcement concerning the U.S. Delegation to the funeral services:
President Reagan today designated Nancy Reagan to lead the United States Delegation to the funeral services for Her Serene Highness, Princess Grace of Monaco, a cherished friend of the First Lady's for many years.
