Message to Prime Minister Robert Hawke of Australia on the Victory of the Australia H in the America's Cup Competition 
Dear Bob:
If the America's Cup had to leave the United States, I am delighted that it's home will be Australiaâ€”at least until the next race. All Australians must be justifiably proud of the extraordinary team effort, skill and sportsmanship that brought off this magnificent victory. I hope you will share with all those who had anything to do with Australia IIs success my congratulations and those of the American people.
One major consolation for us is that the next race will provide a large number of Americans the opportunity to enjoy the beauty and hospitality of Perth as they seek to bring home the Cup.

Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
