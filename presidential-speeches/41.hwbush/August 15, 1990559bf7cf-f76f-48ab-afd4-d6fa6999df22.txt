Letter to Congressional Leaders on Trade With the German Democratic Republic
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to subsection 402(c)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 2432(c)(2)), I have determined that a waiver of the application of subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 with respect to the German Democratic Republic will substantially promote the objectives of section 402. A copy of that determination is enclosed. I have also received the assurances with respect to the emigration practices of the German Democratic Republic required by section 402(c)(2)(B) of the Act.
Pursuant to section 402(c)(2), I shall issue an Executive order waiving the application of subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Act with respect to the German Democratic Republic.
Sincerely,
George Bush
