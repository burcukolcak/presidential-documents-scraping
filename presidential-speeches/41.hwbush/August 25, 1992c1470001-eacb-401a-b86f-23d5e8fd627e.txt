Letter to Congressional Leaders on Trade With Republics of the Former Yugoslavia
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add each of the former republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, other than Serbia and Montenegro, to the list of beneficiaries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. market and is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974.
I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, and particularly the Balkan nations' ongoing political and economic reforms, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to the former republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, other than Serbia and Montenegro.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974.
Sincerely,
George Bush
