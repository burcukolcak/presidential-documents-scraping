Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the Report of the Presidential Economic Delegation to Poland
Dear XXXXX:
I am transmitting herewith the final report of the Presidential Economic Delegation that I sent to Poland at the end of November. I think that you will find the conclusions of Secretaries Yeutter, Mosbacher, and Dole and CEA Chairman Boskin, and of the 20 distinguished private sector participants in the Mission, well worth reading.
This report will help to ensure that the assistance provided by the "Support for Eastern European Democracy Act of 1989" will be used to maximum effect.
Sincerely,
George Bush
Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the House of Representatives; Richard A. Gephardt and Robert H. Michel, majority and minority leaders of the House of Representatives, respectively; and George J. Mitchell and Robert Dole, majority and minority leaders of the Senate, respectively.
