Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President Ronald Venetiaan of Suriname
Japan-U.S. Relations
Q. Any defense of American workers in response to what Mr. Miyazawa said?
The President. Just go by what Marlin Fitzwater told you guys when you asked the same question about 6 hours ago. [Laughter]
Q. Have you seen the -- --
The President. Strong support. I just heard what Marlin said, and I back it 100 percent. I also saw the correction by Mr. Miyazawa, I'm pleased to say. So, that was fine.
Q. Do you accept that, sir, as an apology?
The President. I accept it for what it was, a very clear statement from a good man, a man who has said clearly that they're going to live up to their commitments, and I support him for that. And we had a very good visit. So, you know, he's gone out of his way to make clear that he was not denouncing all American workers. And I strongly support them and continue to say so. We can compete with anybody in the world if we're given access. Marlin summed up our position very well.
Note: The exchange began at 4:31 p.m. in the Oval Office. In his remarks, the President referred to Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan.
