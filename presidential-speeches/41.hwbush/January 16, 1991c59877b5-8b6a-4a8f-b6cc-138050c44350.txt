Statement on Allied Military Action in the Persian Gulf
I have a statement by the President of the United States:
The liberation of Kuwait has begun. In conjunction with the forces of our coalition partners, the United States has moved under the code name Operation Desert Storm to enforce the mandates of the United Nations Security Council. As of 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Operation Desert Storm forces were engaging targets in Kuwait and Iraq.
President Bush will address the Nation at 9 p.m. tonight from the Oval Office. I'll try to get you more as soon as we can. Thank you very much.
Note: Press Secretary Fitzwater read the statement to reporters at 7:08 p.m. in the Briefing Room at the White House.
