Memorandum on Regulatory Coordination
Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
Subject: Regulatory Coordination
As you know, the Congress has failed to enact important growth-oriented legislation that we have proposed. Although we will continue to work with the Congress to enact these proposals, we must also redouble our efforts to create jobs and achieve economic growth within existing statutory constraints.
For such efforts to succeed, we must prevent the fragmentation of policy-making and better coordinate existing programs within the executive branch. We have made great strides in this area, but more remains to be done. Your agencies share responsibility for promoting safe and efficient energy production while at the same time protecting the environment. It is therefore essential that you work together to streamline the regulatory process and ensure that the regulated community is not subject to duplicative or inconsistent regulation.
I hope that improved coordination will be one especially valuable outcome of the 90-day moratorium and review period described in the attached memorandum. I look forward to your reports on this important undertaking. Although the Congress has created the regulatory schemes within which we must operate, I am confident that, with your help, the executive branch can do much to create conditions conducive to a healthy and robust economy.
