Remarks Prior to Discussions With Foreign Minister Ahmed Esmat Abdel Meguid of Egypt
May I just say welcome to the Egyptian journalists, and we're glad you're here.
I might violate a rule here. I normally don't have much to say in the Oval Office, but I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the Egyptian Government, specifically to President Mubarak and to Foreign Minister Meguid, for standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the coalition, leading it in many ways, and for the steadfast position that Egypt has taken in trying to counteract this aggression by Saddam Hussein. It's been a miraculous -- a strong, wonderful leadership coming out of Egypt, and we are very grateful. And I'm very happy that I can say that here from the bottom of my heart.
Thank you all very much.
Note: President Bush spoke at 1:40 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
