Soviet-United States Joint Statement on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor
At their meeting in Geneva in 1985, the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union emphasized the importance of the work aimed at utilizing controlled thermonuclear fusion for peaceful purposes, and advocated the widest practical development of international cooperation in obtaining this essentially inexhaustible source of energy for the benefit of all mankind.
The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, involving joint efforts by the USSR, the United States, Japan and the European Community, under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is making significant progress towards this end. A conceptual design will soon be completed.
Noting with satisfaction the results being attained under this project, the United States and the Soviet Union look forward to continued international efforts aimed at promoting further progress in developing controlled thermonuclear fusion for peaceful purposes.
Note: The joint statement was made available by the Office of the Press Secretary but was not issued as a White House press release.
