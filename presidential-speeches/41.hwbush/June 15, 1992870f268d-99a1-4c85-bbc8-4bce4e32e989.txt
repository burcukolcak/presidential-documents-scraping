Memorandum on the Generalized System of Preferences
Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Subject: Actions Concerning the Generalized System of Preferences
Pursuant to section 504 of the 1974 Act, after considering various requests for a waiver of the application of section 504(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)) with respect to certain eligible articles, I have determined that it is appropriate to modify the application of duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) currently being afforded to certain articles and to certain beneficiary developing countries.
Specifically, pursuant to section 504(c)(3) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)(3)), I have determined that it is appropriate to waive the application of section 504(c) of the 1974 Act with respect to Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) subheading 2401.10.40 for Turkey. I have received the advice of the United States International Trade Commission on whether any industries in the United States are likely to be adversely affected by such waiver, and I have determined, based on that advice and on the considerations described in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c)), that such waiver is in the national economic interest of the United States.
Further, I have also determined, pursuant to section 504(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(d)(1)), that the limitation provided for in section 504(c)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)(1)(B)) should not apply with respect to certain eligible articles because no like or directly competitive article was produced in the United States on January 3, 1985. Such articles are enumerated in the list below of HTS subheadings.
These determinations shall be published in the Federal Register.
