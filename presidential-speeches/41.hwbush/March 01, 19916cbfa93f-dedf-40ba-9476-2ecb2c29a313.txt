Remarks Prior to Discussions With Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of Germany
As I mentioned earlier to the first wave, we are very grateful to Germany for its support for the operations in recently concluded Desert Storm. We've got to work together now, and we will, to help enhance the peace. And so, I think we're all in a better position to do that. And I just want you to know, and please convey to Chancellor Kohl that we're -- as I'm sure Jim has told you -- determined to play our part in all of this. So, it's a big problem, but anyway, one we've got to tackle.
Thank you all. It's been a great pleasure.
Note: The President spoke at 10:35 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
