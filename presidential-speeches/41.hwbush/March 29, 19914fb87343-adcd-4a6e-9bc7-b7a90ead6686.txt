Statement on the Death of Lee Atwater
Barbara and I lost a great friend in Lee Atwater. I valued Lee's counsel and abilities. The Republican Party will miss his energy, vision, and leadership. Barbara and I give our deepest condolences to Sally, the kids, and Lee's parents. We share in their grief. Lee will always be in our memories.
Note: H. Lee Atwater was former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
