Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate on Trade With Hungary
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Hungary to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).
The Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 first allowed Hungary to be considered for GSP benefits. We have carefully examined Hungary under the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502(b) and (c) (19 U.S.C. 2461; 2462(b) and (c)) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. In light of these criteria, and particularly Hungary's ongoing political and economic reform, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Hungary.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.
Sincerely,
George Bush
Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Dan Quayle, President of the Senate.
