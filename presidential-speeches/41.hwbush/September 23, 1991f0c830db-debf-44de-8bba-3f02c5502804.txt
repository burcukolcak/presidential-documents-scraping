Exchange With Reporters on an Unemployment Benefits Bill
Q. Mr. President, do you have any indication Saddam Hussein is doing the right thing in Iraq today?
The President. I've been working on unemployment benefits this morning. Been on the telephone. And we strongly support Bob Dole's package, which is budgetarily sound, forward-looking, takes care of those that really need help. So, I've been focusing on that this morning and calling several Senators about it, and I just hope that the Senate will do what's needed, and that is help these people, but also do something that is budgetarily sound, and that is -- where we have offsets and we stay within the budget agreement. So, that's what I've been concentrating on.

Q. Mr. President, do you think -- --
The President. Well, I'm going to be focusing on all that when we get up there, and I'll have something to say about it later this morning.
Note: The President spoke at 10:05 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White House. During this exchange, a reporter referred to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Robert Dole is Senate Minority Leader. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
