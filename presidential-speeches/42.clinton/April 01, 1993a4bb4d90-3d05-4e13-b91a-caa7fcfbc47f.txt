Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders
Q. Mr. President, is your stimulus package in trouble? That's what we hear.
The President. Well, we just passed the budget, but I'm celebrating that right now. I think we can pass it. We'll keep working on it. We have to have 60 votes to pass it, but we'll keep working on it.
We're here talking about Russia today.
NOTE: The exchange began at 10:30 a.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
