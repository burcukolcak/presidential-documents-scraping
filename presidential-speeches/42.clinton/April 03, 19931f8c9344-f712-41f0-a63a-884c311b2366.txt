Exchange With Reporters With President Boris Yeltsin of Russia in Vancouver
Russia- U.S. Relations

The United States has a great deal to gain from a strong, successful, democratic Russia. It is in our interest. And I'm very encouraged by the things that President Yeltsin has stood for, and the fight that he's waging now.
President Yeltsin. And the rest of the world, too.
