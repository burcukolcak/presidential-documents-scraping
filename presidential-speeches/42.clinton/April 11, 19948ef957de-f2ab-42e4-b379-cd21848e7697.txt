Statement on Trade Sanctions Against Taiwan
This is the first time any country has acted on the international call for trade sanctions to protect endangered species, but if the illegal trade in rhinos and tigers is not eliminated, these species could be extinct in 5 years. This administration recognizes that threats to endangered species are of critical importance. The world must know that the United States will take strong actions to protect the Earth's natural heritage.
NOTE: This statement was included in a statement by the Press Secretary on the institution of trade sanctions against Taiwan.
