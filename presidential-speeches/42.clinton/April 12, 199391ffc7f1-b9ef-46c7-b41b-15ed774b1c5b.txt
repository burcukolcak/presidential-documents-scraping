Remarks at the White House Easter Egg Roll
Good morning, everybody. I want to welcome all of you here to the White House for the Easter egg roll and the Easter egg hunt. I want to say a special word of thanks to the sponsors who made this possible and say how wonderful it is for all of us here to see the children, especially for me and for Hillary.
And I want now to introduce the First Lady, who is the hostess for this event, to say a few more words about it. But let me again say how very, very grateful we are to see all of you here. This is a children's day for America at The White House, and I'm glad you're here to make it so special. Please welcome the First Lady.
NOTE: The President spoke at 10:48 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White House. Following his remarks, Hillary Clinton welcomed the participants to the annual White House Easter egg roll. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
