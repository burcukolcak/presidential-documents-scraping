Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President Kim Yong-sam of South Korea in Cheju
Q.Good morning, sir.
The President.Good morning. Did you get some sleep?
Q.A little bit. Mr. President, do you think the start of these four-way talks could really bring peace to this peninsula? Are you encouraged that these four-way talks could lead to peace? What about the situation along the border between Israel and Lebanon; anything the United States can do to stop that fighting?
The President.We're going to answer questions, you know, after our meeting; but we're working very hard on that and we've been at it for a couple of days now, and we're doing the best we can.
