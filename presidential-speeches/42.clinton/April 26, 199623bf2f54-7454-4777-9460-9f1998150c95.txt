Memorandum for the Secretary of Agriculture
Subject: Suspension of Subsection 325(a) and Subsection 325(b) of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appro- priations Act, 1996, ("Act") as set forth in Section 101(c) of Title I of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (H.R. 3019) Concerning the Tongass National Forest
By the authority vested in me by subsection 325(c) of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996, ("Act") as set forth in section 101(c) of title I of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (H.R. 3019), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby suspend subsections 325(a) and 325(b) of the Act because I have determined that such suspension is appropriate based upon the public interest in sound environmental management and protection of cultural, biological, or historic resources.
This suspension shall take effect immediately and shall continue in effect for the period in which subsection 325(a) and subsection 325(b) of the Act would otherwise be in effect.
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
