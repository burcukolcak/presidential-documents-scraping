Statement on Additional California Earthquake Assistance
Years after natural disasters struck the Bay area and south Florida, ghost towns remain and local communities continue to suffer. We are working today to overcome those problems, when they have become far more difficult and expensive to address. In Los Angeles and Santa Monica, we are proposing to begin the restoration of these ghost towns now, before it is too late.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing that the President requested additional fiscal year 1994 funds for the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the repair and reconstruction of housing damaged by the southern California earthquake earlier this year.
