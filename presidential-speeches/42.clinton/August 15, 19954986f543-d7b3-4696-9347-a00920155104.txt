Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of Export Control Regulations
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
On August 19, 1994, in light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401et seq.) I issued Executive Order No. 12924, declaring a national emergency and continuing the system of export regulation under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701et seq.). Under section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), the national emergency terminates on the anniversary date of its declaration unless the President publishes in theFederal Registerand transmit to the Congress a notice of its continuation.
I am hereby advising the Congress that I have extended the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12924. Attached is a copy of the notice of extension.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
