Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Addition of Nigeria to the Generalized System of Preferences
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Nigeria to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program, which offers duty-free access to the U.S. market, was originally authorized by the Trade Act of 1974.
I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Nigeria.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(f)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on August 27. The proclamation of August 27 modifying the Generalized System of Preferences to add Nigeria to the list of beneficiary developing countries is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
