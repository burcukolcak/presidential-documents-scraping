Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting an Amendment of the Generalized System of Preferences
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I hereby transmit a Proclamation in which I have determined that it is appropriate to grant preferential treatment for Nigeria as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). GSP benefits must be granted to Nigeria before that nation can receive further trade benefits under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Public Law 106-200).
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The proclamation of August 27 modifying the Generalized System of Preferences to add Nigeria to the list of beneficiary developing countries is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
