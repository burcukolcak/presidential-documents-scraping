Radio Remarks on Reducing Drunk Driving
Working together, we've made enormous progress in reducing drunk driving in America. Today I'm pleased to report we're making even more. Last year the number of people killed in alcohol-related crashes hit a record low, and young people killed in alcohol-related crashes fell to the lowest rate ever recorded. But even one child killed because of drunk driving is one too many.
Today I'm pleased to announce the Departments of Transportation and Justice will release a total of over $47 million in grants to help communities combat drunk driving and underage drinking and increases seatbelt use. Ultimately, of course, all of us must take responsibility. So if you choose to drink, always designate a driver and always wear your seatbelt. Let's make this the safest Labor Day weekend ever.
NOTE: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 10:40 a.m. at Edgartown Elementary School in Martha's Vineyard, MA, for later broadcast. The transcript was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on September 2. These remarks were also made available on the White House Press Office Radio Actuality Line.
