Radio Remarks Announcing Housing Grants for People With AIDS
For too many Americans living with AIDS, poverty is nearly as much a threat as the disease itself. People with AIDS face enormous medical bills and are often too sick to hold a job. Without our help, many would be forced to live in unfit housing or even to become homeless. We must not turn our backs on these Americans when they need us most. Today I am announcing $221 million in grants that will help meet the housing needs of the 85,000 Americans who have AIDS and those who live with a family member with the disease. These grants, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, will mean that people fighting AIDS don't have to also fight to keep a roof over their heads.
NOTE: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 5:47 p.m. on November 24 in the Oval Office at the White House for later broadcast. The transcript was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on December 1.
