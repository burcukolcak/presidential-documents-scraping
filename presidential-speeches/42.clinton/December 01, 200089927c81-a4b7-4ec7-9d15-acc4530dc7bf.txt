Letter to Congressional Leaders on Modifications to the List of Beneficiary Developing Countries Under the Generalized System of Preferences
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I hereby notify you of my intent to modify the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which offers duty-free access to the U.S. market for eligible products imported from designated beneficiary developing countries. Specifically, I intend to change the designation of "Western Samoa" to "Samoa," to reflect this nation's current name, in the list of beneficiary developing countries and to designate Samoa as a least-developed beneficiary developing country under the GSP. I have carefully considered the criteria in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974 and have determined that it is appropriate to designate Samoa as such.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(f) of the Trade Act of 1974.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The proclamation of December 1 on the Generalized System of Preferences is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
