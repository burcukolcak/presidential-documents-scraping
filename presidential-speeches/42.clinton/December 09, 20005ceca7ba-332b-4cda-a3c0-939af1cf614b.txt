Statement on Russian President Vladimir Putin's Decision To Pardon Edmond Pope
I welcome President Putin's statement of his intent to pardon and release Edmond Pope. It will be a great relief to all Americans Mr. Pope is finally freed and reunited with his family. We want to see him home and safe when as soon as possible.
