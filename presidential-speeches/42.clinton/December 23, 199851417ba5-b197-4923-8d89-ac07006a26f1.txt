Christmas Greeting to the Nation
The President.On this joyous occasion, Hillary and I would like to wish all of you a very Merry Christmas. As we gather around our Christmas trees and dinner tables, let's take the time to give thanks for the blessings of the year just passed, to rejoice in our children, to enjoy the company of family and friends.
As we approach the feast of light, I'd like also to send a special greeting to all the brave men and women in uniform who are serving our country in lands far from home. You're in our hearts and our prayers. On behalf of all Americans, I thank you for the greatest gift of the season, for protecting our Nation and safeguarding the freedom we all hold dear.
The First Lady.Christmas reminds us that the values we share far outweigh whatever the differences there are between us. The twinkle of a child's eye, the joy of a grandmother's laughter, the love in the hearts of mothers and fathers for their children, all these blessings should be unwrapped on Christmas morning.
The President.May the spirit of the season be with you today and throughout the year. From our family to yours, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and God bless you all.
NOTE: The greeting was videotaped at approximately 11:30 a.m. on December 7 in the Diplomatic Reception Room for later broadcast. The transcript was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on December 23.
