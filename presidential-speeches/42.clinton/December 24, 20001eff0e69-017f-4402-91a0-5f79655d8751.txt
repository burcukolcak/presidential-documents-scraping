Christmas Greeting to the Nation
The President.On this holiest of holidays, Hillary and I would like to wish all of you a very Merry Christmas. Tonight we gather with family and friends to reflect on our good fortune, rejoice in the memories of the year past, and look forward with hope to the days ahead.
And we give thanks to America's men and women in uniform, who are spending this holiday protecting freedom around the world.
The First Lady.And we also remember those who are too often left behind, because Christmas isn't just about getting gifts; it's about the miracle of giving them. As we enjoy our last Christmas in the White House, the President, Chelsea, and I are profoundly grateful for the gift you've given our family, the privilege of serving your family these last 8 years.
The President.So from our family to yours, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and God bless you all.
