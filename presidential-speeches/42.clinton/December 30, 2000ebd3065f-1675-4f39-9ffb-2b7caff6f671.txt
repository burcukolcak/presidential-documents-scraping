Memorandum on Potential Electricity Shortages in Western States
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject:Potential Electricity Shortages in Western States
Increased demand for electricity during cold winter weather can make it a challenge for electric utilities to meet the demand of their customers and keep lights on and their homes and businesses warm. Currently, the supply of electric power is tight on the West Coast due to record demand for electricity. The region faces the possibility of electricity shortages in some areas, which would put both consumers and businesses at risk.
The Federal Government is among the largest consumers of electricity in Western States. It is important that the Federal Government lead by example in taking energy conserving steps to reduce the risk and severity of power outages. Therefore, I direct that:
When the Federal Government, State governments, businesses, and consumers work together to use electricity wisely, we can reduce the risk of power shortages in the short term and keep the power on.
