Statement on the Withdrawal of Kimba Wood as a Candidate for Attorney General
I understand and respect Judge Wood's decision not to proceed further with the possibility of being nominated as Attorney General. I was greatly impressed with her as a lawyer, a judge, and a person. I respect her legal talents, judicial record, and integrity. I wish her well.
