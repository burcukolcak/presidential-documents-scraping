Message to the Congress Transmitting the Poland-United States Fisheries Agreement
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Poland extending the Agreement of August 1, 1985, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States, with annexes and agreed minutes, as amended and extended (the 1985 Agreement). The Agreement, which was effected by an exchange of notes at Warsaw on February 5 and August 25, 1997, extends the 1985 Agreement to December 31, 1999.
In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the Republic of Poland, I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, February 5, 1998.
