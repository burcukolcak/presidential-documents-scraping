Statement on Disaster Assistance for Georgia, Florida, and Alabama
We will continue to stand by the people of Georgia, Florida, and Alabama as they do the hard work of recovering from last summer's storms, rebuilding their homes, repairing their roads, and restarting their businesses.
Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing an additional $145 million in emergency funding for the States to assist in their continuing recovery from the effects of Tropical Storm Alberto.
