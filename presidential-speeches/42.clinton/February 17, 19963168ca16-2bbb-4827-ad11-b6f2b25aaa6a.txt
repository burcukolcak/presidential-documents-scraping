Telephone Remarks to the Community of Rochester, New Hampshire
I'm sorry I'm not there, but I'm on the way. We spent 2 hours on the runway in Washington today, waiting for a weather clearance. If you'll wait for me, I'll be there. I'm looking forward to it.
I know between Jeanne Shaheen and everybody else that's there you can find plenty of people to speak until I get there. Just tell old stories and reminisce, and I'll be there as quick as I can.
Thank you. Goodbye.
NOTE: The President spoke at 10:40 a.m. aboard Air Force One en route to Pease International Trade Port. In his remarks, he referred to Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire State senator.
