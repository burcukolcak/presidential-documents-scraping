Videotaped Remarks on the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
Rising oil prices have brought hardship to many families struggling to pay heating bills. I've released $295 million in emergency funds to help low income families cope with home heating cost. But many struggling families aren't aware they qualify for aid. That's why I've asked States to help make sure they reach as many eligible families as possible. To find out if you're eligible for help with heating bills, contact your State government or call 1-800-735-8004.
NOTE: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 6:30 p.m. on February 18 in the Roosevelt Room at the White House for later broadcast as a public service announcement. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
