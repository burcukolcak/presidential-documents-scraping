Radio Remarks on the "Insure Kids Now" Initiative
As every parent knows, nothing is more important than keeping our children healthy. So I have very good news for working parents. Even if you can't afford private health insurance, it's now possible to get help with doctor bills, medicines, and hospital care for your children. If your children are uninsured, please call 1- 877-KIDS-NOWâ€”1-877-KIDS-NOW. With a little help, your children can get the care they need to grow up healthy and strong.
