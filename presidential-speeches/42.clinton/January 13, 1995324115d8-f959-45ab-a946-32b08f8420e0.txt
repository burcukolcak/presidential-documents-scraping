Statement on Investment Funds for Central and Eastern Europe
In Prague last January, I promised we would create investment funds for Central and Eastern Europe. This January we have four of them. They can mean billions of dollars in capital investment to help fuel economic development in the region while creating jobs for Americans at home.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing new Overseas Private Investment Corporation loan guaranty commitments for two privately owned and managed equity funds.
