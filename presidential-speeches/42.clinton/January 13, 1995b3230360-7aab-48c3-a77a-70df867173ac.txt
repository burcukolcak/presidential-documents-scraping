Statement on Bilateral Investment Treaties With Albania and Latvia
These bilateral investment treaties put in place a strong foundation for expanded U.S. trade and investment with the reforming democracies of Central and Eastern Europe. They are another step toward integrating Europe's new democracies with an expanding transatlantic community. Americans and Central Europeans alike will benefit through the increased business.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing the signing of the treaties.
