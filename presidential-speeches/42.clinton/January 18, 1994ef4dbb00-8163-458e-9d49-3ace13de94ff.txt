Letter on Withdrawal of the Nomination of Admiral Bobby R. Inman To Be Secretary of Defense
Dear Admiral Inman:
It is with regret that I accept your request that I not submit your nomination as Secretary of Defense. While I understand the personal considerations that have led you to this decision, I am nevertheless saddened that our Nation will be denied your service.
I wish you the very best as you continue to work on your many important endeavors as a private citizen.
Very truly yours,
BILL CLINTON
NOTE: The White House also made available Admiral Inman's letter requesting that his nomination be withdrawn.
