Statement on James and Sally Barksdale's Pledge to the University of Mississippi
Hillary and I applaud James and Sally Barksdale for their dedication and leadership on behalf of the cause of literacy. Their generous pledge of $100 million to the University of Mississippi will provide schoolchildren in that State—especially those in the most needy schools—with access to new reading programs, train teachers in reading education, and promote efforts to target and help students struggling to learn to read. Their generosity is an example of the extraordinary role philanthropy plays in providing a better future for our children, families, and country.
