Statement on the Attorney General's Decision To Conclude the Investigation of Harold Ickes
I have always had confidence that Harold Ickes acted lawfully and appropriately, and I am pleased by the decision announced by the Attorney General today. Harold's contributions to this administration over the years have helped improve the quality of life in this country, and I will always be thankful for his advice and hard work on behalf of the American people.
NOTE: On January 29, Attorney General Janet Reno notified the Special Division of the Court of Appeals in Washington, DC, that there were no reasonable grounds for further investigation into whether Mr. Ickes knowingly and willfully testified falsely before Congress in September 1997.
