Letter to Members of Congress on Health Care Reform
Dear__________:
As you leave to celebrate the Fourth of July after weeks of hard work, I wanted to point out what a remarkable week this has been on health care. When Congress returns after the recess, you will have the opportunity to vote to provide guaranteed health coverage to every American.
The Committees have been hard at work, and for the first time ever bills guaranteeing universal coverage will be ready to go to the floor. We can make history in the month ahead if we listen to the American people.
Look at the events of this week—
We will have the opportunity to give the American people what they need and want, and to give the American economy what it needs—guaranteed private insurance for every American.
Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON
