Statement on Flooding in Alabama and Georgia and Fires in Colorado
My thoughts and prayers are with the people back home who are battling these fires and floods and especially with the families of those who have lost their lives in the disaster. I have directed all the Federal departments who can help to make their most aggressive efforts to do so.
NOTE: This statement was part of a White House announcement on disaster assistance to Alabama.
