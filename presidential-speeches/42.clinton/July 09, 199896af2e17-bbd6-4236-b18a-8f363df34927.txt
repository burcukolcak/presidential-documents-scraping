Statement on Senate Action on Internal Revenue Service Reform Legislation
I am pleased that the Senate has finally passed bipartisan legislation to reform the IRS and strengthen taxpayer rights. This reform will help my effort to create an IRS that respects American taxpayers and respects their values. I look forward to signing it into law.
