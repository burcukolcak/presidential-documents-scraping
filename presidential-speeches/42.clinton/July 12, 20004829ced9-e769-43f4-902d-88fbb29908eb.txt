Statement on the Accident in the Philippines
I was deeply saddened to learn of the lives lost and families devastated by the terrible incident that took place on the outskirts of Manila. On behalf of the American people, I extend my deepest sympathies to all those who have suffered losses and injuries. Our thoughts and prayers also go out to those who are still waiting to hear word about friends and family members still missing.
NOTE: On July 11, debris from the collapse of the Payatas garbage dump killed more than 100 area residents.
