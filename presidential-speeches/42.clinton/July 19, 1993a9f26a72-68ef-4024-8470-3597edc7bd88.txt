Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders
Q. Mr. President, have you given up on a utility tax, and how much of an increase would you take on a gas tax? And besides thatâ€”
The President. Well, I'm just sitting here meeting with the chairmen, and I'm going to also, you know, keep working through this with the conferees. And we're going to see what we can do. But we're just beginning our conversations, so I can't answer those questions.
Q. Sir, what qualifications will the new FBI Director have?
The President. Good ones.
