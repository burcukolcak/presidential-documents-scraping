[The President's remarks are joined in progress.]
The President.——have a briefing from all the folks who have been working on this terrible tragedy, making an effort to recover the bodies as quickly as possible and find out what caused the crash. And I'm looking forward to that briefing and having a chance to thank them for the efforts they've made and then to go over and meet with the families.
I want to thank the Members of the Congress, the Governor, and other officials from New York, and particularly the Ambassadors from France and Italy for being here with me. And I'm anxious to get on with the morning.
Thank you.
Q.Are you satisfied with the efforts to recover the bodies even as the search for clues as to the cause of this tragedy is underway?
The President.I will have a statement after we meet this morning, and I'd prefer to wait and answer all my questions then.
Thank you.
