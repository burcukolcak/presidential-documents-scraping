Statement on the National Rural Conference
Rural America, which makes up a quarter of our population, is vital to the overall development of our Nation's economy and future. This administration is committed to working closely with rural communities in tackling the important issues of jobs, trade, and the preservation of the family farm as our Nation enters the next century.
