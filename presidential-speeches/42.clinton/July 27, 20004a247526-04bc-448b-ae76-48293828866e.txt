Radio Remarks on Restoration of the Wild Salmon of the Pacific Northwest
Today my administration is proposing a comprehensive strategy to bring back the wild salmon of the Pacific Northwest. We'll pursue a practical course that will help both the economy and the environment. Congress must also do its part by fully funding my salmon restoration budget, and the people of the Pacific Northwest must be prepared to take the necessary steps. Only in partnership with State and tribal governments and other stakeholders can we restore the salmon without resorting to costlier measures. I welcome the recommendations of the region's Governors and look forward to working together to ensure our success.
NOTE: The President's remarks were recorded at 2:30 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House for immediate broadcast. These remarks were also made available on the White House Press Office Actuality Line.
