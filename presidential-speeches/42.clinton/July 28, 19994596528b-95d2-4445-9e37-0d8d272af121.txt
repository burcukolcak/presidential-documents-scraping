Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Burdensharing in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
Dear Mr. Chairman:
Pursuant to section 3 of the resolution of advice and consent to ratification of the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949, on the Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic (the "resolution"), I hereby transmit a report concerning Burdensharing in the Alliance.
This report is comprised of two sections, which provide the information required by section 3(2)(B) of the resolution to the extent that such information is available. The unclassified section covers common NATO budgets, national defense budgets and their adequacy, costs incurred to date in connection with the membership of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and the status of discussions concerning NATO membership for Partnership for Peace countries. A classified addendum covers NATO members' capabilities to deploy and sustain combat forces.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
