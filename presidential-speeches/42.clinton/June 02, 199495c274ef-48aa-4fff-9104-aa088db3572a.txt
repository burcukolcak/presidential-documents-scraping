Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy in Rome
Q.Mr. President, North Korea's being very threatening—making more statements about— the talks that you've undertaken—talks of tough sanctions. What do you say to that?
The President.We're going to have a question period, I think, afterward. The Prime Minister and I will make statements and then answer questions. I'd rather answer questions then.
Q.Any general impressions so far—just about how things are going?
The President.It's been a very good trip so far. I've been very impressed, pleased with the reception, pleased with the support for the United States.
