Remarks on the Downing of a United States Aircraft in Bosnia
Good afternoon. I am very concerned about the loss of our F-16 over Bosnia and the fate of the American pilot, and we are following that situation closely.
I have spoken today with President Chirac about the situation in Bosnia and about the meetings that Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili will be attending. I've spoken with Secretary Perry and will meet with him and General Shali later today. We've also been in touch with the NATO commanders and with other governments.
I want to reiterate and make absolutely clear that our policy on Bosnia remains firm. For reasons that I think are obvious, I will have no further comments on this situation today.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 2:20 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Capt. Scott F. O'Grady, USAF, and President Jacques Chirac of the European Council.
