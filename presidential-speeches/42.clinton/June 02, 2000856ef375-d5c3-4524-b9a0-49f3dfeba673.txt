Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Normal Trade Relations Status for China

I hereby transmit a report including my reasons for determining that continuation of the waiver currently in effect for the People's Republic of China under subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, (the "Act") will substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the Act.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
