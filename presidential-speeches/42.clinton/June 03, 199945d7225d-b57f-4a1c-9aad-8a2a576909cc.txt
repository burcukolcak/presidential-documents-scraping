Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Normal Trade Relations Status for Belarus
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "Act"), with respect to the continuation of a waiver of the application of subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Act. This document constitutes my recommendation to continue in effect this waiver for a further 12-month period, and includes my determination that continuation of the waiver currently in effect for the Republic of Belarus will substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the Act. I will submit separate reports with respect to Vietnam and the People's Republic of China.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The related memorandum is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume. The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, Public Law 105-206, section 5003, changed the term "most-favored-nation" status to "normal trade relations" status.
