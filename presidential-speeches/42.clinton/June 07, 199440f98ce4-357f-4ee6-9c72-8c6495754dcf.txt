Statement on Assistance to California
Californians have been working extraordinarily hard to get their homes, their businesses, and their lives back to normal. This is creating unexpected and unprecedented need for assistance from the Federal Government. This recommendation should assure the people of southern California that our commitment to help them get back on their feet remains strong and unwavering.
NOTE: The statement was included in a statement by the Press Secretary on the President's request to Congress for additional funds to assist the State of California in the wake of the earthquake earlier this year.
