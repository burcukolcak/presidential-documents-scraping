Statement on Handgun Control Legislation
The Justice Department's report on background checks is further proof that the Brady law is working. Since its passage, law enforcement officials have stopped hundreds of thousands of felons, fugitives, and stalkers from buying handguns every year. By keeping guns out of the hands of criminals—and putting more police in our communities—we have helped cut the crime rate to its lowest point in a generation. We must now extend the Brady law's provisions to violent juveniles and bar them from owning guns for life. I call on Congress once again to pass this needed, commonsense legislation.
