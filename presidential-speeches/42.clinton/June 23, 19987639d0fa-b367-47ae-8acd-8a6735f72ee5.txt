Statement on Congressional Action on Internal Revenue Service Reform Legislation
For months now, I have urged Congress to do more to help the American taxpayer. Today I am pleased that the House and Senate have finally reached a bipartisan agreement to reform the IRS and strengthen taxpayer rights. We need an IRS that reflects American values and respects American taxpayers. This bill goes a long way toward that goal, and I look forward to signing it into law.
