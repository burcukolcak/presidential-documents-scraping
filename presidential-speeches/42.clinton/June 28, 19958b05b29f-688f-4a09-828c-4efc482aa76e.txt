Memorandum on Upgrading Security at Federal Facilities
Memorandum for Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject:Upgrading Security at Federal Facilities
I have received from the Department of Justice a study entitled, "Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities." In order to ensure adequate security for Federal facilities, I am adopting immediately a number of the recommendations of the Department of Justice Study.
I hereby direct that:
1. Each Federal facility shall, where feasible, be upgraded to the minimum security standards recommended for its security level by the Department of Justice Study;
2. All executive departments and agencies ("agencies") shall immediately begin upgrading their facilities to meet the recommended minimum security standards, to the extent possible within currently available funding;
3. By October 15, 1995, the General Services Administration (GSA), those agencies with facilities in Security Level IV GSA space, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall identify funding, no later than in the FY97 budget cycle, for the cost of upgrading Level IV facilities to the minimum security standards recommended by the Department of Justice Study;
4. By February 1, 1996, GSA and all agencies shall consult with OMB regarding funding mechanisms for upgrading all remaining Federal facilities to the minimum security standards recommended by the Department of Justice Study; and
5. All agencies shall adhere to the attached timetable for implementing this directive.
I also have directed OMB to review the remaining recommendations of the Department of Justice Study, and to advise me within 30 days from the date of this memorandum concerning the implementation of those recommendations.
