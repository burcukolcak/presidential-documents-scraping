Radio Remarks on the Observance of Independence Day, 1999
This weekend, as we celebrate the 223d anniversary of the Declaration of Independence and the birthday of our great Nation, let us reflect on what it means to be an American.
Let us remember the visionaries, the patriots, and the soldiers who were inspired by a single ideal, that we are all created equal; and let us strive to honor that ideal today and every day by building a world where every individual can make the most of his or her talents and know what it truly means to live and breathe free.
On this, the last Independence Day of the 20th century, Hillary and I wish you a happy and memorable Fourth of July.
NOTE: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 1 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House for broadcast on July 4. The transcript was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on July 2. These remarks were also made available on the White House Press Office Radio Actuality Line.
