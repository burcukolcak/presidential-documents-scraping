Message to the Congress on Trade With Ukraine
To the Congress of the United States:
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Ukraine to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers dutyfree access to the U.S. market and is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974.
I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, and particularly Ukraine's level of development and initiation of economic reforms, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Ukraine.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House,
March 3, 1994.
