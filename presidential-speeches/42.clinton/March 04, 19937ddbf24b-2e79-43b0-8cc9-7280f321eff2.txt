Letter to the Acting Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Disaster Assistance for Washington
Dear Mr. Tidball:
I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of Washington, resulting from severe storms and high winds on January 2021, 1993, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant a major disaster declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ("the Stafford Act"). I, therefore, declare that such a major disaster exists in the State of Washington.
In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to allocate from funds available for these purposes, such amounts as you find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative expenses.
You are authorized to provide Public Assistance in the designated areas. Consistent with the requirement that Federal assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided tinder the Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the total eligible costs.
Sincerely,
BILL CLINTON
