Radio Remarks on Proposed Airline Passenger Protection Legislation
Our country's airlines serve millions of Americans a year, but as more planes are taking off, so are passenger complaints. That's why I'm proposing a new law requiring all airlines to spell out how they will address problems such as delays, overbooking, and missing baggage. This airline passenger protection act has overwhelming bipartisan support. With its passage, we can make the best airline system in the world even better.
NOTE: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 4:15 p.m. on March 5 in the Oval Office at the White House for later broadcast. These remarks were also made available on the White House Press Office Radio Actuality Line.
