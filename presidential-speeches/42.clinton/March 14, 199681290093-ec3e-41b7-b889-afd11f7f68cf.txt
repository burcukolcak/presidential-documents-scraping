Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With Likud Party Leader Binyamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem
Q.Mr. President, if Mr. Netanyahu comes into power, will you cooperate with him as deeply as you cooperate with Prime Minister Peres?
The President.I will certainly cooperate with him. Israel is a democracy. The Israeli voters will make their decision in a few weeks, and the United States relationship with Israel is deep, strong, and enduring. Of course I would.
And I don't think there is much partisan difference in our country or yours on this question of fighting against terrorism. It's one of the great challenges the world faces. We've go to do a better job. We've got to strengthen it.
NOTE: The exchange began at 12:10 p.m. in the Presidential suite at the Laromme Hotel. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
