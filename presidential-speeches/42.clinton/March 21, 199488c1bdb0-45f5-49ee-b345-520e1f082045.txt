Statement on Emergency Assistance to the Northeast Fishing Industry
New England's fisheries are experiencing a virtual collapse, threatening the livelihoods of thousands of New Englanders. The first step to recovery is to restore the supply of fish, and we are working to do that by restricting fishing. But we must address the economic impact that is being felt by individuals, businesses, and communities. These resources are targeted to specific programs that will help the industry, help people, and help communities get back on their feet.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing emergency supplemental appropriations to assist the Northeast fishing industry and communities affected by the collapse of Northeast commercial fisheries.
