Statement on the Attack at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Arkansas
Like all Americans, Hillary and I are deeply shocked and heartbroken by this afternoon's horrifying events at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Arkansas.
We don't know now and we may never fully understand what could have driven two youths to deliberately shoot into a crowd of their classmates.
Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and the entire Jonesboro community.
NOTE: In the statement, the President referred to Andrew Golden, 11, and Mitchell Johnson, 13, students at Westside Middle School, who fired on other students during a fire drill, killing four students and a teacher.
