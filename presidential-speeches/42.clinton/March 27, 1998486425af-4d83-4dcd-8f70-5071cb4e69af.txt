Videotaped Remarks to Tracey Brown From Cape Town, South Africa
Tracey, I wish you could have been with us when we heard President Rawlings in Ghana, President Museveni in Uganda, talking about your father and how much he did for Africa and how much he did to bring America and Africa in closer contact. And of course, on Saturday in Johannesburg, we dedicated the Ron Brown Commercial Center—your mom was there—to your dad's memory. His legacy will live on here because the center will promote economic progress and individual empowerment and democracy.
Let me say that I've actually read your book from start to finish, and I loved it. And your daddy would be proud of it. And it's just sort of sassy and braggy enough to be right where he was. [Laughter] So I hope you sell a zillion copies. You certainly deserve it, and I'm very, very proud of you.
NOTE: These remarks were videotaped at approximately 5:05 p.m. in the library at the Cape Grace Hotel, to congratulate Ms. Brown on the publication of her biography of her father, "The Life and Times of Ron Brown." In his remarks, the President referred to Ms. Brown's mother, Alma Brown. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included the opening remarks of the First Lady.
