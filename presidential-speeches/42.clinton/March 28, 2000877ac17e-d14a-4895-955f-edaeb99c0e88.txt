Radio Remarks on Sightseeing Flights Over the Grand Canyon
There may be no place on Earth more stunning than the Grand Canyon. It's important to preserve and protect it, so that the millions who visit each year can enjoy the Canyon in all its splendor. Today I am announcing an important new measure to carefully manage sightseeing flights over the Grand Canyon. With this action, we can allow continued access to all, while also helping to restore the natural quiet of this timeless treasure.
NOTE: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 8 p.m. on March 17 in the Oval Office at the White House for later broadcast. The transcript was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on March 28. These remarks were also made available on the White House Press Office Actuality Line.
