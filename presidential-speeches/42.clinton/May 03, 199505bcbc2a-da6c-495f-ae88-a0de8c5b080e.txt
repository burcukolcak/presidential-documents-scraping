Statement on Initiatives To Combat Medicare and Medicaid Fraud
These initiatives are the right way to control health care costs and protect Medicare for our senior citizens. They will help ensure that Medicare dollars, on which so many of our seniors rely, go to the people who deserve them.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing a crackdown on fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid as an outgrowth of the effort to reinvent Government.
