Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Democracy Promotion Programs
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I am pleased to transmit herewith a report on the democracy promotion programs funded by the United States Government. The report is required by section 534 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (Public Law 103-236).
The report reviews the current status of U.S.sponsored programs to promote democracy. As part of the Vice President's National Performance Review, agencies will be seeking ways to further streamline these programs in the coming months.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
