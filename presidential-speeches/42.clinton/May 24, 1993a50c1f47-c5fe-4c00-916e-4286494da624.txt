Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President Richard von Weizsacker of Germany
Bosnia
Q. Mr. President, have you been surprised or disappointed by the reaction in Bosnia and Serbia-
The President. You mean, the opposition to it?
Q. The opposition and the initial support from Mr. Karadzic.
The President. No, it's about like I expected it to be.
Q.[Inaudible]—U.N. observers into Serbian territory, how does that complicate things?
The President. I don't want to say any more about it now. I want to talk to the President about it. We'll try to just absorb what has been said and make the appropriate decision. But I'm not particularly surprised by the various responses—
Q. Mr. President, do you hope this week goes better than last week?
The President. We had a good week last week. The Ways and Means Committee voted the bill out—signed the motor voter bill.
