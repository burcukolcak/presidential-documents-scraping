Letter Accepting the Resignation of David Watkins as Assistant to the President for Management and Administration
Dear David:
I write to accept your resignation and to say that I understand your reasons for submitting it.
At the same time, it should be stated that you undertook your assignment as Assistant to the President for Management and Administration with great vigor and effectiveness. During your tenure, we changed and upgraded the technology upon which this White House depends and future White Houses will depend; from telephones to computers, you brought us into the modern age. Moreover, you opened this house—the people's house—literally to thousands more visitors than had ever been welcomed here in White House history. For these, and many other accomplishments large and small, you deserve great credit.
Hillary and I will never forget the loyal friendship you and Ileene have given to us over the years.
Sincerely,
BILL
NOTE: A letter of resignation from David Watkins to the President and a letter from Chief of Staff Thomas F. (Mack) McLarty to Mr. Watkins were also made available by the Office of the Press Secretary.
