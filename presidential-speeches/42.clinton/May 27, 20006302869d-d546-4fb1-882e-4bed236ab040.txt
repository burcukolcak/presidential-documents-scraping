Statement on the Ulster Unionist Council Vote in Northern Ireland
I am delighted that, with today's historic developments, the Northern Ireland peace process is back on track. I congratulate David Trimble and the Ulster Unionist Council on their decision to return to self-government in Northern Ireland. This is a giant step toward fulfillment of the historic promise of the Good Friday accord to provide self-government to all the people on the basis of equality, consent, and the use of exclusively peaceful means. The parties are now ready to reenter the Executive and Legislative Assembly in the coming days. It is now possible for the politics of conflict to be transformed into the politics of consensus. I applaud the leadership of Tony Blair, Bertie Ahern, and all the parties. The wind is back in the sails of peace in Northern Ireland.
NOTE: The statement referred to Ulster Unionist Party leader and Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble; Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom; and Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland.
