Radio Remarks on Expanding a Wildlife Refuge To Protect the Salmon Habitat in the Columbia River
Today I announced the expansion of a wildlife refuge to protect the prime salmon habitat along the Columbia River. This supports our treaty with Canada to protect Pacific Coast salmon.
My budget proposes increases for salmon restoration, but Congress has provided only a fraction of the resources necessary to do the job. So, again, I call on Congress to provide the necessary resources to support this treaty and to work with me on a budget process that observes our obligations and protects and preserves our environment.
NOTE: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 12:15 p.m. at the Hermitage Tomato Cooperative Association. These remarks were also made available on the White House Press Office Radio Actuality Line.
