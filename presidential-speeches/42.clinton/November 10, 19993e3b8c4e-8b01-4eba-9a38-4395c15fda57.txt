I am very pleased that the Senate has confirmed Carol Moseley-Braun to be our Nation's Ambassador to New Zealand. The Senate's overwhelming bipartisan vote is a strong endorsement of her outstanding experience and credentials for this position. I appreciate her willingness to take on this responsibility, and I expect her to do a superior job representing our country's interests in New Zealand.
