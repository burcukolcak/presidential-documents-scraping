Statement on Signing the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1995
Today I have signed into law H.R. 2394, the "Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1995."
In signing H.R. 2394, I am pleased to extend a most deserved benefit to our Nation's servicedisabled veterans and the surviving spouses and children of those who made the supreme sacrifice in defense of our freedom. In acting to maintain the value of these payments, we keep faith with those who have given so much in service to us all.
The Act provides a 2.6 percent increase in compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation benefits, effective December 1, 1995. This is the same percentage increase that Social Security beneficiaries and veterans' pension recipients will be receiving in January.
On Veterans Day, we paused to salute all men and women in uniform. Today, it is altogether fitting that we give tangible expression to our enduring commitment to honor our obligations to them.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, November 22, 1995.
