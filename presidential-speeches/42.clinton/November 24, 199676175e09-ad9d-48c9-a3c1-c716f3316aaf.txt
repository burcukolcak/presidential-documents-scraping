Discussions With President Jiang Zemin of China
Q.Could you give us your assessment of your meeting with the Chinese leader?
The President.Well, I'm sure you've gotten a report. I think it went very well. It was a good meeting, and I think that the next steps were appropriate.
Q.You're looking forward, then, to going to Beijing?
The President.Very much.
Discussions With Prime Minister Hashimoto
Q.Mr. Prime Minister, the last time you met with Mr. Clinton, you gave him a saxophone. What are you going to do this time to make him happy? [Laughter]
The President.And I played it, too.
Prime Minister Hashimoto.What should I do about that? I think you're giving me more difficult questions than you're giving to the President. Well, it's a diplomatic secret. [Laughter]
