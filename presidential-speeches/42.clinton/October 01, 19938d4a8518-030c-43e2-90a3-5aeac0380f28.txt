Statement on Emergency Assistance to Earthquake Victims in India
The people of the United States are shocked and saddened by the devastating earthquake that has taken thousands of lives and left thousands more homeless. I have directed our Government to take immediate action to help ease the suffering. I have also asked Ambassador Ray Flynn to accompany the supplies, to assess the situation, and report back to me.
NOTE: The President's statement was included in a White House statement announcing that the President had directed the Defense Department and the Agency for International Development to provide humanitarian assistance to earthquake victims in India.
