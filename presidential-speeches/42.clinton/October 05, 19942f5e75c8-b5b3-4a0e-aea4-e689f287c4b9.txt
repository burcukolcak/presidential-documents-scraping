Remarks Prior to Discussions With President Nelson Mandela of South Africa
Hello, everybody. Let me say very brieflyâ€” as you know, President Mandela and I will have statements and answer questions after we have our meeting. But I do want to say again how pleased we are to have him here. This has been both a summit meeting and a celebration for so many Americans who have so strongly supported South African democracy. And now we're in the process of working on the future, planning for the future, and seeing what we can do to be of help.
And I'm looking forward to this meeting. And as I said, we'll be glad to answer your questions after it occurs.
NOTE: The President spoke at 2:30 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
