Statement on the Withdrawal of the Nomination of Shirley Chisholm To Be Ambassador to Jamaica
I deeply regret that illness has forced Shirley Chisholm to ask that her nomination to be our country's Ambassador to Jamaica be withdrawn. As I said when I first announced my decision to nominate her, Shirley Chisholm is a true pioneer of American politics. Even before she ran for elective office, she had made her mark through her work teaching the children of New York and through the force of her remarkable personality. As the U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica, she would have been a powerful voice for cooperation and justice.
Hillary and I both wish Shirley Chisholm all the best at this difficult time. She is in our thoughts and in our prayers.
NOTE: The President's statement was included in a White House statement announcing the withdrawal of the nomination.
