Statement on Federal Funding for the Homeless
I am pleased to announce the release of these much-needed funds to help feed, shelter, and give a hand up to America's homeless. By involving local community organizations as we decide where to best allocate these resources, we will ensure that the most urgent needs in our communities are met.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing the release of $130 million in funding to feed and shelter the homeless.
