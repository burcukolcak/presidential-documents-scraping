Statement on Signing the Executive Order on Federal Acquisition, Recycling, and Waste Prevention
Families, businesses, and communities all across America know that recycling makes sense. It saves money and it protects the environment. It's time for the Government to set an example and provide real leadership that will help create jobs and protect the environment, encouraging new markets for recycled products and new technologies.
NOTE: The President's statement was included in a White House announcement on the signing of the Executive order, which is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
