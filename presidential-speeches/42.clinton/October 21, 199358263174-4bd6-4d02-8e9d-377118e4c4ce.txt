Statement on Signing the Continuing Appropriations Resolution
Today I have signed into law H.J. Res. 281, a Continuing Resolution that funds the operations of the Federal Government during October 22-28, 1993.
A Continuing Resolution is necessary at this time in order to keep the Government functioning while the Congress completes the appropriations process.
I commend the Congress for presenting me with a funding measure that provides for a simple, temporary extension of normal government operations and is free of extraneous amendments. I urge the Congress to complete the regular appropriations process by October 28th so that an additional Continuing Resolution can be avoided.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, October 21, 1993.
NOTE: H.J. Res. 281, approved October 21, was assigned Public Law No. 103-113. This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on October 22.
