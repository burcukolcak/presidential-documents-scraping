Statement on Harold Ickes' 1996 Campaign Financing Activities
Harold Ickes has been an important part of this administration's efforts to move our country forward and has devoted much of his life to improving the lives of all Americans. He has been a trusted adviser and a dedicated public servant. I am confident that investigators will find he acted lawfully and appropriately.
NOTE: Mr. Ickes was formerly Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Political Affairs.
