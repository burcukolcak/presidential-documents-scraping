Statement on the Northern Ireland Peace Process
Yesterday's announcement that Martin McGuinness will oversee decommissioning issues for Sinn Fein is an important step. I welcome it as the kind of action essential not only to fulfill the Good Friday commitments, but to deepen public confidence in the overall process of making peace a reality in Northern Ireland.
NOTE: The statement referred to Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein chief negotiator.
