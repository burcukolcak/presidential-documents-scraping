Statement on the Conclusion of the Independent Counsel's Investigation of Henry G. Cisneros
Henry has been a dedicated public official who served the American people and this administration with distinction. He is also a good friend. I am pleased that this matter is finally behind him, and I wish him and his family all the best.
