Statement on Implementation of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993
This law creates the opportunity to include millions of Americans in the political process who have previously been excluded because of difficult and confusing voting rules. I urge all Americans of all political parties to register to vote, and I urge the voter registration groups to continue and expand their efforts to ensure as many of our citizens as possible are registered.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing the Executive order of September 12 on implementation of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. The Executive order is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
