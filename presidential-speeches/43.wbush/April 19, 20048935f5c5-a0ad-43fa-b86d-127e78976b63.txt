Remarks Announcing the Nomination of John D. Negroponte To Be Ambassador to Iraq
The President.Today I'm announcing my intention to nominate Ambassador John Negroponte as the Ambassador to Iraq. Ambassador Negroponte now serves our Nation at the United Nations as the Ambassador there. He has done a really good job of speaking for the United States to the world about our intentions to spread freedom and peace. John Negroponte is a man of enormous experience and skill. Therefore, I'm comfortable in asking him to serve in this very difficult assignment. No doubt in my mind he can handle it. No doubt in my mind he'll do a very good job. And there's no doubt in my mind that Iraq will be free and democratic and peaceful.
So, John, thank you for agreeing to serve your country yet once again. I'm proud of your service. Good luck to you. Thank you.
Ambassador Negroponte.Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you.
The President.You bet.
Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 1:51 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House.
