Statement on Senate Action on Defense Appropriations Legislation
I applaud the Senate for answering my call to quickly pass the Defense appropriations bill. With our Nation at war, it is imperative that we address the important priority of ensuring that our troops have the resources they need. I urge the House and Senate to resolve their differences promptly and send a bill to my desk in early September.
