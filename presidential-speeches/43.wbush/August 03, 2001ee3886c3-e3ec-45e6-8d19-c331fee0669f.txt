Statement on Senate Action on Emergency Agricultural Assistance Legislation
The Senate today took wise and prompt action to help America's farmers. This vote is a victory for our Nation's farmers at a time when they need it the most. I praise the Senate for agreeing to the House bill and look forward to signing this helpful measure into law.
