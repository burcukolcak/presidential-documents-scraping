Remarks in Kennebunkport, Maine, on the Bombings in the Middle East
Good morning. I'm distressed to hear about the latest suicide bombers in Israel. For those who yearn for peace in the Middle East, for those in the Arab lands, for those in Europe, for those all around the world who yearn for peace, we must do everything we possibly can to stop the terror.
There are a few killers who want to stop the peace process that we have started, and we must not let them. For the sake of humanity, for the sake of the Palestinians who suffer, for the sake of the Israelis who are under attack, we must stop the terror.
I call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these terrorist killers.
Thank you.
Now watch this drive.
NOTE:  The President spoke at 6:15 a.m. at the Cape Arundel Golf Club, prior to a round of golf. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
