Remarks in Waco, Texas, on the Death of Peter Jennings
Laura and I were saddened to learn about the death of Peter Jennings. Peter Jennings had a long and distinguished career as a news journalist. He covered many important events, events that helped define the world as we know it today. A lot of Americans relied upon Peter Jennings for their news. He became a part of the lives of a lot of our fellow citizens, and he will be missed. May God bless his soul.
Thank you.
