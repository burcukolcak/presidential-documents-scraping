Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the District of Columbia's Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Request
Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to my constitutional authority and as contemplated by section 446 of The District of Columbia Self-Governmental Reorganization Act as amended in 1989, I am transmitting the District of Columbia's 2008 Budget Request Act. This transmittal does not represent an endorsement of the contents of the D.C. government's requests.
The proposed 2008 Budget Request Act reflects the major programmatic objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia. For 2008, the District estimates total revenues and expenditures of $8.38 billion.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate.
