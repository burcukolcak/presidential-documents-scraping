Remarks on the Resignation of Deputy Chief of Staff and Senior Adviser Karl Rove
Karl Rove is moving on down the road. I've been talking to Karl for a while about his desire to spend more time with Darby and Andrew. This is a family that has made enormous sacrifices, not only for our beloved State of Texas but for a country we both love.
Now, we've been friends for a long time, and we're still going to be friends. I would call Karl Rove a dear friend. We've known each other as youngsters interested in serving our State. We worked together so we could be in a position to serve this country. And so I thank my friend. I'll be on the road behind you here in a little bit. I thank Darby and I thank Karl for making a tremendous sacrifice, and I wish you all the very best.
NOTE: The President spoke at 11:31 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Darby, wife, and Andrew, son, of Deputy Chief of Staff Rove. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included the remarks of Deputy Chief of Staff Rove.
