Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with section 620C(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration on progress toward a negotiated solution of the Cyprus question covering the period June 1, 2002, through July 31, 2002. The previous submission covered events from April 1, 2002, through May 31, 2002.
Direct talks on the island between Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash continue under United Nations auspices, although the leaders failed to meet their stated objective of a comprehensive settlement by June 2002. As in past reporting periods, Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas G. Weston and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Donald K. Bandler provided diplomatic support to the process. The United States remains committed to the United Nations effort to find a just and lasting settlement to the Cyprus problem.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
NOTE:  Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Joseph R. Biden, Jr., chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on August 21.
