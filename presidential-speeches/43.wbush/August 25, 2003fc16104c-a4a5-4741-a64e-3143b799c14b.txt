Statement on the Death of John J. Rhodes
John Rhodes was a statesman and a leader in the United States Congress. He was admired by Republicans and Democrats alike for his 30 years of tireless work for the people he represented and the country he loved. Laura joins me in sending our thoughts and prayers to his wife, Elizabeth, and the entire Rhodes family.
