Remarks on Presenting the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor
You know, one of the wonderful experiences of being a President is to welcome citizens who have served their communities with valor and compassion. And I—General and I are surrounded by four such gentlemen who have been heroic in their duties. They will tell you they were just doing their job; I'm telling you they did their job with extraordinary courage. And so it's been an honor to award them this precious medal. And I want to thank you all very much for joining us. Proud to call you fellow citizens.
NOTE: The President spoke at 2:11 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey.
