Statement on Congressional Passage of Legislation To Help the Gulf Coast Rebuild Following Hurricanes Rita and Katrina
I commend the Congress for passing an important part of my comprehensive plan to help the citizens of the gulf coast rebuild their lives and their livelihoods. The private sector is critical in the rebuilding effort, and these tax incentives will help boost investment, get people back to work, and return the region to prosperity. Americans will continue to stand with our fellow citizens in the gulf coast region. I look forward to signing this bill into law.
