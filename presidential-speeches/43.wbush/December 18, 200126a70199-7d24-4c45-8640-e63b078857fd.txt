Statement on Signing the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002
Today I have signed into law H.R. 2299, the "Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002."
I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has gone into producing this Act. The bill abides by the agreed upon aggregate funding level for Fiscal Year 2002 of $686 billion and supports several of my Administration's key initiatives with:
Several provisions in the bill purport to require congressional approval before executive branch execution of aspects of the bill. I will interpret such provisions to require notification only, since any other interpretation would contradict the Supreme Court ruling inINSv.Chadha.

NOTE: H.R. 2299, approved December 18, was assigned Public Law No. 107-87.
