Remarks on Signing a Bill To Prevent Taxation of Payments From the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund to Virginia Tech Victims and Families
It's my honor to welcome the president of Virginia Tech, the mayor of Blacksburg, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and of course, distinguished membersof the congressional delegation here as I sign a bill that's going to help the folks who suffered mightily on that day when a gunman killed their loved ones. It's a good piece of legislation. I appreciate members from both parties working on it.
And I asked the president howâ€”what the spirits are like there at Virginia Tech, and he said they're strong. And I'm not surprised. Having been there for that memorial ceremony, I left with the distinct impression that of all the communities in America that could deal with a tragedy, it's the Virginia Tech community.
And so I want to say to the families who still suffer, we think about you. And to the students and faculty and alumni and leadership of Virginia Tech, thank you for helping those who suffer reconcile and recover from the grief they feel. So it's my honor to sign this important piece of legislation.
NOTE: The President spoke at 11:37 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Charles W. Steger, president, Virginia Tech University; Mayor Ron Rordam of Blacksburg, VA; and Gov. Timothy M. Kaine of Virginia. H.R. 4118, approved December 19, was assigned Public Law No. 110-141.
