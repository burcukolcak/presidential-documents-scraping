Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Notice of Intention To Enter Into a Free Trade Agreement With Australia
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002 (the "Trade Act"), I am pleased to notify the Congress of my intent to enter into a free trade agreement (FTA) with the Government of Australia.
This agreement will create new opportunities for America's workers, farmers, businesses, and consumers by eliminating barriers in trade with Australia. Australia is already a major trade and investment partner of the United States, as well as one of the strongest and most dependable friends this country has ever had. This agreement will provide opportunities to further deepen this important relationship, for the mutual benefit of our two nations.
Consistent with the Trade Act, I am sending this notification at least 90 days in advance of signing the United States-Australia FTA. My Administration looks forward to working with the Congress in developing appropriate legislation to approve and implement this free trade agreement.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate. The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
