Remarks on the Situation in the Middle East
Good morning. I strongly condemn the terrible act of violence in Israel this morning. I have called Prime Minister Barak to express my condolences to the families of the people killed and to all the Israeli people.
As I told the Prime Minister, the tragic cycle of violent action and reaction between Israel and the Palestinians, particularly the escalation this week, needs to stop. I'm urging all parties to do their utmost to end the violence.
We will continue to work with all parties to try to restore calm to the region.
Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 8:55 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White House, prior to his departure for Charleston, WV. In his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel.
