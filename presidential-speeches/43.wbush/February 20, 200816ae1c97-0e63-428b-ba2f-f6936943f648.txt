Remarks During a Lunch With Peace Corps Volunteers in Accra
Ambassador, thank you very much for setting up this lunch. Laura and I and Condi are thrilled to be with some of our most notable citizens. These are folks who have left the comfort of America to join the Peace Corps to serve humanity, and we're really looking forward to hearing your stories and hearing what life is like.
And one of the things I tell our country all the time is, our great strength lies in the hearts and souls of our citizens. And I don't think there's any more giving people than the Peace Corps volunteers. And so, Robert, thank you very much for joining us and bringing along some of the—our fellow citizens who are making a huge difference in people's lives.
I'm sure you would like to share a few remarks.
