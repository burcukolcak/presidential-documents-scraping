Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Legislation To Protect Unborn Victims of Violence
I applaud the House for passing the "Unborn Victims of Violence Act" today by a strong bipartisan vote. We must continue to build a culture of life in our country, a compassionate society in which every child is born into a loving family and protected by law.
Pregnant women who have been harmed by violence, and their families, know that there are two victims—the mother and the unborn child—and both victims should be protected by Federal law.
I urge the Senate to pass this bill so that I can sign it into law.
NOTE: The statement referred to H.R. 1997.
