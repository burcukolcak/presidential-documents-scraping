Letter to Congressional Leaders on Modifying Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of Preferences To Include Afghanistan
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Afghanistan to the list of beneficiary developing countries and to the list of least-developed beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. In light of these criteria, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP beneficiary developing country and least-developed beneficiary developing country benefits to Afghanistan.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(f) of the Trade Act of 1974.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
