Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a Request for Funding for the Department of Homeland Security
Dear Madam Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed request for the Department of Homeland Security. The request is needed to liquidate prior-year obligations for contracts and grants made by the Transportation Security Administration. The request is fully offset by transferring unobligated balances and would not increase spending or the deficit.
The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
