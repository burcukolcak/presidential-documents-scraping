Letter to Congressional Leaders Submitting Proposed Legislative Changes To Implement the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
On May 18, 2004, the United States Trade Representative signed the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement on behalf of the United States. Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(B) of the Trade Act of 2002, I am submitting a description of the changes to existing laws, prepared by my Administration, that would be required to bring the United States into compliance with that agreement.
I look forward to working with the Congress in developing legislation to implement this free trade agreement with an important economic partner and close ally.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate.
