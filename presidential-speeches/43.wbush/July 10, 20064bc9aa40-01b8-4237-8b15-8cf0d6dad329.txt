Statement on a Report of the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba
Today I approved the second report of the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba. I also approved a Compact with the People of Cuba, which outlines how the United States will support the Cuban people as they transition from the repressive control of the Castro regime to freedom and a genuine democracy. The report demonstrates that we are actively working for change in Cuba, not simply waiting for change. I call on all our democratic friendsand allies around the world to join us in supporting freedom for the Cuban people. I applaud the work of the Commission, cochaired by Secretary Rice and Secretary Gutierrez.
NOTE: The statement referred to President Fidel Castro Ruz of Cuba. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of this statement.
