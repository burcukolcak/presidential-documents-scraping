Statement on the Death of Celia Cruz
Celia Cruz was an international artist whose voice and talent entertained audiences around the world. Her success in the years following her departure from her beloved Cuba was a tribute to her perseverance, compassion, and love for life. Laura joins me in sending our thoughts and prayers to her family and friends.
