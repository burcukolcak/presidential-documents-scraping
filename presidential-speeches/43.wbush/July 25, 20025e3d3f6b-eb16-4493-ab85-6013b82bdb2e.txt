Statement on Senate Action on Corporate Accountability Legislation
Today's passage by Congress of corporate accounting reforms is a victory for America's shareholders and employees. House and Senate passage of this legislation demonstrates what can happen when leaders work together to solve problems. I look forward to signing these important reforms into law. In February I also proposed tough changes to reform employee pension programs, and the House quickly responded. I urge the Senate to act before they recess to protect the savings of America's workers.
