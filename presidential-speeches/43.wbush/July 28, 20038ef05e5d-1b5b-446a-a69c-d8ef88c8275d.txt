Remarks at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, on the Death of Bob Hope
Today America lost a great citizen. We mourn the passing of Bob Hope. Bob Hope made us laugh, and he lifted our spirits. Bob Hope served our Nation when he went to battlefields to entertain thousands of troops from different generations. We extend our prayers to his family, and we mourn the loss of a good man. May God bless his soul.
Thank you all.
NOTE: The President spoke at 9:50 a.m. prior to departure for Pittsburgh, PA. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
