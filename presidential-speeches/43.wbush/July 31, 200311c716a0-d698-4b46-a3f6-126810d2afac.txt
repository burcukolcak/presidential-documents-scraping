Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Reallocation of Funds Previously Transferred From the Emergency Response Fund
Dear Mr. Speaker:
In order to continue responses necessary as a result of the September 11th terrorist attacks, I am notifying the Congress of my intent to reallocate funds previously transferred from the Emergency Response Fund (ERF).
At this time, $1.2 million of ERF funds will be transferred to the United States Trade Representative to support increased security at international trade negotiations.
The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
