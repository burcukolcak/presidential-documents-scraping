Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iraq
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in theFederal Registerand transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. Consistent with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice, stating that the Iraq emergency is to continue in effect beyond August 2, 2003, to theFederal Registerfor publication. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was published in theFederal Registeron August 1, 2002, (67Fed. Reg.50341).
The crisis that led to the declaration of a national emergency on August 2, 1990, has not been fully resolved. The United States, along with its coalition partners, continues to work to stabilize Iraq, identify and dismantle Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, capture former regime leaders, and locate and return Iraqi assets overseas for the benefit of the Iraqi people. As part of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the United States is providing for the temporary governance of Iraq, including the establishment of a process to lead to a new internationally recognized government. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to Iraq.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate. The notice of July 31 is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
