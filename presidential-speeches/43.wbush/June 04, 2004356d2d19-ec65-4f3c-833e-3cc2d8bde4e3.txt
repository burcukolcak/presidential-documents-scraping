Remarks to Reporters in Rome, Italy
National Economy
Today's job report shows that the American economy is strong and it's getting stronger. Two hundred forty eight thousand jobs for last month is good for the American workers. It shows that our economy is vital and growing. We've added 900,000 jobs over the last 3 months and 1.4 million jobs since last August. The policies in place are working. The entrepreneurial spirit is strong. The small-business sector of our economy is vibrant. And I'm pleased the American worker is doing their job.
Thank you.
