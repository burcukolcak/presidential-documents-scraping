Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting Budget Amendments
Dear Madam Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendments to my FY 2009 Budget for the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, the Interior, Labor, and the Treasury. Overall, the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2009 Budget would not be increased by these requests.
I am requesting an additional $546 million for the Department of Commerce to cover increased costs to conduct the 2010 Decennial Census. I am also requesting $275 million for the Department of Health and Human Services to improve food and medical product safety and $1 million for the Department of Homeland Security to continue operations of the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding through February 28, 2009. These amounts are fully offset by reductions to other accounts.
The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
