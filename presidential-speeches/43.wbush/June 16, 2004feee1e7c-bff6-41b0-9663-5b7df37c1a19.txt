Message to the Senate Transmitting the Canada-United States Agreement on Pacific Hake/Whiting
To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada on Pacific Hake/Whiting (the "Agreement"), done at Seattle, November 21, 2003. I am also enclosing, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State on the Agreement.
The Agreement establishes, for the first time, agreed percentage shares of the transboundary stock of Pacific hake, also known as Pacific whiting. It also creates a process through which U.S. and Canadian scientists and fisheries managers will recommend the total catch of Pacific hake each year, to be divided by a set percentage formula. Stakeholders from both countries will have significant input into this process.
The Agreement not only allows the Parties to redress the overfishing that had led to a recent decline in stock levels, but also provides long-term stability for U.S. fishers and processors and a structure for future scientific collaboration.
The recommended legislation necessary to implement the Agreement will be submitted separately to the Congress.
I recommend that the Senate give favorable consideration to this Agreement and give its advice and consent to ratification at an early date.
GEORGE W. BUSH
