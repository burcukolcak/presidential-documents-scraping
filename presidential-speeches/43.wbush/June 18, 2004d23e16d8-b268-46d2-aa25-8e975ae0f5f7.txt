Remarks in Seattle, Washington, on the Death of Paul Johnson
I want to express my deepest condolences to the family of Paul Johnson. We send our prayers and sympathies to them during this very troubling time.
The murder of Paul shows the evil nature of the enemy we face. These are barbaric people. There's no justification whatsoever for his murder, and yet they killed him in cold blood. And it should remind us that we must pursue these people and bring them to justice before they hurt other Americans. See, they're trying to intimidate America. They're trying to shake our will. They're trying to get us to retreat from the world. America will not retreat. America will not be intimidated by these kinds of extremist thugs.
May God bless Paul Johnson. Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 12:54 p.m. at Boeing Field/King County International Airport prior to his departure for Reno, NV. In his remarks, he referred to Paul Johnson, a U.S. citizen employed in Saudi Arabia who was killed by members of the Al Qaida terrorist organization earlier in the day. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
