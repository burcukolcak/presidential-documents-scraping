Statement on Senate Passage of PATRIOT Act Reauthorization Legislation
I applaud the Senate for voting to renew the PATRIOT Act and overcoming the partisan attempts to block its passage. The terrorists have not lost the will or the ability to attack us. The PATRIOT Act is vital to the war on terror and defending our citizens against a ruthless enemy. This bill will allow our law enforcement officials to continue to use the same tools against terrorists that are already used against drug dealers and other criminals, while safeguarding the civil liberties of the American people.
