Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a Request for Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Supplemental Budget Revisions
Dear Madam Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed revisions to the FY 2007 Department of Defense supplemental request proposed in my FY 2008 Budget. This revised request would better align resources based on the assessment of military commanders to achieve the goal of establishing Iraq and Afghanistan as democratic and secure nations that are free of terrorism. Overall, the discretionary budget authority in my FY 2007 supplemental proposal would not be increased by these requests.
The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
