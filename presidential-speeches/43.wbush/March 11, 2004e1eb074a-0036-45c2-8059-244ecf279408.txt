Remarks on the Terrorist Attacks in Madrid, Spain
Today I spoke to His Majesty the King of Spain—Jose Maria Aznar as well—about our country's deepest sympathies toward those who lost their life as a result of terrorist bombings in Spain. I told him we weep with the families. We stand strongly with the people of Spain. I appreciate so very much the Spanish Government's fight against terror, their resolute stand against terrorist organizations like the ETA. The United States stands with them. Today we ask God's blessings on those who suffer in the great country of Spain.
Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 11:51 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White House prior to his departure for Bay Shore, NY. In his remarks, he referred to King Juan Carlos I and President Jose Maria Aznar of Spain; and the Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) separatist group.
