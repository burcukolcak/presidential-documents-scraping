Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Legislation
I applaud the House for passing a budget that protects America, promotes economic growth, supports our priorities, and keeps us on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. It closely follows my budget proposal and reflects our shared commitment to be wise with the people's money and restrain spending in Washington, DC.
