Statement on the Death of John Robson
I am deeply saddened by the death of John Robson. John was a man of true character and integrity. Serving four Presidents with dedication and honor, most recently as Chairman of the Export-Import Bank, John set an example of distinguished public service. I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife, Margaret, and to his son, Doug. He will be missed.
