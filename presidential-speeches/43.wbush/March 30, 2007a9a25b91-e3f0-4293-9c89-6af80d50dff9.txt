Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Notice of Intention To Enter Into a Free Trade Agreement With Panama
Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002, (Public Law 107- 210; the "Trade Act"), I am pleased to notify the Congress of my intention to enter into a free trade agreement with the Republic of Panama.
The United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement (the "Agreement") will generate export opportunities for U.S. farmers, ranchers, and companies, help create jobs in the United States, and help American consumers save money while offering them more choices. The Agreement will also benefit the people of Panama by providing economic opportunity and by strengthening democracy.
Consistent with the Trade Act, I am sending this notification at least 90 days in advance of signing the Agreement. My Administration looks forward to working with the Congress in developing appropriate legislation to approve and implement this Agreement.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate. The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
