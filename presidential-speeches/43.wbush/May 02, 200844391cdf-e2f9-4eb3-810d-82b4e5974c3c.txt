Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a Request for Fiscal Year 2009 Supplemental Appropriations for Ongoing Military and Intelligence Operations and Selected Other International Activities
Dear Madam Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendments to my FY 2009 Budget that provide the necessary resources for ongoing military and intelligence operations, as well as foreign assistance activities in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. They also provide the necessary resources for selected other international activities that advance our national security, including food assistance to address the global food crisis.
These amendments distribute by account $70 billion of discretionary budget authority included as an allowance in my FY 2009 Budget for the Global War on Terror. This amount is already factored into the FY 2009 Budget projections and would not increase the deficit.
I hereby designate the specific proposals in the amounts requested herein as emergency requirements. This request represents urgent and essential requirements. The details of the request are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
