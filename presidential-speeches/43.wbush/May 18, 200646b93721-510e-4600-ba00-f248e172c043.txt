Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Burma
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in theFederal Registerand transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. I have sent the enclosed notice to theFederal Registerfor publication, which states that the Burma emergency is to continue beyond May 20, 2006, for publication. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was published in theFederal Registeron May 18, 2005 (70FR28771).
The crisis between the United States and Burma arising from the actions and policies of the Government of Burma, including its policies of committing large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in Burma, that led to the declaration of a national emergency on May 20, 1997, has not been resolved. These actions and policies are hostile to U.S. interests and pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect to Burma and maintain in force the sanctions against Burma to respond to this threat.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House,
