Message on the Observance of Cuban Independence Day, 2007
I send greetings to all those celebrating the 105th anniversary of Cuba's Independence.
The longing for justice, freedom, and human rights is a desire that can be delayed but never denied. The United States remains committed to extending the fullblessings of liberty around the world, and on this important milestone, we stand united with freedom-loving people of all nations in the conviction that Cuba's future must be one of dignity, liberty, and opportunity.
This day is also an opportunity to recognize the generations of Cuban Americans who have made contributions to our society. Your hard work and high ideals reflect the best of America and enrich our Nation.
Laura and I send our best wishes. May God bless the people of Cuba and all the sons and daughters of Cuba who call America home.
GEORGE W. BUSH
