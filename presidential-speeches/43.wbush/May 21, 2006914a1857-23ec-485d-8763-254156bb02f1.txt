Remarks on the Formation of Iraq's Government
The formation of a unity government in Iraq is a new day for the millions of Iraqis who want to live in freedom. And the formation of the unity Government in Iraq begins a new chapter in our relationship with Iraq.
This morning I called the President, the Prime Minister, and the Speaker to congratulate them on working together to form the unity Government. I assured them that the United States will continue to assist the Iraqis in the formation of a free country, because I fully understand that a free Iraq will be an important ally in the war on terror, will serve as a devastating defeat for the terrorists and Al Qaida, and will serve as an example for others in the region who desire to be free.
Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 8:33 a.m. in the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to President Jalal Talabani, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, and Speaker of the Council of Representatives Mahmoud al-Mashhadani of Iraq.
