Remarks With Judge Priscilla R. Owen on Senate Action To Allow Votes on Judicial Nominations
The President.I'm proud to welcome Judge Priscilla Owen to the Oval Office, along with Leader Frist and my two buddies from the great State of Texas, Senator Hutchison and Senator Cornyn.
Over 4 years ago, I put Judge Owen's name up to the Senate for confirmation to the Fifth Court of Appeals. Thanks to the good work of the leader, whose work cleared the way, Judge Owen is finally going to get an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. She is my friend, and more importantly, she's a great judge.
I want to thank the Texas Senators who have been so strong standing beside Priscilla. There was never any doubt in the Senators' minds that Priscilla Owen is well-qualified to honorably serve on the Federal bench. And it's such aâ€”it's a great day for our friend, to see our friend finally get a just due, after a long, long wait.
So, welcome and congratulations. Perhaps you'd like to say something.
[At this point, Judge Owen made brief remarks.]
The President.Thank you all for coming.
NOTE: The President spoke at 4:51 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included the remarks of Judge Owen.
