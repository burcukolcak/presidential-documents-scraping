Remarks at the Sainte Mere Eglise Church in Sainte Mere Eglise, France
President Chirac, Mrs. Chirac, Mr. Mayor: Laura and I are so honored to be here. Thank you for your hospitality. We are here to pay tribute to those who sacrificed for freedom, both Americans and the French. It is fitting that we remember those who sacrificed because today we defend our freedoms—we defend our freedoms against people who can't stand freedom.
This defense will require the sacrifice of our forefathers, but it's a sacrifice I can promise you we'll make. It's a sacrifice we'll make for the good of America and for the good of France and for the good of freedom all over the world.
It's an honor to be here. May God bless France, and may God bless America. Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 1:05 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to President Jacques Chirac of France and his wife, Bernadette; and Mayor Marc Lefevre of Sainte Mere Eglise.
