Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a Department of Defense Budget Amendment
Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed request for an FY 2003 budget amendment for the Department of Defense reflecting my decision to cancel the Army's Crusader artillery system. The budget totals
proposed in my FY 2003 Budget would not be affected by this amendment.
The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
