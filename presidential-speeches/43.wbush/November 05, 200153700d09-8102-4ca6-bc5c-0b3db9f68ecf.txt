Statement on Signing the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002
Today I have signed into law H.R. 2217, the "Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002."
I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has gone into producing this Act. The bill abides by the agreed upon aggregate funding level for Fiscal Year 2002 of $686 billion and supports several of my Administration's key initiatives with:
I am disappointed that my initiative to increase the Low-Income Weatherization Assistance Program by $120 million was reduced by $43 million in the final version of this bill. This reduction will deny program benefits for over 17,000 low-income families, compared with my request.
Several provisions in the bill purport to require congressional approval before executive branch execution of aspects of the bill. I will interpret such provisions to require notification only, since any other interpretation would contradict the Supreme Court ruling in INS v. Chadha.

The White House, November 5, 2001.
NOTE: H.R. 2217, approved November 5, was assigned Public Law No. 107-63.
