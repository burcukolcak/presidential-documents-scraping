Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in theFederal Registerand transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice, stating that the emergency posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems declared by Executive Order 12938 on November 14, 1994, as amended, is to continue in effect beyond November 14, 2002, to theFederal Registerfor publication. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was published in theFederal Registeron November 13, 2001 (66 FR 56965).
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, I have determined the national emergency previously declared must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2002.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, November 6, 2002.
