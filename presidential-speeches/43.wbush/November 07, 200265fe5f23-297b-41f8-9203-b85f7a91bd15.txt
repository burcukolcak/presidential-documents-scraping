Statement on Signing the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002
Earlier today I signed into law H.R. 4685, the Accountability for Tax Dollars Act. I was pleased to sign this legislation, and I thank Congressman Pat Toomey for his hard work on this bill.
The American people deserve an efficient Government. Requiring agencies to provide accurate financial information helps ensure their accountability.
NOTE: H.R. 4685, approved November 7, was assigned Public Law No. 107-289.
