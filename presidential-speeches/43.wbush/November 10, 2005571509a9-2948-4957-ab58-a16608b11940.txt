Remarks During a Meeting With Louisiana Local Officials
The President.Mayor, thanks for coming.
Mayor C. Ray Nagin.It's good to be here.
The President.And I appreciate you sharing your thoughts and ideas with Don Powell and myself. I appreciate the Commission Chairman for coming and setting out a vision for New Orleans. And I know you've been through an awful lot of tough times, and I really appreciate your working with us to help get this city up and running so the great city of New Orleans will rise once again. As I said in my speech, Mr. Mayor, I can't imagine an America without a New Orleans.
And we've got a lot of work to do, but you're making good progress, and you're showing strong leadership. I appreciate that.
Mayor Nagin.Thank you, Mr. President.
The President.Thank you.
