Statement on Signing the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2002
Today I have signed into law H.R. 2311, the "Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2002."
I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has gone into producing this Act. The bill abides by the agreed upon aggregate funding level for Fiscal Year 2002 of $686 billion. It provides funding for several important programs with significant national benefits including:
Section 303 of the bill purports to require congressional approval before executive branch execution of aspects of the bill. I will interpret such provisions to require notification only, since any other interpretation would contradict the Supreme Court ruling inINS v. Chadha.Provisions of H.R. 2311 that purport to remove my authority to oversee the activities of the Army Corps of Engineers will be construed consistent with my constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch.
My Administration appreciates that the Congress has worked expeditiously during this difficult and trying time in our Nation's history to consider the FY 2002 appropriations bills. Now, through a renewed sense of bipartisanship, the Congress and the Administration must work together to ensure the timely enactment of the remaining bills.
