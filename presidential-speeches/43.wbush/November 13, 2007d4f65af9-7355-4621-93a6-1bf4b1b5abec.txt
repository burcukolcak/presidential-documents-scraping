Remarks Following a Lunch Meeting With Business and Community Leaders in New Albany, Indiana
Listen, I want to thank you all for joining me. Somebody told me Sam serves good food, and they're right. And it's good to be here in southern Indiana.
I was sitting with business leaders, civic leaders, community activists. I was listening to the concerns of the folks down here. I appreciate the spirit of entrepreneurship that exists. I'm glad people are working. I understand we got to deal with some of the issues, like high gasoline prices.
And it's been a real honor for me to visit with you. It's also good to be with an old family friend, Fuzzy Zoeller, who's been a friend of my family's for a long time. And I forgot that Fuzzy was from these parts and was so thrilled to see him when I walked in here.
But thank you all for your time. Appreciate your consideration, and I love visiting with you. Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 12:20 p.m. at Sam's Tavern. In his remarks, he referred to Sam Anderson, owner, Sam's Tavern; and professional golfer Frank U. "Fuzzy" Zoeller, Jr.
