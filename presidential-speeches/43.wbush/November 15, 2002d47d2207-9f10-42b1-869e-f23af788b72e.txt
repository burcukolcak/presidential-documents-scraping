Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on the Contributions of European Nations and Organizations to the Peacekeeping Operations in Kosovo
Dear__________:
As required by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act, Public Law 106-398, section 1213, I transmit herewith a report on the contributions of European nations and organizations to the peacekeeping operations in Kosovo.
This report, prepared by the Department of State, concludes that the Europeans have carried a significant portion of the aid-sharing burden in the region and that their commitment to reconstruction, humanitarian relief, and institution and peace-building has been a strong one. Continued attention and commitments of assistance from all donors remain crucial for medium-and long-term development in Kosovo.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
