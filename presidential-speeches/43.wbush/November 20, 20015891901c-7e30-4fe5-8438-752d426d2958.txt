Videotaped Remarks for the "Thanks for Giving" Campaign
The President.This year, Thanksgiving will mean more than it ever has before.
The First Lady.So many have given their time, their talent——
The President.——their bravery, their sacrifice, and courage to keep this country strong. Some believe it's astonishing; I believe it's the American character.
The First Lady.As your family gathers, give thanks, and think of all that can be done in your community.
The President.Thanks for making such a difference. Thanks for giving.
God bless you, and God bless America.
NOTE: The President's remarks were videotaped during the afternoon on November 15 at the Bush Ranch in Crawford, TX, for later broadcast. The public service announcement and the script were released on the White House web site on November 20.
