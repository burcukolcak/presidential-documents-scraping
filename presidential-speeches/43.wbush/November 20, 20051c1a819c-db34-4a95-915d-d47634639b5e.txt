Remarks Prior to Discussions With Premier Wen Jiabao of China in Beijing
It's good to see you again, sir. I remember our visit very well. And I thank you for this invitation to come and talk and to have lunch. It will give us a chance to continue to strengthen this very important relationship. And I agree with you; it's a relationship where we've got common interests. We don't agree on every issue, but we do agree we should discuss our differences and our likenesses in a cordial manner.
And so I look forward to this meeting a lot. Thank you for having us.
NOTE: The President spoke at 1:07 p.m. at the Diaoyutai Guest House.
