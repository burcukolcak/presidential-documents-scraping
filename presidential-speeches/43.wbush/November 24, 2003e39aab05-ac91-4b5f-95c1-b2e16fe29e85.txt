Remarks to Reporters in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Medicare Reform Legislation
Because of key votes in the United States Senate today, we're moving closer to Medicare reform, a reform package that will make the system modern, make sure our seniors have prescription drug coverage, better choices. I want to commend the Senate for moving the modernization bill forward. I look forward to them completing their work and getting a bill to my desk that I can sign. Modernizing Medicare will make the system better and will enable us to say to millions of seniors, we've kept our promise to America's seniors.
Thank you all.
