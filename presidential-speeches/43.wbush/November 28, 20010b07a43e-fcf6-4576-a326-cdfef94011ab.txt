Statement on Signing the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002
Today I have signed into law H.R. 2330, the "Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002."
I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has gone into producing this Act. The Act abides by the agreed upon aggregate funding level for Fiscal Year 2002 of $686 billion. It provides for several important programs with significant national benefits by:
A number of provisions contained in the bill purport to restrict executive branch execution of programs that are funded in the bill. Where such provisions contradict the Supreme Court ruling inINS v. Chadha, their intent will be interpreted as advisory only.
I appreciate that the Congress has worked expeditiously during this difficult and trying time in our Nation's history to consider the FY 2002 appropriations bills. Through a renewed sense of bipartisanship, the Congress and my Administration must work together to ensure the timely enactment of the remaining bills.
