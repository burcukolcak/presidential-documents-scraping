Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Legislation To Increase Domestic Refining Capacity
I commend the House for passing legislation that would increase our refining capacity and help address the cost of gasoline, diesel fuels, and jet fuels. No refineries have been built in our Nation since 1976, and the recent disruptions in supply from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have demonstrated that additional refining capacity is critically needed. We must continue to promote sound energy policy to help keep prices down for small businesses and hardworking American families.
