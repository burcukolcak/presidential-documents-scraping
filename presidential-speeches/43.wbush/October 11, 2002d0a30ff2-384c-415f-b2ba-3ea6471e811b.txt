Statement on Senate Action on the Resolution Authorizing the Use of Military Force Against Iraq
With tonight's vote in the United States Senate, America speaks with one voice. The Congress has spoken clearly to the international community and the United Nations Security Council. Saddam Hussein and his outlaw regime pose a grave threat to the region, the world, and the United States. Inaction is not an option; disarmament is a must.
I commend Members of the Senate for the strong bipartisan vote authorizing the use of force if necessary. The Senate, like the House, conducted this important debate and vote in the finest traditions of our democracy.
Our Nation seeks a more just and more peaceful world. Our nation seeks a safer and better world. America will never waver in its commitment to these ideals.
NOTE: The statement referred to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. The Senate received H.J. Res. 114 on October 10 and voted at 12:50 a.m. on October 11.
