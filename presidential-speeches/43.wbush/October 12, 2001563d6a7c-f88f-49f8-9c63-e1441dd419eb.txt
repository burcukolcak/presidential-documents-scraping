Statement on House of Representatives Action on Legislation To Combat Terrorism
I commend the House for passing antiterrorism legislation just one day after the Senate took action. The House and Senate bills are virtually identical. I urge the Congress to quickly get the bill to my desk. We must strengthen the hand of law enforcement to help safeguard America and prevent future attacksâ€”and we must do it now.
