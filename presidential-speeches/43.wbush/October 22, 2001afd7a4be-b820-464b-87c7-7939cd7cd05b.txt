Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Emergency Response Funding To Address Consequences of the September 11 Terrorist Attacks
Dear Mr. Speaker:
In accordance with provisions of Public Law 107-38, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY 2001, today I have authorized transfers from the Emergency Response Fund totaling $1.7 billion for emergency recovery and response and national security activities listed in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. As provided in Public Law 107-38, $1.6 billion of these funds will be made available to agencies 15 days from the date of this transmittal and $71.4 million will be made available to the Department of Defense immediately.
These funds are in addition to the $7.2 billion that I previously authorized for transfer and will allow our Government to continue to address the consequences— both at home and abroad—arising from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
On October 17th, I asked the Congress to provide $20 billion in emergency funding for both defense and domestic needs related to the September attacks. I urge the Congress to enact these crucial resources without delay. The details of these actions are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
