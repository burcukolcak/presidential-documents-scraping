Statement on Apprehension of Suspects in the Washington Area Sniper Attacks
The entire Nation is grateful to all of the local, State, and Federal law enforcement officials who have worked with such great urgency and with so little rest to solve the sniper case. Their efforts resulted in the apprehension of those considered suspects in the sniper shootings. We are also grateful to the citizens who kept their eyes open and provided information to the police. We will keep the victims and their families and friends in our thoughts and prayers. The hunt for a merciless killer has been difficultâ€”and America greatly appreciates all the good men and women who fight crime and uphold justice across this great country.
