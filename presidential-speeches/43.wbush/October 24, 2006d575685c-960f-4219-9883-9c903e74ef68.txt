Statement on the Retirement of Chief Usher Gary Walters
Chief Usher Gary Walters has been a valued public servant to seven First Families for more than three decades at the White House. We have known Gary for many years and are especially grateful for making our family feel at home and for managing and overseeing the operations of the White House, a museum of American history. While we are sad to see him leave, we wish Gary all the best in his future endeavors.
NOTE: This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary as a statement by the President and the First Lady.
