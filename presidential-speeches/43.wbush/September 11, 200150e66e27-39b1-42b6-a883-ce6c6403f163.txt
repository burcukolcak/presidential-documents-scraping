Remarks in Sarasota, Florida, on the Terrorist Attack on New York City's World Trade Center
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America. I, unfortunately, will be going back to Washington after my remarks. Secretary Rod Paige and the Lieutenant Governor will take the podium and discuss education. I do want to thank the folks here at Booker Elementary School for their hospitality.
Today we've had a national tragedy. Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country. I have spoken to the Vice President, to the Governor of New York, to the Director of the FBI and have ordered that the full resources of the Federal Government go to help the victims and their families and to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act.
Terrorism against our Nation will not stand.
And now if you would join me in a moment of silence.
[A moment of silence was observed.]
May God bless the victims, their families, and America.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 9:30 a.m. in the Media Center at Emma Booker Elementary School. In his remarks, the President referred to Lt. Gov. Frank T. Brogan of Florida and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York. At 8:46 a.m. American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center North, and at 9:05 a.m. United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the World Trade Center South. Both flights were scheduled from Boston Logan International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport.
