Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Former President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic in Prague
President Obama.I just want to say very briefly before this brief visit that I was a fan of Mr. Havel's writings even before he ended up leading, or helping to lead the liberation of this extraordinary country. And so for me to be able to spend some time with him and draw inspiration from him is something that I very much appreciate, and it's a great way to cap off my visit not just to the Czech Republic, but also my visit to Europe.
Former President Havel.I'm grateful to the President that he found time in his busy schedule to receive me. And I'm his big admirer, and I'm really glad that we could meet.
President Obama.Thank you, everybody.
Note: The President spoke at 4:47 p.m. at the Prague Congress Center. Audio was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
