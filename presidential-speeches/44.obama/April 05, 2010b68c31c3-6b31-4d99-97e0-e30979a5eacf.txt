Remarks at the White House Easter Egg Roll
How about Amber? Please give Amber a big round of applause.
Is everybody having a good time? Happy Easter, everybody. We are thrilled that all of you could come. I'm not going to make a long speech, because we've got the best speaker, the smartest and best looking of the older Obamas--[Laughter]--and that would be the First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama.
Note: The President spoke at 11:01 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to entertainer Amber Riley, who sang the national anthem. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included the remarks of the First Lady.
