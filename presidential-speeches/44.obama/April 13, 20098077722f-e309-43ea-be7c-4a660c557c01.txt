Remarks at the White House Easter Egg Roll
Hello, everybody. That's Malia, our technical adviser. [Laughter]
It is wonderful to see all of you today. Welcome. I hope everybody had a wonderful Easter. This is one of the greatest White House traditions, because it reminds us that this is the people's house. And to see so many children out here having a great time just fills Michelle and myself and the entire family with a whole lot of joy.
So I'm not really in charge here today. My sole job, in addition to thanking Fergie for that wonderful rendition of our national anthem and thanking my buddy the Easter Bunny for being here, is to introduce my First Lady, your First Lady, Michelle Obama.
Note: The President spoke at 10:25 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to entertainer Stacy "Fergie" Ferguson. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included the remarks of the First Lady.
