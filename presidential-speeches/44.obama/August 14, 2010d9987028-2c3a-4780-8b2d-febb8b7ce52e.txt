Informal Remarks to Reporters in Panama City Beach, Florida
[in clarifying remakrs made at the Iftar Dinner on August 13 regarding plans to build an Islamic cultural center in lower Manhattan]
...Well, my intention was simply to let people know what I thought. Which was that in this country we treat everybody equally and in accordance with the law, regardless of race, regardless of religion. I was not commenting and I will not comment on the wisdom of making the decision to put a mosque there. I was commenting very specifically on the right people have that dates back to our founding. That's what our country is about.
And I think it's very important as difficult as some of these issues are that we stay focused on who we are as a people and what our values are all about.
