Letter to Congressional Leaders on an Alternate Pay Plan for Members of the Uniformed Services
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am transmitting an alternative plan for monthly basic pay increases for members of the uniformed services for 2014.
I am strongly committed to supporting our uniformed service members, who have made such great contributions to our Nation over the past decade of war. As our country continues to recover from serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare, however, we must maintain efforts to keep our Nation on a sustainable fiscal course. This effort requires tough choices, especially in light of budget constraints faced by Federal agencies.
Accordingly, I have determined it is appropriate to exercise my authority under section 1009(e) of title 37, United States Code, to set the 2014 monthly basic pay increase at 1.0 percent. This decision is consistent with my fiscal year 2014 Budget and will not materially affect the Federal Government's ability to attract and retain well-qualified members for the uniformed services.
The adjustments described above shall take effect on the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2014.
Sincerely,
BARACK OBAMA
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to John A. Boehner, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the Senate.
