Statement on the Death of Former National Security Adviser Samuel R. "Sandy" Berger
Sandy Berger was one of our Nation's foremost national security leaders. From his service in President Carter's State Department to President Clinton's National Security Advisor, Sandy devoted himself to strengthening American leadership in an uncertain world. Today, his legacy can be seen in a peaceful Balkans, our strong alliance with Japan, our deeper relationships with India and China. Around the globe, families and children are living healthier, more secure lives because, as a private citizen, Sandy was a humanitarian who helped the world respond to crises and feed the hungry. With his trademark passion, wisdom, and good humor, he is remembered fondly within the ranks of the National Security Council, where those he mentored carry on his work. I'm grateful to Sandy because, as President, I've benefited personally from his advice and counsel. Our thoughts are with Sandy's beloved family, including his wife Susan, his children Deborah, Alexander, and Sarah, and five cherished grandchildren. May they find some comfort in knowing that the America he loved is stronger because of his service.
NOTE: The statement referred to Deborah Berger Fox, Alexander Berger, and Sarah Berger Sandelius, children of former National Security Adviser Berger.
