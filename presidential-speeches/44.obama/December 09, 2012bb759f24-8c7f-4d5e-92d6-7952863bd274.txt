Statement on a Rescue Operation by United States Armed Forces Personnel in Afghanistan
Yesterday our special operators in Afghanistan rescued an American citizen in a mission that was characteristic of the extraordinary courage, skill, and patriotism that our troops show every day. Tragically, we lost one of our special operators in this effort. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family, just as we must always honor our troops and military families. He gave his life for his fellow Americans, and he and his teammates remind us once more of the selfless service that allows our Nation to stay strong, safe, and free.
Note: The statement referred to Dilip Joseph, medical adviser, Morning Star Development, who was kidnapped in eastern Kabul Province, Afghanistan, on December 5; and PO1 Nicolas D. Checque, USN, Naval Special Warfare Development Group, who was killed in the rescue operation.
