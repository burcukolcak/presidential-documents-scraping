Statement on Senator Frank R. Lautenberg's Decision Not To Seek Reelection
Frank is a steadfast champion of the people of New Jersey. Throughout his time in the Senate, Frank has fought tirelessly for workers, veterans, members of our military and their families, and immigrants, and he continues to make extraordinary contributions to our Nation's safety and the health and welfare of our citizens. His service in World War II is a testament to his character and deep commitment to public service. I look forward to working with Frank on critical issues before us these next 2 years, and Michelle and I wish him and Bonnie all the best.
