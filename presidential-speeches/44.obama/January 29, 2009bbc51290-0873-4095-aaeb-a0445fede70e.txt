Statement on Former Governor Rod Blagojevich of Illinois
Today ends a painful episode for Illinois. For months, the State had been crippled by a crisis of leadership. Now that cloud has lifted. I wish Governor Quinn the best and pledge my full cooperation as he undertakes his new responsibilities.
Note: The statement referred to Gov. Patrick J. Quinn of Illinois, who assumed the office of Governor upon former Governor Rod Blagojevich's conviction on Articles of Impeachment by the Illinois State senate.
