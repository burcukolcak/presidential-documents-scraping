Statement on Earned Income Tax Credit Awareness Day
During these difficult economic times, America's working families are struggling to make ends meet and they deserve relief, especially during tax season. The earned-income tax credit gives millions of working families the break they need, and thanks to the Recovery Act, more Americans will qualify for an even larger credit than ever before. The Recovery Act expanded the earned-income tax credit for larger families struggling to get by and cut the marriage penalty that millions of families face. But too many Americans are not aware that they qualify for the credit, so I urge people to visitwww.irs.gov, where you can also learn more about other tax breaks available for working Americans this year.
