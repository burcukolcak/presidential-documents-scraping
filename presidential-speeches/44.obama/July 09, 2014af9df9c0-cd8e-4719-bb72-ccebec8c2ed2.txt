Statement on Senate Confirmation of Julián Castro as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
I applaud the bipartisan majority of Senators who today confirmed Julián Castro as our next Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Julián is a proven leader, a champion for safe, affordable housing and strong, sustainable neighborhoods. I know that together with the dedicated professionals at HUD, Julián will help build on the progress we've made battling back from the great recession: rebuilding our housing market, reducing homelessness among veterans, and connecting neighborhoods with good schools and good jobs that help our citizens succeed. Julián has lived the American Dream in his own life, and I'm confident he will help Americans across our country seize their own piece of that dream for themselves and their children.
