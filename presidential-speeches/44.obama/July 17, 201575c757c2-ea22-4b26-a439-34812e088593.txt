Remarks During a Visit With Women's Army Auxiliary Corps Veteran Emma Didlake
Just very briefly, I want to introduce everybody who have not had a chance to meet her. Ms. Emma Didlake is our oldest living veteran: 110 years old, born in 1905, and served with distinction and honor and received all sorts of commendations for her service during World War II.
We are so grateful that she is here with us today. And it's a great reminder of not only the sacrifices that the greatest generation made on our behalf, but also the kind of trailblazing that our women veterans made, African American veterans who helped to integrate our Armed Services. We are very, very proud of them. That's why we got to make sure we do right by them.
So it's a great honor to have her here.
Thank you, everybody.
NOTE: The President spoke at 1:30 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House.
