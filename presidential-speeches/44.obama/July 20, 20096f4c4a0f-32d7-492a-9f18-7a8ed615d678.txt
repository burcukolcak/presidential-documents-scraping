Statement on a Meeting With Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
I enjoyed my meeting with President Monson and Elder Oaks. I'm grateful for the genealogical records that they brought with them and am looking forward to reading through the materials with my daughters. It's something our family will treasure for years to come.
Note: The statement referred to Thomas S. Monson, president, and Dallin H. Oaks, member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
