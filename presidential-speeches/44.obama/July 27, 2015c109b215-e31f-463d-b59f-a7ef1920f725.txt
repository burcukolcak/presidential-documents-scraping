Remarks Prior to a Meeting on South Sudan and Counterterrorism Issues in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
Well, let me just express my appreciation to the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Prime Minister Hailemariam, as well as all the leaders represented here. They have shown extraordinary leadership in trying to address the continuing situation in South Sudan, and this gives me and the U.S. delegation an opportunity to learn from them what progress has been made, where there appear to be continued roadblocks, and how we can partner with them to make progress.
So I want to thank IGAD for the outstanding work that they're doing, the African Union for their leadership as well. And as a consequence of this discussion, our hope is, is that we can actually bring about the kind of peace that the people of South Sudan so desperately need.
Thank you very much, everybody.
NOTE: The President spoke at 3:37 p.m. at the Sheraton Addis hotel. In his remarks, he referred to the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in Eastern Africa.
