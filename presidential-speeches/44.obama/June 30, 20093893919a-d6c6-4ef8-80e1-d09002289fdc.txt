Statement on Senator-Elect Al Franken's Certification as Winner of the 2008 Minnesota Senatorial Race
I look forward to working with Senator-elect Franken to build a new foundation for growth and prosperity by lowering health care costs and investing in the kind of clean energy jobs and industries that will help America lead in the 21st century.
