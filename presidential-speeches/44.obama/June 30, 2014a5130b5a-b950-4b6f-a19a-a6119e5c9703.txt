Statement on the Deaths of Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar, and Naftali Fraenkel of Israel
On behalf of the American people I extend my deepest and heartfelt condolences to the families of Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar, and Naftali Fraenkelâ€”who held Israeli and American citizenship. As a father, I cannot imagine the indescribable pain that the parents of these teenage boys are experiencing. The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms this senseless act of terror against innocent youth. From the outset, I have offered our full support to Israel and the Palestinian Authority to find the perpetrators of this crime and bring them to justice, and I encourage Israel and the Palestinian Authority to continue working together in that effort. I also urge all parties to refrain from steps that could further destabilize the situation. As the Israeli people deal with this tragedy, they have the full support and friendship of the United States.
NOTE: The statement referred to Ori Yifrach and Iris Yifrach, parents of Eyal Yifrach; Bat Galim Shaar and Ofir Shaar, parents of Gilad Shaar; and Avi Fraenkel and Rachel Fraenkel, parents of Naftali Fraenkel. All three boys were abducted while hitchhiking in the West Bank on June 12. Their bodies were recovered by Israeli authorities on June 30.
