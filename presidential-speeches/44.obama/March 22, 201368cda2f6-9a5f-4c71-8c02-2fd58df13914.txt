Statement on Israel-Turkey Relations
I welcome the call today between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Prime Minister Erdogan. The United States deeply values our close partnerships with both Turkey and Israel, and we attach great importance to the restoration of positive relations between them in order to advance regional peace and security. I am hopeful that today's exchange between the two leaders will enable them to engage in deeper cooperation on this and a range of other challenges and opportunities.
NOTE: The statement referred to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel; and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.
