Statement on the 60th Anniversary of the Supreme Court Decision in Brown v. Board of Education
Tomorrow marks 60 years since the Supreme Court handed down its landmarkBrownv.Board of Educationdecision, the first major step in dismantling the "separate but equal" doctrine that justified Jim Crow. As we commemorate this historic anniversary, we recommit ourselves to the long struggle to stamp out bigotry and racism in all their forms. We reaffirm our belief that all children deserve an education worthy of their promise. And we remember that change did not come overnight, that it took many years and a nationwide movement to fully realize the dream of civil rights for all of God's children. We will never forget the men, women, and children who took extraordinary risks in order to make our country more fair and more free. Today, it falls on us to honor their legacy by taking our place in their march and doing our part to perfect the Union we love.
