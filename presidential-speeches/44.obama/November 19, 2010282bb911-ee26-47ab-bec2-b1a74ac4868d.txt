Statement on the Anniversary of the Birth of the Founder of Sikhism
On Sunday, many around the world will observe the anniversary of birth of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism. I send my best wishes to all those observing this extraordinary occasion. This is also an opportunity to recognize the many contributions that Sikh Americans have made to our Nation and to reflect on the pluralism that is a hallmark of America. Sikhism's principles of equality, service, interfaith cooperation, and respect are principles shared by all Americans. As Sikhs celebrate the birth of Guru Nanak, people of good will everywhere can identify with his teachings on the equality of all humankind and the need for compassion in our service to others.
