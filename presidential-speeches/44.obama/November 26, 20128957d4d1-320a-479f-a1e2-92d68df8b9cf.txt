Statement on the Final Approval of the Settlement in the Cobell Class-Action Lawsuit on Indian Trust Management
I welcome the final approval of the Cobell settlement agreement, clearing the way for reconciliation between the trust beneficiaries and the Federal Government. While Elouise Cobell, the named plaintiff in this case, is no longer with us, her legacy will be a renewed commitment to our trust relationship with Indian Country. I thank her for her honorable work and also want to thank the leaders at the Departments of the Interior, Justice, and Treasury who helped reach this conclusion.
