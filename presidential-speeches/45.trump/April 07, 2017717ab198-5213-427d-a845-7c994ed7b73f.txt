Statement on Senate Confirmation of Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil M. Gorsuch
It is a great honor to announce the historic confirmation of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch as Associate Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States. Judge Gorsuch's confirmation process was one of the most transparent and accessible in history, and his judicial temperament, exceptional intellect, unparalleled integrity, and record of independence makes him the perfect choice to serve on the Nation's highest court. As a deep believer in the rule of law, Judge Gorsuch will serve the American people with distinction as he continues to faithfully and vigorously defend our Constitution.
I would also like to thank Justice Scalia and his wife Maureen for their immeasurable service to this country. Justice Scalia's legacy of fidelity to our laws and our Constitution will never be forgotten.
NOTE: The statement referred to Maureen McCarthy Scalia, wife of the late Associate Justice Antonin G. Scalia. This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary as part of a statement by the Press Secretary titled "President Donald J. Trump Congratulates Judge Neil M. Gorsuch on His Historic Confirmation."
