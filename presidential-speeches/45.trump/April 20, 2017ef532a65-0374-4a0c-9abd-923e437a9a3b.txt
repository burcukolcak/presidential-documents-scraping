Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Implementation of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act
Dear Mr. Chairman:
In accordance with section 1264 of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (Subtitle F, Public Law 114-328)(the "Act") I have enclosed the initial report on its implementation. This report, compiled by the Departments of State, the Treasury, and other relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies), outlines my Administration's support for this important legislation and makes clear our commitment to its robust and thorough enforcement.
As noted in the report, my Administration is actively identifying persons and entities to whom the Act may apply and are collecting the evidence necessary to apply it. Over the coming weeks and months, agencies will undertake thorough interagency vetting to ensure we fulfill our commitment to hold perpetrators of human rights abuses and corruption accountable.
As we implement this legislation, the United States will continue its leadership role in championing fundamental human rights and sound, transparent governance.
Sincerely,

DONALD J. TRUMP
