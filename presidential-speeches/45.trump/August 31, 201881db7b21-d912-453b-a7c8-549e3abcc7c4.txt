Letter to Congressional Leaders on Intention To Enter Into a Trade Agreement
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
On May 18, 2017, my Administration notified the Congress that I intended to initiate trade negotiations with Canada and Mexico. Negotiations began on August 16, 2017. Since that time, my Administration has worked hard with Mexico and Canada to reach a modern trade agreement that sets high standards for free, fair, and reciprocal trade.
I am pleased to report that in only 1 year, we have made dramatic progress toward such an agreement:

In short, this agreement is a great deal for the American people. It sets a new tone for all trade agreements, proof of the high standard that my Administration will require of any country entering a new trade agreement with the United States.
I intend to enter into the agreement by the end of November 2018. Accordingly, pursuant to section 106(a)(1)(A) of the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-26, Title I), I hereby notify the House of Representatives and the Senate that I intend to enter into a trade agreement with Mexicoâ€”and with Canada if it is willing, in a timely manner, to meet the high standards for free, fair, and reciprocal trade contained therein. My Administration looks forward to continued collaboration with the Congress to develop legislation to approve and implement this agreement.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to Paul D. Ryan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Michael R. Pence, President of the Senate.
