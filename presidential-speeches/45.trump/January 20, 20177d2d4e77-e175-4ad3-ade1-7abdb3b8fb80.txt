Statement on Senate Confirmation of James N. Mattis as Secretary of Defense and John F. Kelly as Secretary of Homeland Security
I am pleased by the confirmation votes of Generals Mattis and Kelly. These uniquely qualified leaders will immediately begin the important work of rebuilding our military, defending our Nation, and securing our borders. I am proud to have these two American heroes join my administration.
I call on Members of the Senate to fulfill their constitutional obligation and swiftly confirm the remainder of my highly qualified Cabinet nominees so that we can get to work on behalf of the American people without further delay.
