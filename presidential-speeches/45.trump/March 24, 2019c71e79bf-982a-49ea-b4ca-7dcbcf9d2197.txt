Remarks to Reporters on the Conclusion of Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III's Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election in Palm Beach, Florida
So, after a long look, after a long investigation, after so many people have been so badly hurt, after not looking at the other side where a lot of bad things happened, a lot of horrible things happened, a lot of very bad things happened for our country, it was just announced there was no collusion with Russia, the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
There was no collusion with Russia. There was no obstruction and none whatsoever. And it was a complete and total exoneration. It's a shame that our country had to go through this. To be honest, it's a shame that your President has had to go through this forâ€”before I even got elected, it began. And it began illegally. And hopefully, somebody is going to look at the other side. This was an illegal takedown that failed. And hopefully, somebody is going to be looking at the other side.
So it's complete exoneration. No collusion. No obstruction.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 4:46 p.m. on the tarmac at Palm Beach International Airport prior to boarding Air Force One, en route to Washington, DC.
