Statement on the Nomination of Physician to the President and Chief White House Physician Ronny L. Jackson To Be Secretary of Veterans Affairs
I am proud to nominate Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson M.D. as Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Admiral Jackson is highly trained and qualified and as a servicemember himself, he has seen firsthand the tremendous sacrifice our veterans make and has a deep appreciation for the debt our great country owes them.
The Honorable Robert Wilkie will serve as the Acting Secretary for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Mr. Wilkie is currently the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness at the Department of Defense and overseas health affairs, welfare and quality of life for military families.
I appreciate the work of Dr. David Shulkin and the many great things we did together at Veterans Affairs, including the VA Accountability Act that he was helpful in getting passed. He has been a great supporter of veterans across the country, and I am grateful for his service.
