Letter to Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James B. Comey, Jr., Informing Him of His Termination and Removal From Office
Dear Director Comey:
I have received the attached letters from the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General of the United States recommending your dismissal as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately.
While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.
It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.
I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.

DONALD J. TRUMP
The White House,

Sessions III recommending Director Comey's removal from office and a memorandum for Attorney General Sessions from Deputy Attorney General Rod J.
