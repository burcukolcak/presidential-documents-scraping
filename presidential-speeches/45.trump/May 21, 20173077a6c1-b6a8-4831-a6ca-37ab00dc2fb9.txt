Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Amir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
President Trump. Thank you very much, everybody. We have some wonderful meetings going on over the last 2 days. We are friends. We've been friends now for a long time, indirectly, haven't we?
Amir Tamim.Yes, we are.
President Trump.And our relationship is extremely good. We have some very serious discussions right now going on. And one of the things that we will discuss is the purchase of lots of beautiful military equipment, because nobody makes it like the United States. And for us, that means jobs. And it also means, frankly, great security back here, which we want.
So it's an honor to be with you, and thank you very much.
Amir Tamim.Thank you very much. Thank you.
President Trump.Okay, thank you, everybody.
