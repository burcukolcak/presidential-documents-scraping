Remarks at a Meeting With Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc of Vietnam
President Trump.Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have Prime Minister Phuc with us from Vietnam, and we are already in discussions as to some very major topics, including trade. We have a major trade deficit with Vietnam which will, hopefully, balance out in the short period of time. We expect to be able to do that. They've just made a very large order in the United States—and we appreciate that—for many billions of dollars, which means jobs for the United States and great, great equipment for Vietnam.
And I just want to thank you very much for you and all of your representatives to be with us today. Thank you very much.
[At this point, Prime Minister Phuc made brief remarks in Vietnamese, and no translation was provided. President Trump then spoke as follows.]
President Trump.Thank you very much. Thank you very much, everybody.
NOTE: The President spoke at 3:26 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House. The transcript, prepared for immediate release by the Office of the Press Secretary, was received by the Office of the Federal Register on July 27.
