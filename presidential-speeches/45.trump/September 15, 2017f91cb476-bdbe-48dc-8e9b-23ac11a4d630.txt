Remarks on the Terrorist Attack in London, United Kingdom, in an Exchange With Reporters
Q.Mr. President, any reaction to London, the terror attack?
The President.No, it's a terrible thing, just keeps going and going. And we have to be very smart; we have to be very, very tough, which perhaps we're not nearly tough enough. But that is just an absolutely terrible thing. In fact, I'm going to call the Prime Minister right now.
Q.Have you been briefed on any intelligence about the attack?
The President.Yes, I have, on numerous things happening, including North Korea.
Q. [Inaudible]—on the London attack——
The President. So I've been briefed, and I'm going in right now for the briefing. And I'm going to see Frank inside too.
Q.What did you mean when you said that the Muslim ban had to be more specific?
The President.We have to be tougher, and we have to be smarter. Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at approximately 9:40 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom; and Frank X. Giaccio, an 11-year-old Falls Church, VA, resident who was granted permission to mow the White House lawn.
