The President's Virtual Meeting With U.S. Governors
Q.What did the Governors tell you they're worried about?
The President.Well, they're not—they didn't tell me they're worried, but they thanked me for the cooperation they're getting. They said they've gotten all that they need. They just want to know what we think is going to happen from here.
They asked Dr. Fauci some more questions about everything from whether or not he thought he was going to move to test at home—I mean, on air flights and that kind of thing.
But there was no—there were no complaints. There was a lot of cooperation.
NOTE: The President spoke at 12:20 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White House prior to boarding Marine One. In his remarks, he referred to National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci, in his capacity as White House Chief Medical Adviser.
