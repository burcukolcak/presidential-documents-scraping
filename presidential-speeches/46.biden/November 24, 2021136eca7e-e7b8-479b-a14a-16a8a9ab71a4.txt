Statement on Ukrainian Holodomor Remembrance Day
Each November, we solemnly honor and pay tribute to the millions of innocent Ukrainians who suffered and perished during theHolodomor—"death by hunger"—in 1932 and 1933. The men, women, and children who lost their lives during this famine were victims of the brutal policies and deliberate acts of the regime of Joseph Stalin. This month, as we commemorate those whose lives were taken, let us also recommit ourselves to the constant work of preventing such tragedies in the future and lifting up those who are suffering under the yoke of tyranny today.
The Ukrainian people overcame the horror of theHolodomor, demonstrating their spirit and resilience, and eventually creating a free and democratic society. As we remember the pain and the victims of theHolodomor, the United States also reaffirms our commitment to the people of Ukraine today and our unwavering support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
