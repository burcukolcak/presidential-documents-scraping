Statement on the Verdict in the Ahmaud Arbery Murder Trial in Brunswick, Georgia
Ahmaud Arbery's killing—witnessed by the world on video—is a devastating reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for racial justice in this country. Mr. Arbery should be here today, celebrating the holidays with his mother Wanda Cooper-Jones and his father Marcus Arbery. Nothing can bring Mr. Arbery back to his family and to his community, but the verdict ensures that those who committed this horrible crime will be punished.
While the guilty verdicts reflect our justice system doing its job, that alone is not enough. Instead, we must recommit ourselves to building a future of unity and shared strength, where no one fears violence because of the color of their skin. My administration will continue to do the hard work to ensure that equal justice under law is not just a phrase emblazoned in stone above the Supreme Court, but a reality for all Americans.
NOTE: The statement referred to Travis McMichael, his father Gregory McMichael, and their neighbor William "Roddie" Bryan, who were convicted in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery in Glynn County, GA, on February 23, 2020.
