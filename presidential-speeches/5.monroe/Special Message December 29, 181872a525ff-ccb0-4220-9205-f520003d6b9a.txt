James Monroe
December 29, 1818

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I lay before the Senate, for their consideration, a convention, signed at London on the 20th of October last, between the United States and Great Britain, together with the documents showing the course and progress of the negotiation. I have to request that these documents, which are original, may be returned when the Senate shall have acted on the convention.
JAMES MONROE.
