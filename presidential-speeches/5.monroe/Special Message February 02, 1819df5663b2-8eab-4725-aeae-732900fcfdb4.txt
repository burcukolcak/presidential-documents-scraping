Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
In compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 13th of last month, requesting me "to cause to be laid before it a statement showing the measures that have been taken to collect the balances stated to be due from the several supervisors and collectors of the old direct tax of two millions; also a similar statement of the balances due from the officers of the old internal revenue, and to designate in such statement the persons who have been interested in the collection of the said debts and the sums by them respectively collected, and the time when the same were collected," I transmit a report of the Secretary of the Treasury, which, with the documents accompanying it, contains all the information required.
JAMES MONROE.
