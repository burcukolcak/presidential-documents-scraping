Special Message
To the House of Representatives:
In compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives "requesting the President of the United States to cause to be laid before this House any information which he may have of the condition of the several Indian tribes within the United States and the measures hitherto devised and pursued for their civilization," I now transmit a report from the Secretary of War.
JAMES MONROE.
