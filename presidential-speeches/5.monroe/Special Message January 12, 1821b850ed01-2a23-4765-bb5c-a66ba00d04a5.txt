James Monroe
January 12, 1821

Special Message
To the House of Representatives of the United States:
I transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the Secretary of State, with the inclosed documents, relating to the negotiation for the suppression of the slave trade, which should have accompanied a message on that subject communicated to the House some time since, but which were accidentally omitted.
JAMES MONROE.
