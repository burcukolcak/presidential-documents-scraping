Special Message
To the House of Representatives of the United States:
I communicate to the House of Representatives a report from the Secretary of State, with a copy of the three articles* (marked A) requested by the resolution of the House of the 19th instant. The third of those articles relating to a subject upon which the negotiation between the two Governments is yet open, the communication of all the other documents relating to it is reserved to a future period, when it may be closed.
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.
