Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I beg leave to call the attention of Congress to the accompanying communication from the Secretary of State, inclosing a correspondence between him and the artist employed to execute the statue of Washington which is to be placed in the Rotunda of the Capitol.
It appears form this correspondence that the present appropriation for the execution of this work is inadequate to the object, and I therefore fell it my duty before concluding the contract to ascertain whether the additional sum recommended as proper by the Secretary of State and the terms proposed by the artist will meet the approbation of Congress.
For this purpose the papers are respectfully submitted.
ANDREW JACKSON
