Andrew Jackson
February 14, 1835

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States.
I beg leave to call the attention of Congress to the accompanying communication from the Secretary of War, from which it appears that the "act for the relief of Benedict Alford and Robert Brush," although signed and duly certified by the proper officers as having passed the two Houses of Congress at their last session, had not in fact obtained the sanction of that body when it was presented to the President for his approval.
Under these circumstances it is thought that the subject is worthy of the consideration of Congress.
ANDREW JACKSON
