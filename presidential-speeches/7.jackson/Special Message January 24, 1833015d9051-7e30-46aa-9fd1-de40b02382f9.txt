Special Message
To the House of Representatives:
I send herewith a convention concluded on the 14th day of October last between the United States and His Majesty the King of the Two Siciles. This treaty has been ratified by me agreeably to the Constitution, and the ratification will be dispatched to Naples without delay, when there is no doubt it will be ratified by His Sicilian Majesty.
The early communication of this treaty is deemed proper because it will be necessary to provide for the execution of the first article in order that our fellow-citizens may with as little delay as possible obtain the compensation stipulated for by this convention.
ANDREW JACKSON
