Special Message
To the Senate of the United States.
GENTLEMEN: In compliance with your resolution of the 4th ultimo, relating to the boundary line between the United States and the Cherokee Nation of Indians, I have duly examined the same, and find that the Executive has no power to alter or correct it.
I therefore return the papers, with a report from the Secretary of War on the subject, for the further deliberation of Congress.
ANDREW JACKSON
