Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate:
The treaty of commerce and navigation concluded at Washington on the 1st of May, 1828, between the United States and the King of Prussia, was laid before the Senate, who, by their resolution of the 14th of that month, advised and consented to its ratification by the President.
By the sixteenth article of that treaty it was agreed that the exchange of ratifications should be made within nine months from its date.
On the 15th day of February last, being fifteen days after the time stipulated for the exchange by the terms of the treaty, the charge d'affaires of the King of Prussia informed the Secretary of State that he had received the Prussian ratification and was ready to exchange it for that of the United States. In reply he was informed of the intention of the President, my late predecessor, not to proceed to the exchange in consequence of the expiration of the time within which it was to be made.
Under these circumstances I have thought it my duty, in order to avoid all future questions, to ask the advice and consent of the Senate to make the proposed exchange.
I send you the original of the treaty, together with a printed copy of it.
ANDREW JACKSON
