Andrew Jackson

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives.
Believing that the act of the 12th July, 1832, does not enable the Executive to carry into effect the recently negotiated additional article to the treaty of limits with Mexico, I transmit to Congress copies of that article, that the necessary legislative provision may be made for its faithful execution on the part of the United States.
ANDREW JACKSON
MAY 6, 1836.
