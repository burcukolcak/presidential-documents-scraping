Special Message
To the Senate of the United States.
GENTLEMEN: For the reasons expressed in the inclosed note, I renominate Wharton Rector to be agent for the Shawnee and Delaware Indians.
ANDREW JACKSON
The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
SIR: The rejection of Colonel Rector by the Senate took place in the absence of Mr. McLean and myself. We were both confined to our rooms by illness. Had we been present his nomination would have been confirmed. I believe that if he were again placed before the Senate his nomination would be confirmed, and should therefore be pleased if he could be again nominated.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
J. ROWAN.
