Martin van Buren
April 18, 1838

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States.
I return the petition and papers of Econchatta Nico,++ referred to me by a resolution of the Senate of February 7, 1837, and transmit a communication and accompanying papers from the Acting Secretary of War, showing the failure of the attempt made, in conformity with the resolution, to obtain indemnity for the petitioner by prosecuting the depredators on his property, and also the causes of the failure. The papers are returned and the report and documents of the Acting Secretary of War submitted in order that Congress may devise such other mode of relief as may seem proper.
M. VAN BUREN.
++ A chief of the Apalachicola Indians, for indemnification for losses sustained by depredations on his property by white persons.
