Special Message
To the House of Representatives of the United States:
I transmit the accompanying documents, marked from 1 to 5,* in reply to a resolution of yesterday's date, calling for copies of correspondence between the Executive of the General Government and the governor of Pennsylvania in relation to "a call of the latter for an armed force of United States troops since the present session of Congress," and requiring information "whether any officer of the United States instigated or participated" in the riotous proceedings referred to in the resolution, and "what measures, if any, the President has taken to investigate and punish the said acts, and whether any such officer still remains in the service of the United States."
M. VAN BUREN.
* Relating to the "Buckshot war,"
