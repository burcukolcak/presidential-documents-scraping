Special Message
To the House of Representatives:
An important difference of opinion having arisen concerning the construction of an act of Congress making a grant of land to the State of Indiana,+ and in which she feels a deep interest, I deem it proper to submit all the material facts to your consideration, with a view to procure such additional legislation as the facts of the case may appear to render proper.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury and the documents annexed from the General Land Office will disclose all the circumstances deemed material in relation to the subject, and are herewith presented.
M. VAN BUREN.
