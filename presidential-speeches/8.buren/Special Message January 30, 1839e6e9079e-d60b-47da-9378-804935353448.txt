Martin van Buren
January 30, 1839

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of the Treasury, on the subject of commissions claimed by agents or officers employed by the General Government.
The propriety of new legislation regulating the whole matter by express laws seems very apparent, and is urgently recommended to the early attention of Congress.
M. VAN BUREN.
