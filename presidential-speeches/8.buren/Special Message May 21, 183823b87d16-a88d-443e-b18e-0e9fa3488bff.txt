Martin van Buren
May 21, 1838

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
The accompanying copy of a communication addressed by the Secretary of War to the Cherokee delegation is submitted to Congress in order that such measures may be adopted as are required to carry into effect the benevolent intentions of the Government toward the Cherokee Nation, and which it is hoped will induce them to remove peaceably and contentedly to their new homes in the West.
M. VAN BUREN.
