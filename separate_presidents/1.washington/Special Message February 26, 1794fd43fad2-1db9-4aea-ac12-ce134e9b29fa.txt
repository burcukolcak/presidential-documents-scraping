George Washington
February 26, 1794

Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate:
I have caused the correspondence which is the subject of your resolution of the 24th day of January last to be laid before me. After an examination of it I directed copies and translations to be made, except in those particulars which, in my judgment, for public considerations, ought not to be communicated.
These copies and translations are now transmitted to the Senate; but the nature of them manifests the propriety of their being received as confidential.
GO. WASHINGTON.
