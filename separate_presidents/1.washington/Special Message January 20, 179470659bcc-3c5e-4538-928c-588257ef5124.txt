George Washington
January 20, 1794

Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
Having already laid before you a letter of the 16th of August, 1793, from the Secretary of State to our minister at Paris, stating the conduct and urging the recall of the minister plenipotentiary of the Republic of France, I now communicate to you that his conduct has been unequivocally disapproved, and that the strongest assurances have been given that his recall should be expedited without delay.
GO. WASHINGTON.
