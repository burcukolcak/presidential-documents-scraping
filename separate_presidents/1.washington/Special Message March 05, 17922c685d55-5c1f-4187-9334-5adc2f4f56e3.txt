Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
Knowing the friendly interest you take in whatever may promote the happiness and prosperity of the French nation, it is with pleasure that I lay before you the translation of a letter which I have received from His Most Christian Majesty, announcing to the United States of America his acceptance of the constitution presented to him by his nation.
GO. WASHINGTON.
Very Dear Great Friends and Allies:
We make it our duty to inform you that we have accepted the constitution which has been presented to us in the name of the nation, and according to which France will be henceforth governed.
We do not doubt that you take an interest in an event so important to our Kingdom and to us, and it is with real pleasure we take this occasion to renew to you assurances of the sincere friendship we bear you. Where upon we pray God to have you, very dear great friends and allies, in His just and holy keeping.
Written at Paris the 19th of September, 1791.
Your good friend and ally,
LOUIS.
MONTMORIN.
The UNITED STATES OF NORTH AMERICA.
