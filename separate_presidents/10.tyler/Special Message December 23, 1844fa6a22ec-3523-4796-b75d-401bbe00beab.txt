December 23, 1844

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
The messenger who lately bore to Berlin the ratified copy of the convention for the mutual abolition of thedroitd'aubaineand taxes on emigration between the United States of America and the Grand Duchy of Hesse, has just returned to Washington, bearing with him the exchange copy of said convention. It appears that the exchange of ratifications did not take place until the 16th day of October, twenty days after the period fixed by the convention itself for that purpose. This informality, which it would seem was occasioned by the absence from Berlin of the plenipotentiary from Hesse and by the time necessarily required for the preparation of the document, has been waived by the representative of that Government.
This subject is now submitted for the consideration of the Senate.
JOHN TYLER.
