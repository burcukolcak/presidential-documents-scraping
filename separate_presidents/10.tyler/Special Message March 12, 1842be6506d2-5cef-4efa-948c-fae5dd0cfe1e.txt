Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I have reason to think that the rejection of Silas Reed as surveyor-general of Illinois and Missouri on the evening of the last day of the session of the Senate at the last session of Congress was rounded in a misapprehension of facts, which, while it deprived the public of the services of a useful officer, left him to suffer a considerable degree of injustice in his reputation. After mature reflection upon all the circumstances of his case, and particularly of facts which have become known since his rejection, I have felt it my duty to submit his nomination for the same office anew to the Senate for its advice and consent.
I therefore nominate Silas Reed to be surveyor-general of Illinois and Missouri, in place of Joseph C. grown, removed.
JOHN TYLER.
