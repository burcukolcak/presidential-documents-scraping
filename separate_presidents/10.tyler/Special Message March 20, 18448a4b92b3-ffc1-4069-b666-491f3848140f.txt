Special Message
To the House of Representatives.
I transmit herewith to the House of Representatives a copy of the convention concluded on the 17th day of March, 1841 between the United States and the Republic of Peru, which has been duly ratified and of which the ratifications have been exchanged.
The communication of this treaty is now made to the end that suitable measures may be adopted to give effect to the first article thereof, which provides for the distribution among the claimants of the sum of $300,000, thereby stipulated to be paid.
JOHN TYLER.
