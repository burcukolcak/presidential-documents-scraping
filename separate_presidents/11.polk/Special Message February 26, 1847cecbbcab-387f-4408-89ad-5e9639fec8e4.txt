Special Message
To the Senate of the United States.
I nominate the officers named in the accompanying list * for brevet promotion in the Army of the United States, for gallant conduct in the actions at Monterey.
JAMES K. POLK.
*Omitted.
WAR DEPARTMENT,February 19, 1847.
The PRESIDENT.
SIR: I present to you the following list* of officers engaged in the actions at Monterey, whose distinguished conduct therein entitles them, in my judgment, to the promotion by brevet. This list has been prepared after a particular and careful examination of all the documents in this Department in relation to the military operations at that place.
* Omitted.
Lieutenant-Colonel Garland and Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Childs (then a captain of the line) also behaved in the actions of Monterey in a manner deserving of particular notice, but as their names are now before the Senate for colonelcies by brevet, I have not presented them for further promotion. I am not aware that any officer below the lineal rank of colonel has ever been made a brigadier-general by brevet.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. L. MARCY.
