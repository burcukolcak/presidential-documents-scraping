Proclamation—Day of Fasting, Humilia­tion, and Prayer
By the President of the United States of America
A Recommendation
At a season when the providence of God has manifested itself in the visitation of a fearful pestilence, which is spreading itself throughout the land, it is fitting that a people, whose reliance has ever been in his protection, should humble themselves before his throne; and, while acknowledging past transgressions, ask a continuance of the Divine mercy.
It is, therefore, earnestly recommended that the first Friday in August be observed throughout the United States as a day ofFasting,Humiliation, andPrayer. All business will be suspended in the various branches of the public service on that day; and it is recommended to persons of all religious denominations to abstain, as far as practicable, from secular occupations, and to assemble in their respective places of Public Worship, to acknowledge the infinite goodness which has watched over our existence as a nation, and so long crowned us with manifold blessings; and to implore the Almighty, in his own good time, to stay the destroying hand now lifted against us.
Z. Taylor.
