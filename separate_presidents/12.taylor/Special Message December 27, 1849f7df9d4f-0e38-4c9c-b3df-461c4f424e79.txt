Zachary Taylor
December 27, 1849

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
In consequence of the unexpected delay in proceeding to business, I deem it necessary to invite the immediate attention of Congress to so much of the report of the Secretary of the Treasury as relates to the appropriations required for the expenses of collecting the revenue for the second half of the current fiscal year.
Z. TAYLOR.
