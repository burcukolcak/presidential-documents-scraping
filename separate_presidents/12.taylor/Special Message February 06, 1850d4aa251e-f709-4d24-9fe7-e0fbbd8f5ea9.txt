Zachary Taylor
February 06, 1850

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
In reply to the resolution of the Senate of the 28th ultimo, I have to state that the resolution of the Senate of the 2d of March, 1849, respecting James W. Schaumburg, was in April of that year submitted for the opinion of the Attorney-General upon questions arising in the case. No opinion had been given by him when it became necessary, prior to the meeting of the Senate, to prepare the nominations for promotions in the Army. The nomination of Lieutenant Ewell was then decided upon, after due consideration was given to the resolution of the Senate of the 2d of March, 1849.
I herewith submit a report from the Secretary of War, showing the grounds upon which the decision above referred to was made.
Z. TAYLOR.
