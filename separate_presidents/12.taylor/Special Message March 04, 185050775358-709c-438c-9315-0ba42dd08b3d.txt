Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I herewith transmit to Congress copies of a recent correspondence between the Department of State and the British minister at Washington, relating to subjects* which seem to require the consideration of the legislative rather than the executive branch of the Government.
Z. TAYLOR.
* Navigation laws and tariff on British productions.
