Communication to the Senate From Mr. Fillmore
To the Senate of the United States:
In consequence of the lamented death of Zachary Taylor, late President of the United States, I shall no longer occupy the chair of the Senate, and I have thought that a formal communication to the Senate to that effect, through your Secretary, might enable you the more promptly to proceed to the choice of a presiding officer.
MILLARD FILLMORE.
