Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
In answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 23d ultimo, requesting information in regard to the fisheries on the coasts of the British possessions in North America, I transmit a report from the Acting Secretary of State and the documents by which it was accompanied. Commodore M. C. Perry, with the United States steam frigateMississippiunder his command, has been dispatched to that quarter for the purpose of protecting the rights of American fishermen under the convention of 1818.
