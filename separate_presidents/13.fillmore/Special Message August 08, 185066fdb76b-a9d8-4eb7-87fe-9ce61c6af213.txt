Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
It has been suggested that the language in the first paragraph of my message to the two Houses of Congress of the 6th instant may convey the idea that Governor Bell's letter to my predecessor was received by him before his death. It was addressed to him, but appears, in point of fact, to have been sent to me from the post-office after his death.
I make this communication to accompany the message and prevent misapprehension.
MILLARD FILLMORE.
