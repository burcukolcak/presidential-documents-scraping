Millard Fillmore
August 13, 1852

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit a report from the Secretary of State upon the subject of the relations between the United States and the Republics of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, in Central America, which has been delayed longer than I desired in consequence of the ill health of the Secretary of State.
MILLARD FILLMORE.
