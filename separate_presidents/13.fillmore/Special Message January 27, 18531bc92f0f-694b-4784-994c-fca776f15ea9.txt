Special Message
To the House of Representatives:
Since my last message to your honorable body, communicating a report from the Treasury Department, in answer to your resolution of the 3d instant (27th ultimo?), in reference to the compensation of weighers and gaugers, further communications on that subject have been received from New Orleans, which have just been reported to me by the Secretary of the Treasury and which I deem it my duty to communicate to the House.
MILLARD FILLMORE.
