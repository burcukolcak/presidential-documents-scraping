Millard Fillmore
September 23, 1850

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
Having been informed that it is the wish of the family and relatives of the late lamented President of the United States that his remains should be removed to the State of Kentucky, and being desirous of manifesting the most sincere and profound respect for the character of the deceased, in which I doubt not Congress will fully concur, I have felt it to be my duty to make known to you the wishes of the family, that you might previous to your adjournment adopt such proceedings and take such order on the subject as in your wisdom may seem meet and proper on the occasion.
MILLARD FILLMORE.
(The remains of the late President of the United States were removed from Washington to Louisville, Ky., October 25, 1850.)
