Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith the report of the Secretary of State in reply to the resolution of the Senate of the 27th ultimo.
That part of the document which purports to recite my official instructions is strictly correct; that which is avowedly unofficial and unauthorized, it can hardly be necessary for the to say, in view of the documents already before the Senate, does not convey a correct impression of my "views and wishes."
At no time after an intention was entertained of sending Mr. Ward as special agent to Mexico was either the Garay grant or the convention entered into by Mr. Conkling alluded to otherwise than as subjects which might embarrass the negotiation of the treaty, and were consequently not included in the instructions.
While the departure of Mr. Ward, under any circumstances or in any respect, from the instructions committed to him is a matter of regret, it is just to say that, although he failed to convey in his letter to General Gadsden the correct import of remarks made by me anterior to his appointment as special agent, I impute to him no design of misrepresentation.
FRANKLIN PIERCE.
