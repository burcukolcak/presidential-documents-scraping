Franklin Pierce
July 22, 1854

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I have this day given my signature to the "Act making further appropriations for the improvement of the Cape Fear River, in North Carolina."
The occasion seems to render it proper for me to deviate from the ordinary course of announcing the approval of bills by an oral statement only, and, for the purpose of preventing any misapprehension which might otherwise arise from the phraseology of this act, to communicate in writing that any approval is given to it on the ground that the obstructions which the proposed appropriation is intended to remove are the result of acts of the General Government.
FRANKLIN PIERCE.
