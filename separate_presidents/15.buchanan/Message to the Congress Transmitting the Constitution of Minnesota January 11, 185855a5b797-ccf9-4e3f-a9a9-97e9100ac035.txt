Message to the Congress Transmitting the Constitution of Minnesota
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I have received from Samuel Medary, governor of the Territory of Minnesota, a copy of the constitution of Minnesota, "together with an abstract of the votes polled for and against said constitution" at the election held in that Territory on the second Tuesday of October last, certified by the governor in due form, which I now lay before Congress in the manner prescribed by that instrument.
Having received but a single copy of the constitution, I transmit this to the Senate.
JAMES BUCHANAN.
