Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit a copy of the convention between the United States and the Republic of Paraguay, concluded on the 4th February, 1859, and proclaimed on the 12th instant, and invite the attention of Congress to the expediency of such legislation as may be deemed necessary to carry into effect the stipulations of the convention relative to the organization of the commission provided for therein.
The commissioner on the part of Paraguay is now in this city, and is prepared to enter upon the duties devolved upon the joint commission.
JAMES BUCHANAN.
