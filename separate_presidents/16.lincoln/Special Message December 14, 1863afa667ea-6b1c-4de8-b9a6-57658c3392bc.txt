Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I lay before the Senate, for its constitutional action thereon, a treaty concluded at the city of Washington on the 6th day of April, 1863, between John P. Usher, commissioner on the part of the United States, and the chiefs and headmen of the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache tribes of Indians, duly authorized thereto.
A letter of the Secretary of the Interior of the 12th instant accompanies the treaty.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
