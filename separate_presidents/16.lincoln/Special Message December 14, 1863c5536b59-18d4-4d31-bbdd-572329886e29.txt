Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I lay before the Senate, for its constitutional action thereon, a treaty concluded at Le Roy, Kans., on the 29th day of August, 1863, between William P. Dole. Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and William G. Coffin, superintendent of Indian affairs of the southern superintendency, commissioners on the part of the United States, and the chiefs and headmen of the Great and Little Osage tribe of Indians of the State of Kansas.
A communication from the Secretary, of the Interior, dated the 12th instant, accompanies the treaty.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
