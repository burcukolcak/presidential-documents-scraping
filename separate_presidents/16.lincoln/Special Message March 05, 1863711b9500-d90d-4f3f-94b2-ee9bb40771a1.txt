To the Senate of the United States:
For the reasons stated by the Secretary of War, I present the nomination of the persons named in the accompanying communication for confirmation of the rank of major-general, in which capacity they were acting at the time they fell in battle,
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
WAR DEPARTMENT,
Washington, March 5, 1863.
The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
SIR: The following-named persons having fallen in battle while performing the duty and exercising command as major-generals, a rank which they had earned in the service of their country, I have the honor to propose that their names be submitted to the Senate for confirmation, as a token of the Government' s appreciation of their distinguished merit. This is in accordance with the practice in similar cases, Brevet nominations and confirmations having been made after the decease of gallant officers.
To be major-general of volunteers.

I am, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,
EDWIN M. STANTON,
