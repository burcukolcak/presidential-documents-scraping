Executive Order
Whereas circumstances of recent occurrence have made it no longer necessary to continue the prohibition of the departure for her destination of the gunboatFusyama, built at New York for the Japanese Government, it is consequently ordered that that prohibition be removed. The Secretary of the Treasury will therefore cause a clearance to be issued to theFusyama, and the Secretary of the Navy will not allow any obstacle thereto.
ANDREW JOHNSON.
