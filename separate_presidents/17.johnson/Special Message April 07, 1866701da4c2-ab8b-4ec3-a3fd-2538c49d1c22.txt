Andrew Johnson
April 07, 1866

Special Message
To the House of Representatives of the United States:
I transmit a communication from the Secretary of the Interior, with the accompanying papers, in reference to grants of land made by acts of Congress passed in the years 1850, 1853, and 1856 to the States of Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida. and Louisiana, to aid in the construction of certain railroads. As these acts will expire by limitation on the 11th day of August, 1866; leaving the roads for whose benefit they were conferred in an unfinished condition, it is recommended that the time within which they may be completed be extended for a period of five years.
ANDREW JOHNSON.
