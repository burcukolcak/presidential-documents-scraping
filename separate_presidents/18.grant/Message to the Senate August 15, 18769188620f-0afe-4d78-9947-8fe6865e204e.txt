Ulysses S. Grant
August 15, 1876

Message to the Senate
To the Senate of the United States:
Upon further investigation I am convinced that my message of this date, withholding my signature from Senate bill No. 779, entitled "An act to provide for the sale of a portion of the reservation of the confederated Otoe and Missouria and the Sacs and Foxes of the Missouri tribes of Indians, in the States of Kansas and Nebraska," was premature, and I request, therefore, that the bill may be returned, in order that I may affix my signature to it.
U.S. GRANT.
(A motion to refer the last message to the Committee on Privileges and Elections was, after debate, determined in the negative; and the question recurring, Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding? it was determined in the affirmative--yeas 36, nays 0.)
