Ulysses S. Grant
January 12, 1877

Message to the Senate
To the Senate of the United States:
On the eve of the adjournment of the last session of Congress I returned to the Senate bill No. 561, entitled "An act for the relief of Major Junius T. Turner," with my objections to its becoming a law. I now desire to withdraw those objections, as I am satisfied they were made under a misapprehension of the facts.
U. S. GRANT.
Note: This message was also referred to the Committee on Military Affairs. which committee, on February 13, 1877, reported to the Senate a recommendation that the bill do pass, the objections of the President of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding. No action was taken.
