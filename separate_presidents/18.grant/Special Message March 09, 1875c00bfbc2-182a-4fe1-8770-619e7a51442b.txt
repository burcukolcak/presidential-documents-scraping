Ulysses S. Grant
March 09, 1875

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
Pursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the joint resolution of Congress approved on the 17th of June last, due notice was, on the 1st day of July last, given to the Government of Belgium, through the minister of the United States at Brussels, of the desire of this Government to terminate the treaty between the United States and His Majesty the King of the Belgians of the 17th of July, 1858. It being deemed advisable, however, that another instrument, with provisions more consonant with the interests of this country, should be entered into with that Government, I directed that negotiations should be set on foot for the purpose. They have resulted in the treaty* between the same parties of the 8th instant, which is now transmitted for the consideration of the Senate with a view to its ratification.
U. S. GRANT.
* Of commerce and navigation.
