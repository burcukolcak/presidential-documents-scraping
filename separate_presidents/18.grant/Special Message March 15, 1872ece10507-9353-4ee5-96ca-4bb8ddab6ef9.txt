Ulysses S. Grant
March 15, 1872

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I have the honor herewith to transmit to Congress a recommendation from Hon. M. D. Leggett, Commissioner of Patents, for the reorganization of his office, and also the letter of the Secretary of the Interior accompanying it.
I concur with the Secretary of the Interior in the views expressed in his letter, and recommend the careful consideration of Congress to the subject of this communication, and action which will secure a more efficient performance of the duties of the Patent Office than is practicable under present legislation.
U. S. GRANT.
