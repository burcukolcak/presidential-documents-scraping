Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return herewith, for the further consideration of Congress, House bill No. 1867, "An act for the relief of James T. Johnston," without my approval, for the reason that the records of the Treasury Department show that the lot sold in the name of J. T. Johnston, situate on Prince street, Alexandria, Va., for taxes due the United States, is numbered, 162, instead of 163, as represented in this bill. With the exception of this discrepancy in the number of the lot there is no reason why the bill should not receive my approval.
U. S. GRANT.
