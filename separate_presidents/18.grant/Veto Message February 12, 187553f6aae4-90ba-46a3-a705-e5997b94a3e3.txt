Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I have the honor to return herewith House bill No. 2352, entitled "An act granting a pension to Lewis Hinely," from which I withhold my approval for the reasons given in the accompanying letter of the Secretary of the Interior.
U.S. GRANT.
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
Washington, February 11, 1875.
The PRESIDENT.
SIR: I have the honor to return herewith House bill No. 2352, "granting a pension to Lewis Hinely."
I am informed by the Commissioner of Pensions that the act does not designate the person for whose benefit it was passed. His true name, as verified by his own signature to papers on file in the Pension Office, is Louis Heinlig, and as there were several soldiers in the company and regiment named in the act whose names are similar to that specified therein, a correction appears to be necessary in order that the beneficiary of the act may be properly identified should the bill become a law.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
C. DELANO,Secretary.
