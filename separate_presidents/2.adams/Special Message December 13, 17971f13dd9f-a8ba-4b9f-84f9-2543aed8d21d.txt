Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:
I lay before you the copy of a letter from the judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, representing the inconvenience arising from altering the time of holding the circuit court for the State of Delaware from April to June, and desiring that the existing law may be altered by restoring the spring session of the circuit court in Delaware to the 27th of April.
JOHN ADAMS.
