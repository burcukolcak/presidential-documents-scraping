Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:
Judging it of importance to the public that the Legislature should be informed of the gradual progress of their maritime resources, I transmit to Congress a statement of the vessels, with their tonnage, warlike force, and complement of men, to which commissions as private armed vessels have been issued since the 9th day of July last.
JOHN ADAMS.
