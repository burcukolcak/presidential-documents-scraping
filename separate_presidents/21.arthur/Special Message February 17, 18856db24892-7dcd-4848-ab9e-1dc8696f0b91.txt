Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
Referring to my message of the 13th instant, concerning the report of the Central and South American commissioners, I have the honor to inform the Senate that the report therein stated as accompanying the message was transmitted with a like message to the House of Representatives.
A note of explanation to this effect was inadvertently omitted from the former message.
