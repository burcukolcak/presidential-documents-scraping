Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
In further answer to the resolution of the Senate of December 12, 1881, I herewith transmit the remainder of the correspondence touching the desired modification of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. The dispatch of the Secretary of State of November 29, 1881, was not sent to the Senate with the former dispatches, because at that time no advice had been received that its contents had been communicated to the British Government.
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
