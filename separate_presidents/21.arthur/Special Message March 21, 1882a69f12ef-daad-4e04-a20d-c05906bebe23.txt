Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of the Navy, calling attention to the necessity of appropriating the sum of $12,000 under the head of "Contingent equipment and recruiting," for immediate use, to defray accruing expenses during the remainder of the current fiscal year.
The matter is commended to the favorable consideration of Congress.
