Executive Order
UNITED STATES CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION,
Washington, D.C., February 9, 1889.
The PRESIDENT.
SIR: This Commission has the honor to recommend that the order of the President fixing the places to which appointments may be made upon noncompetitive examination under General Rule III, section 2, clause (f) , may be amended by including among such places the following:
"In the Post-Office Department: Captain of the watch."
This recommendation is based upon the letter of the Postmaster-General dated December 19, 1888, in which he says:
"I would request that places in the Post-Office Department subject to noncompetitive examination be increased by including the position of captain of the watch, as the duties of the position are of such a nature that the head of the Department should be permitted to recommend for examination such person as would possess such other qualifications in addition to the merely clerical ones as would commend him to the head of he Department to fill satisfactorily such position."
Very respectfully,
CHAS. LYMAN,
United States Civil Service Commissioner.
Approved, February 11, 1889.
