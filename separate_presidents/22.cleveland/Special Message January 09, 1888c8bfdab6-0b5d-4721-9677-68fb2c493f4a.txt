Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of State, relative to the requests which have been received from various maritime associations and chambers of commerce of this country, asking that measures be taken to convoke an international conference at Washington of representatives of all maritime nations to devise measures for the greater security of life and property at sea.
I commend this important subject to the favorable consideration of Congress.
