Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 823, entitled "An act granting a pension to Hannah C. De Wilt."
An act the precise duplicate of this was passed at the present session of the Congress, and received Executive approval on the 10th day of March, 1888. Pursuant to said act the name of the beneficiary mentioned in the bill herewith returned has been placed upon the pension rolls. The second enactment is of course entirely useless, and was evidently passed by mistake.
