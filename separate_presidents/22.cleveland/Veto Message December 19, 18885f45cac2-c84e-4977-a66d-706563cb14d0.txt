Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 5080, entitled "An act for the relief of C. B. Wilson."
This bill directs the Postmaster-General to credit to the beneficiary therein named, who is the postmaster at Buena Vista, in the State of Colorado, the sum of $225, being post-office funds forwarded by him to the deposit office at Denver, but which were lost in transmission.
A general law was passed on the 9th day of May, 1888, authorizing the Postmaster-General to make allowances and credits to postmasters in precisely such cases.
On the 8th day of September, 1888, under the sanction of that law, the credit directed by this bill was made.
It is plain, therefore, that the bill herewith returned ought not to become a law unless it is proposed to duplicate the credit therein mentioned.
