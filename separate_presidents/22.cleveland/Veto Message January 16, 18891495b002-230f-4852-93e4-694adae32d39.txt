Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 7, entitled "An act granting a pension to Thomas B. Walsh."
This beneficiary enlisted January 1, 1864, and was discharged August 1, 1865.
He is reported absent without leave in April, 1864, and further recorded as having deserted November 24, 1864. He was restored to duty in May, 1865, by the President's proclamation.
He filed an application for pension in December, 1881, alleging that he contracted rheumatism in May, 1865.
This statement of the claimant and nearly, if not all, the evidence in the case which tends to show the incurrence of the disability complained of appear to fix its appearance at a date very near the return of the beneficiary after his desertion.
In these circumstances the proof of disability, such as it is, is as consistent with its incurrence during desertion as it is with the theory that the beneficiary suffered, therefrom as the result of honorable military service.
