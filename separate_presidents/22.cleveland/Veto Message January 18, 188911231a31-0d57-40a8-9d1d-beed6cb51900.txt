To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 9175, entitled "An act granting a pension to George Wallen."
The beneficiary named in this bill filed an application for pension in June, 1873, alleging as his disability a fracture of his right arm.
In a subsequent affidavit filed in 1883 he alleged deafness, which appears to be the disability upon which the special act proposed for his relief is based.
The records establish that he enlisted July 27, 1861, that he deserted April 25, 1862, and returned February 20, 1863, after an absence of about ten months, and that he deserted again April 30, 1864, and returned prior to August 31, 1864. I am informed that his record shows two enlistments and desertion during each. He was discharged December 31, 1864.
An application to remove the charge of desertion against him was denied.
Without especially discussing the question of disability chargeable to military service, it seems to me that a soldier with such a record should not be pensioned.
