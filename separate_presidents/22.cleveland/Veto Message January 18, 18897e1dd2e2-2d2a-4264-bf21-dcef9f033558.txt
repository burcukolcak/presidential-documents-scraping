Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 9296, entitled "An act granting a pension to Bridget Carroll."
This bill proposes to pension the beneficiary therein named as the dependent mother of Patrick Carroll, who was enrolled as a sergeant in the Regular Army in 1881, this being, as it is stated, his second term of enlistment.
In September, 1886, being absent from his command at Fort Warren Mass., he was drowned while sailing in a small boat with two companions.
The beneficiary is aged and in need of assistance, but there is no pretense that the soldier's death was in the least degree related to his military service.
I am sure no one could fail to be gratified by an opportunity to join in according aid to this dependent old mother of a faithful soldier, but I can not believe that such a departure as is proposed should be made from the just principles upon which pension legislation ought to be predicated.
