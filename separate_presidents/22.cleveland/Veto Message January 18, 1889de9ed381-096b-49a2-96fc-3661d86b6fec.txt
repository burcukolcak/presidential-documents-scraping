Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 9173, entitled "An act granting a pension to Mary J. Drake."
It is proposed by this bill to pension the beneficiary therein named as the widow of Newton E. Drake, who served as a soldier from August 1, 1863, to January 18, 1865.
The records do not show that he suffered from any disability during his term of service.
He filed an application for pension September 23, 1879, claiming that he contracted rheumatism about October, 1864.
He died June 7, 1881, and there does not appear to have been any evidence produced as to the cause of his death or establishing, except by the allegations of his own application, that he contracted any disease or disability in the service.
