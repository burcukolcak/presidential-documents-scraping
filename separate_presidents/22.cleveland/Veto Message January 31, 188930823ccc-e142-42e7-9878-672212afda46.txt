Veto Message
To the Senate
I return without approval Senate bill No. 3264, entitled "An act granting a pension to Mrs. Ellen Hand."
The husband of the beneficiary named in this bill enlisted August 1862, and was mustered out with his company July 10, 1865.
He filed a claim for pension in 1881, sixteen years after his discharge, alleging that he contracted rheumatism about December, 1862.
He died in February, 1883, the cause of death being, as then certified, typhoid fever.
His claim for pension on account of rheumatism seems to have been favorably determined after his death, for it was made payable to his widow and was allowed from the time of filing his petition to February 25, 1883, the day of his death.
The facts of the case as now presented appear to me to lead in the most satisfactory manner to the conclusion that the soldier's death was in no way related to any incident of his military service.
