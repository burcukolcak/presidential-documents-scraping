Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I herewith return without approval House bill No. 7018, entitled "An act granting a pension to Aretus F. Loomis."
The Commissioner of Pensions, before he became aware of the passage of this bill, directed favorable action upon the application of the claimant pending in the Pension Bureau. A certificate has been issued for the payment of a pension to him, dating from September 30, 1882.
In the interest of the claimant I therefore withhold my signature from the bill, as the pension granted by special act would only date from the time of its passage.
