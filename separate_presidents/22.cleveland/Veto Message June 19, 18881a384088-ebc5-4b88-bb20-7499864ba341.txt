To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 488, entitled "An act granting a pension to Elizabeth Burr."
It is proposed by this bill to grant a pension to the beneficiary therein named as the widow of William Burr, who enlisted for one hundred days in 1864 and was discharged on the 3d day of September in that year.
He is reported as present on all roll calls during his service. He died April 7, 1867, of dropsy, never having made any application for a pension.
His widow filed an application for pension in 1880, thirteen years after the soldier's death, alleging that the disease of which he died, claimed to be dropsy, was contracted in the service.
The claim was rejected by the Pension Bureau on the ground that the dropsy causing his death was not due to his military service, but that he was subject to the same before his enlistment.
I am perfectly satisfied that the rejection upon the ground claimed was correct.
