Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I herewith return without approval House bill No. 6897, entitled "An act granting a pension to Henry Hipple, jr."
This claimant entered the Army as a drummer August 6, 1862, and was discharged May 29, 1863.
The 1879, sixteen years after his discharge, he appears to have discovered that during his short term of military service in the inhospitable climate of Port Tobacco, within the State of Maryland, he contracted rheumatism to such an extent as to entitle him to pension, for which he then applied.
It is conceded that he received no medical treatment while in the Army for this complaint, nor does he seem to have been attended by a physician since his discharge.
Without commenting further upon the features of this case which tend to discredit it, I deem myself obliged to disapprove this bill on the ground that there is an almost complete failure to state any facts that should entitle the claimant to a pension.
