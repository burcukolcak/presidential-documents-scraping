Grover Cleveland
June 22, 1888

Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 8174, entitled "An act granting a pension to Ellen Sexton."
The husband of the beneficiary served in the Union Volunteer Army from October, 1862, to June, 1864, having been during the last seven months of his service in the Veteran Reserve Corps. He was discharged for a disability which, to say the least of it, certainly had no relation to his military service, unless the Government is to be held responsible for injury arising from vicious indulgence.
He died in the city of Cork, Ireland, May 29, 1875, of consumption, certified by the health authorities there to have been of seven years' duration.
