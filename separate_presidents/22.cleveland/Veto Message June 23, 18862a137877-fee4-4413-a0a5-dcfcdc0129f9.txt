Grover Cleveland

Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 6718, entitled "An act granting a pension to William H. Starr."
An application made by this claimant to the Pension Bureau is still pending there, and additional evidence has been called for, which the claim is awaiting before final decision.
I am of the opinion that the investigation there should be fully completed before special legislation is resorted to.
