Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return herewith without approval House bill No. 7222, entitled "An act granting a pension to Gallic West."
I base my action upon the opinion, derived from an examination of the circumstances attending the death of the claimant's husband, that his fatal disease did not have its origin in his military service and was entirely disconnected therewith.
