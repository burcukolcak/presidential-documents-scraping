Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return herewith without approval House bill No. 7436, entitled "An act to grant a pension to Mary Anderson."
This claimant is the widow of Richard Anderson, who at the time of his death was receiving a pension on account of chronic diarrhea contracted in the service.
On the 7th day of February, 1882, the deceased pensioner went to Sparta, in the State of Wisconsin, to be examined for an increase of his pension. He called on the surgeon and was examined, and the next morning was found beheaded on the railroad track under such circumstances as indicated suicide.
The claim of the widow was rejected by the Pension Bureau on the ground that the cause of the death of her husband was in no way connected with his military service.
His wife and family present pitiable objects for sympathy, but I am unable to see how they have any claim to a pension.
