To the House of Representatives:
I return herewith without approval House bill No. 6192, entitled "An act granting a pension to Mary Norman."
The husband of this claimant was enrolled May 22, 1863, and was mustered out of the service June 1, 1866.
He was wounded in the head February 20, 1864; was treated for the same, and returned to duty September 3, 1864.
In her declaration for pension, filed in February, 1880, the claimant claims a pension because of his wound and deafness consequent therefrom, and that he died after he left the service.
In a letter, however, dated October 13, 1880, she states that her husband was drowned while trying to cross Roanoke River in December, 1868.
Her claim was rejected in 1881 on the ground that the cause of the soldier's death was accidental drowning, and was not due to his military service.
In an attempt to meet this objection it was claimed as lately as 1885, on behalf of the widow, that her husband's wound caused deafness to such an extent that at the time he was drowned he was unable to hear the ferryman, with whom he was crossing the river, call out that the boat was sinking.
How he could have saved his life if he had heard the warning is not stated.
It seems very clear to me that this is not a proper case for the granting of a pension.
