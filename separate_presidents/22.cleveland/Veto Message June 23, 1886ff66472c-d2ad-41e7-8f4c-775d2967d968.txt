Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I hereby return without approval House bill No. 7298, entitled "An act for the relief of Charles Schuler."
It is proposed by this bill to grant a pension to the person above named, who was discharged from the military service in December, 1864. He filed a declaration for a pension in the Pension Bureau in January, 1883. This application is still pending. Without referring to the merits of the case, I am of the opinion that the matter should be determined by the Bureau to which it has properly been presented before special legislation should be invoked.
