Grover Cleveland
May 19, 1888

Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 6609, entitled "An act for the relief of Sarah E. McCaleb."
The husband of the beneficiary named in this bill was wounded in the head at the battle of Fort Donelson on the 15th day of February, 1862. He served thereafter and was promoted, and was discharged June 30, 1865.
He died by suicide in 1878.
He never applied for a pension.
The suggestion is made that the wound in his head predisposed him to mental unsoundness, but it does not appear to be claimed that he was insane.
I can not believe that his suicide had any connection with his army service.
