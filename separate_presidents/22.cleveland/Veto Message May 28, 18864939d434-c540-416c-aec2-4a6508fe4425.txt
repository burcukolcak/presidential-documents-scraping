Veto Message
To the Senate:
I hereby return without approval Senate bill No. 1253, entitled "An act granting a pension to J. D. Haworth."
It is proposed by this bill to grant a pension to the claimant for the alleged loss of sight in one eye and the impairment of the vision of the other.
From the information furnished me I am convinced that the difficulty alleged by this applicant had its origin in causes existing prior to his enlistment, and that his present condition of disability is not the result of his service in the Army.
