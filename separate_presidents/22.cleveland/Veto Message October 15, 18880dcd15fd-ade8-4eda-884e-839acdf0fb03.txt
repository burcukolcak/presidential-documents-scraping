Veto Message
To the Senate:
I return without approval Senate bill No. 3306, entitled "An act granting a pension to Mary K. Richards."
The beneficiary named in this bill applied for a pension on the 4th day of November, 1878, and the same was rejected in April, 1879. Her claim has lately been reexamined, and since the passage of the bill herewith returned she has been allowed a pension by the Pension Bureau, it having been there determined that the former rejection was a manifest error.
With this action of the Pension Bureau I entirely concur.
I therefore venture, notwithstanding the persistent misrepresentations of my action in similar cases, to disapprove this bill, upon the ground that this deserving beneficiary will receive under the action of the Pension Bureau a much larger sum than she would if such action was superseded by the enactment of the proposed special statute in her behalf.
