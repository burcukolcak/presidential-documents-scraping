To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 2472, entitled "An act granting a pension to Lydia A. Eaton."
The husband of this beneficiary was pensioned for chronic rheumatism, at the rate of $4 a month, up to the date of his death, August 4, 1884.
The beneficiary filed a claim for pension on the 2d day of September, 1884.
The cause of her husband's death was cystitis, which, being interpreted, is inflammation of the bladder.
The claim of the beneficiary was rejected on the ground that the fatal disease was not due to army service, and I fail to discover how any other conclusion can be reached.
