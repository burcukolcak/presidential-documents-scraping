Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 10342, entitled "An act granting a pension to John Dauper."
This beneficiary enlisted April 24, 1861, and was discharged August 1861, four months after enlistment.
He filed a claim for pension in September, 1879, alleging as cause of disability diarrhea and disease of the stomach, liver, kidneys, and bladder.
None of these ailments were established satisfactorily as originating in the soldier's brief service, and as constituting disabilities after discharge.
The claim was therefore rejected by the pension Bureau, and this action appears to be entirely justified upon the facts presented.
