Veto Message
To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 333, entitled "An act granting a pension to Catharine Bussey."
It does not appear that the husband of this beneficiary ever applied for a pension. He was discharged from the Volunteer Army on the 9th day of December, 1864, after a service of more than three years.
He was found dead on a railroad track on the 11th day of June, 1870, apparently having been struck by a passing train.
It is claimed that the deceased suffered a sunstroke while in the Army, which so affected his mind that he wandered upon the railroad track and was killed in a fit of temporary insanity.
Though it would be gratifying to aid his widow, I do not think these facts are proven or can be assumed.
