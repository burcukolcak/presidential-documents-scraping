To the House of Representatives:
I return without approval House bill No. 5593, entitled "An act granting a pension to Charles Walster."
This case has been very exhaustively examined by the Pension Bureau upon the application for a pension filed there by the beneficiary named in this bill. Upon a review of the evidence taken it appears to be well established that any disability of the beneficiary heretofore existing was no attributable to his military service.
In addition to this a board of pension surgeons, as late as July, 1886, determined, after a thorough medical investigation, that no pensionable disability existed.
It thus appears that even if this bill were approved there could be no rating, and the legislation would be of no advantage to the beneficiary named.
