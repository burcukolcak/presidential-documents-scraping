Message to Congress Announcing the Death of Admiral of the Navy David Dixon Porter
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
The Admiral of the Navy, David Dixon Porter, died at his residence in the city of Washington this morning at 8:15 o'clock, in the seventy-eighth year of his age. He entered the naval service as a midshipman February 2, 1829, and had been since continuously in service, having been made Admiral August 15, 1870. He was the son of Commodore David Porter, one of the greatest of our naval commanders. His service during the Civil War was conspicuously brilliant and successful, and his death ends a very high and honorable career. His countrymen will sincerely mourn his loss while they cherish with grateful pride the memory of his deeds. To officers of the Navy his life will continue to yield inspiration and encouragement.
