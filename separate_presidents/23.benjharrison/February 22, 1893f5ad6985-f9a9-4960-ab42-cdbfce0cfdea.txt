Remarks Hoisting the Flag on the Steamship New York
It gives me pleasure to consummate here to-day, by the act of lifting this flag, the efforts in support of a principle to which I give my hearty support.
I have felt as a citizen and as President a mortification which every American must feel who examines into the standing of the United States in the merchant marine of the world.
I believe we have reached an epoch in our development when we may successfully begin the work of carrying our share of the world's commerce upon the seas.
We lift the flag to-day over one ship, a magnificent specimen of the naval art, one of the best on any sea. That event is interesting in itself, but its interest to me is in the fact that this ship is the type and precursor of many others.
