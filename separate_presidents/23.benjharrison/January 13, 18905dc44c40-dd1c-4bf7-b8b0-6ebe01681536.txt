January 13, 1890

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State of the 13th instant, recommending that the necessary means be provided to erect suitable buildings on the grounds so generously presented in the year 1884 to this Government for the use of its legation at Bangkok by His Majesty the King of Siam.
I commend the matter to the favorable consideration of Congress.
BENJ. HARRISON
