Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a letter of the Secretary of the Navy, accompanied by the report of the commission appointed by me by virtue of a provision in the naval appropriation act approved June 30, 1890, "to select a suitable site, having due regard to commercial and naval interests, for a dry dock at some point on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico or the waters connected therewith."
The Secretary of the Navy approves the recommendations of the commission, and they are respectfully submitted for the consideration of the Congress.
BENJ. HARRISON
