Benjamin Harrison
January 20, 1890

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a letter of Professor T. C. Mendenhall, chairman of a committee of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and president of that association, and also the memorial prepared by said committee, relating to the preservation of the forests upon the public domain.
I very earnestly recommend that adequate legislation may be provided to the end that the rapid and needless destruction of our great forest areas may be prevented.
BENJ. HARRISON
