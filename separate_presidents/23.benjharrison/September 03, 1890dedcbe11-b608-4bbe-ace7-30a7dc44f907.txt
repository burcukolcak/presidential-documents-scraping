Message to Congress Transmitting a Report Relating to International Arbitration
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of State, which is accompanied by three reports adopted by the conference of American nations recently in session at Washington, relating to the subject of international arbitration. The ratification of the treaties contemplated by these reports will constitute one of the happiest and most hopeful incidents in the history of the Western Hemisphere.
BENJ. HARRISON
