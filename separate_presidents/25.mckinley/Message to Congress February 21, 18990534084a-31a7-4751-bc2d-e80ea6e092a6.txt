Message to Congress
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of State, accompanying the commercial relations of the United States for the year 1898, being the annual reports of the consular officers upon the industries and commerce of foreign countries. In view of the value of these reports to the manufacturing and exporting interests of the country, I indorse the recommendation of the Secretary of State that Congress authorize the printing of the usual editions of 10,000 copies of the general summary, entitled "Review of the World's Commerce" and of 5,000 copies of "Commercial Relations" (including this summary), to enable the Department of State to meet the demand for such information.
WILLIAM McKINLEY
