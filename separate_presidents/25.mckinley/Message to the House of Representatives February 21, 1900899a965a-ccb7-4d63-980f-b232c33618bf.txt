Message to the House of Representatives
To the House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, in response to the resolution of the House of Representatives of February 19, 1900, calling upon him to inform the House of Representatives--
1. If "Charles E. Macrum, as consul of the American Government, informed the State Department that his official mail had been opened and read by the British censor at Durban, and if so, what steps, if any, have been taken in relation thereto; and
2. "What truth there is in the charge that a secret alliance exists between the Republic of the United States and the Empire of Great Britain."
WILLIAM McKINLEY
