Message to the Senate
To the Senate:
I transmit herewith the response of the Secretary of Agriculture to the resolution of the Senate of February 8, 1899, calling for information in his possession regarding the practical usefulness of reservoirs to agriculture in the irrigated region of the United States, especially as affecting the distribution of water to crops, the area and value of reclaimed land, and the stability and unprofitableness of farming where irrigation is practised.
