Remarks Following the Election Victory in Canton, Ohio
Fellow Citizens: I thank you for the very great compliment of this call on this inclement night, and at this late hour. Of the many gratifying reports from every part of the country, none have given me more genuine and sincere gratitude than those from my own city and my own county of Stark. And I appear now only to do as I have done on so many former occasions, to thank you once more for the warm and hearty indorsement which you have to-day given my public acts.
Note: The spelling of the word "indorsement" is part of the original source text.
