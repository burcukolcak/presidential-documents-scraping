Remarks in Huntingburg, Indiana
Gentlemen and ladies:
It is a great pleasure to catch this glimpse of you and greet you on my way down to the reunion of my old regiment at San Antonio, Texas. There is one thing I am always impressed with in going through this country, and that is, down at bottom, east or west, north or south, wherever you meet the average American, he is a pretty good American.
In greeting all of you, I want to say that while I am particularly glad to see the men and the women, I think I am even more glad to see the children. I think the American stock is a middling good one, and I do not want to see it die out. I see here men who wear the button that shows that they fought in the great war. They have left us a legacy not only of how to do our duty in war, but in peace. Let us of the younger generation try to keep up their standard.
