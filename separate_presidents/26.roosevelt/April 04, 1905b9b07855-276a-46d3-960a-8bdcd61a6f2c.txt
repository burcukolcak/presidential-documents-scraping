Remarks in Milltown, Indiana
I am very glad to have the pleasure of seeing you and saying a word of greeting to you. It cannot but be pleasant to any President to have the chance of going through the country and meeting his fellow country men and being greeted as you have greeted me. I am glad to see you all—the men, the women, and the children. I am glad to see here, and wherever I go, the type of man and of woman which I believe makes the future welfare of this country—the man and woman who believe in doing their duty in facing life, knowing that life has in it any amount that is hard, but who are going to do their part to make things right for themselves and for their neighbors. There is not any thing very difficult in government. It is simply the applying of certain common-sense principles that we apply among ourselves. The man who is a decent man will be a decent husband, a decent father, a decent neighbor, and in public life he will do the right thing.
