Remarks in Wagoner, Indian Territory
It was here in this Territory that no small part of my regiment was raised, and you, my comrade there, who fought in the big war, know it means a good deal to have men with you in the trenches. I take the most extreme interest in everything that concerns your welfare. It will be but a short time now, probably, when, in conjunction with Oklahoma, you will become a great State. It is going to rest with you, upon the way in which you handle yourselves, whether you will be proud of that State or not There is not anybody that can help us do more than start along the right direction. Each one of us will stumble at times, and shame on any man who will not help his brother up; but you can't carry him. He must walk by himself.
