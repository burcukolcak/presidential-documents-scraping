Remarks in Vineta, Indian Territory
I cannot say what pleasure it is to me to be today in the Indian Territory, which I earnestly hope will soon be a part of a great State of our Union. I have never had the good fortune to be in the Territory before; but I had the great good fortune to have some of your sons in my regiment; and better and braver men never rode a horse or handled a rifle. All I need say today of them in speaking to you of the great war, is that we tried in the little war to show that we had some of the spirit that the men had who fought in the great Civil War.
You will soon be part of one of the great States of the Union (for surely we will see Oklahoma and the Indian Territory admitted to Statehood), and when that takes place you will be at the outset a great State. Then it will lie with you to see what kind of a State you make of it.
