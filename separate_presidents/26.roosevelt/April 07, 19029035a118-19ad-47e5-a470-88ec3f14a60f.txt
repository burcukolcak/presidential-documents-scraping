Remarks in Charlottesville, Virginia
I had two of your University graduates in my regimentâ€”one, John Greenway, used to be on your football eleven. I want to say how glad I am to see you, and what an interesting thing it must be to every American to come through this historic land. As we passed by the vista in the woods we saw the home of the Madisons. Your great University here is associated with the early Presidents of our country.
I see before me men who were in the Spanish war. We are here on the land fought over by those who wore the gray and those who wore the blue, and those men and their descendants now stand shoulder to shoulder as good citizens, interested in all that concerns the welfare of our common nation. It is a great pleasure to catch this glimpse of you and I thank you for your kindly reception.
