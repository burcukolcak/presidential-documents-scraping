Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with accompanying papers, relating to the claim of William Radcliffe, a British subject, for compensation for the destruction of his fish hatchery and other property at the hands of a mob in Delta County, Colo., in the summer of 1901.
I recommend that, as an act of equity and comity, provision be made by the Congress for the payment of the sum of $25,000 to Mr. Radcliffe in full settlement of this claim.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
