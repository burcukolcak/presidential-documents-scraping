Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, accompanying the Commercial Relations of the United States for the year 1903, being the annual and other reports of consular and diplomatic officers upon the industries and commerce of foreign countries.
In view of the importance of these reports to our business interests, I approve the recommendation of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor that Congress authorize the printing of an edition of 10,000 copies of the summary entitled "Review of the World's Commerce," and of 5,000 copies of Commercial Relations, including the summary, to be distributed by the Department of Commerce and Labor.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
