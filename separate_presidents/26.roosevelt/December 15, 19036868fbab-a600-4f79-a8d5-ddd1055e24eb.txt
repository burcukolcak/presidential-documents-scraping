Theodore Roosevelt
December 15, 1903

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith the report of the Commission on International Exchange constituted under authority of the act of March 3, 1903, in compliance with the request of the Governments of Mexico and China, for the co-operation of the United States in an effort to bring about a fixed relationship between the moneys of the gold-standard countries and the present silver-using countries.
The attention of Congress is invited to the accompanying report of the Secretary of State, whose request for an appropriation of $100,000 for the completion of the work of the Commission in China, and other expenditures incidental to the work of the Commission, I heartily indorse.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
