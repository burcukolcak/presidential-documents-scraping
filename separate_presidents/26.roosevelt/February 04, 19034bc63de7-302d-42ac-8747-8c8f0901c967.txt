Remarks to the National Fraternal Press Association
Gentlemen of the National Fraternal Press Association:
I am delighted and exceedingly pleased to meet you, especially in view of the nature of the interests you represent,â€”you being the representatives of institutions whose business it is to care for the home. If I am not greatly mistaken, you have the same objects in view, and are adopting largely the same methods of government which prevail in the National government of our country; and no government will ever be perfect until every citizen can say, "I am my brother's keeper." It is very gratifying to me to learn of the magnificent work your societies have already accomplished in relieving the necessities of the widows and orphans of your deceased members. In working out the great problems which confront our nation, we must depend wholly upon the sentiments which actuate and pervade your fraternities, viz., the brotherhood of man and the sacredness of American home life.
I am confident that in the final analysis, we shall find that the stability of our government depends not so much upon our armies and navies, though they maybe vastly important, but rather we will have to depend upon the brotherhood of humanity as represented in the great fraternities. The fraternal societies represented by your association are in my opinion, one of the greatest powers for good government and the protection of the home that we have in this country. This government will endure just so long as we protect the great interests respected by the fraternal orders.
I thank you, gentlemen, for this interview, and I am heartily with you in this great fraternal work, and trust that you may succeed in your present mission to Washington.
