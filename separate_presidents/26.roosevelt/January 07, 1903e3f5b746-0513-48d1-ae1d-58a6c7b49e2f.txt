Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I herewith send a letter from the Secretary of War, transmitting the third annual report of the Philippine Commission, covering the year ending October 1, 1902, and the laws passed by the Commission between July 1, 1902, and October 27, 1902.
I call your special attention to the recommendations contained in this letter of the Secretary of War. I most earnestly feel that the enactment of the measures already pending in your body for the betterment of the Philippine Islands is imperatively demanded by the situation in those islands, and serious calamity may come from failure to enact them. Furthermore, I with equal earnestness ask your attention to the recommendation of the Secretary of War in the accompanying letter and urge its adoption, so that the sum of money therein specified may be appropriated for the uses and in the manner likewise specified, in order that the present distress in the islands may be remedied.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
