Theodore Roosevelt
January 26, 1905

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith the final report of the Commission on International Exchange, constituted under the authority of the act of March 3, 1903, in compliance with the requests of the Governments of China and Mexico.
The work of the Commission has assisted greatly in the establishment of the new monetary system of the Philippine Islands, Mexico, and the Republic of Panama. The work done in China has, from the letter of the Prince of Ching, the head of the executive, been very helpful to that Government. Such improvements in the monetary systems of the silver-using countries bring them into closer connection with the gold-standard countries and are of very great benefit to the trade of the United States, and every effort should be made to encourage such reforms.
The attention of Congress is invited to the accompanying report of the Acting Secretary of State, whose request for a suitable appropriation for carrying on this valuable work in the manner which seems to him most practicable I heartily indorse and recommend to your favorable consideration.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
