Theodore Roosevelt
January 29, 1903

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with accompanying notes from the Mexican ambassador and the Chinese charge d'affaires ad interim, which seek the co-operation of the Government of the United States in such measures as will tend to restore and maintain a fixed relationship between the moneys of the gold-standard countries and the silver-using countries.
I recommend that the Executive be given sufficient powers to lend the support of the United States in such manner and to such degree as he may deem expedient to the purposes of the two Governments.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
