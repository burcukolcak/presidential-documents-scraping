Theodore Roosevelt
January 30, 1905

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I call the attention of the Congress to the fact that no statistics have been collected by the Federal Government upon the subject of marriage and divorce since the year 1886, and that but few of the States have provisions for the collection of such statistics.
The institution of marriage is, of course, at the very foundation of our social organization, and all influences that affect that institution are of vital concern to the people of the whole country. There is a widespread conviction that the divorce laws are dangerously lax and indifferently administered in some of the States, resulting in a diminishing regard for the sanctity of the marriage relation.
The hope is entertained that co-operation amongst the several States can be secured to the end that there may be enacted upon the subject of marriage and divorce uniform laws, containing all possible safeguards for the security of the family. Intelligent and prudent action in that direction will be greatly promoted by securing reliable and trustworthy statistics upon marriage and divorce. I deem the matter of sufficient general importance to recommend that the Director of the Census be authorized by appropriate legislation to collect and publish statistics pertaining to that subject covering the period from 1886 to the present time.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
