Remarks Accepting the Gift of a Horse and Saddle in Cheyenne, Wyoming
Senator Warren and friends:
I thank you most cordially. I thank you, my friends of Cheyenne, for the beautiful saddle you gave me and I thank the citizens of Douglas for the beautiful horse you have presented to me. I accept both with the greatest pleasure and I will rechristen the horse "Wyoming" to commemorate this state, and I shall be proud at Washington to be riding so fine a horse, which comes from the cow country I love so well and which produces the finest horses in the world.
I have broken the saddle, as you see. I must say that this singlefooter is a rocking chair to ride across even a rough country on his back. I couldn't have had a gift that would have pleased me more. And again I wish to thank you for these splendid gifts which will commemorate as pleasant a forty-eight hours as any President ever spent since the White House was built.
