Remarks at the Dedication of the James Milliken University in Decatur, Illinois
Mr. Milliken:
I feel that as an American citizen it is proper for me to express to you and to those like you, the obligations that good Americans feel for what you and they have done in this university and in other educational institutions throughout the land., I am especially pleased that I am to take part in the dedication of an institution of learning where so much of the teaching is to be with direct view to an industrial betterment of the country. Ours is an age of specialization and the man who is to do industrial work will find himself immeasurably better prepared for it if he can have the proper kind of industrial training.
