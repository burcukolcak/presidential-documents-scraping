Remarks on Return From Western Trip
My friends and neighbors:
I thank you very, very much for coming here to greet me this after noon, and I have appreciated more than I can say the welcome back home that I have received to-day. I have been absent over two months and I have traveled many miles. During that time one thing has struck me, and that is the substantialness of the American people. One can travel from ocean to ocean and from Canada to the Gulf and always be at home among one's fellow Americans. I thank you again, my friends, and now I am going in to my own folks.
