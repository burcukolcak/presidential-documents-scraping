Message to Congress
To the House of Representatives.
I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State in response to the resolution of the House of Representatives of June 9, 1902, requesting him, if not incompatible with the public interests, to furnish the House of Representatives with a complete list showing the names of all American citizens (and their residence) who are now detained by the British authorities as prisoners of war, together with information as to what investigation, if any, has been made by the State Department concerning the cause of their detention and what action has been taken to secure their release.
