Theodore Roosevelt
March 03, 1905

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of Commerce and Labor upon that portion of the resolution of the House of Representatives adopted March 7, 1904, having to do with the prices of cattle and dressed beef, the margins between such prices, and the organization, conduct, and profits of the corporations engaged in the beef-packing industry.
In view of the fact that the Department of Justice is now engaged upon other matters involved in the resolution, the Secretary of Commerce and Labor can not at this time report thereon.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
