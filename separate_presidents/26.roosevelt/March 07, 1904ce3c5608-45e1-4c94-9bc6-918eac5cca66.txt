Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of the Interior, with accompanying report of Charles J. Bonaparte and Clinton Rogers Woodruff, special inspectors, in the matter of alleged abuses and irregularities in the public service of the Indian Territory, and I call special attention to the condition of affairs in the Indian Territory as there set forth. In accordance with the recommendation of Messrs. Bonaparte and Woodruff, the members of the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes have been informed that if they are to continue in the service they must at once cease all connection with business operations of any kind in the Territory where it is possible that their official positions could be of any effect upon their private business, even though no such effect be in fact shown.
What further action, if any, is to be taken in regard to the Commission or any of its members by the Executive will be determined upon after full consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and careful consideration of all the facts in the case. It will be noticed that the Secretary of the Interior does not believe that it would be possible, in accordance with the suggestions of Messrs. Bonaparte and Woodruff, to close up the work of the Commission this year and discontinue it accordingly. If it should be found to be possible, I would regard this as desirable, and invite the attention of the Congress to the matter.
I also inclose a memorandum of work of the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
