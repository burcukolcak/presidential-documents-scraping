And Whereas,the Director of the United States Geological Survey, by letter dated April 15, 1904, has represented that said lands have been found suitable for townsite purposes along the line of a proposed railroad which may be extended through large tracts of land to be irrigated under the operation of said Reclamation Act, and will thereby become centers of population and necessary to the proper development of the project;
And Whereas,the Secretary of the Interior, under date of April 30, 1904, has requested that said lands be reserved for townsites to be created under existing statute;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested by sections 2380 and 2381 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, do hereby declare and make known that said lands are hereby reserved for occupation as town-sites, to be disposed of by the United States under the terms of the statutes applicable thereto.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
