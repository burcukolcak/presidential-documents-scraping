Remarks at Victorville, California
My Fellow-Citizens:
I want to say what a pleasure it is to see you. I am enjoying so much coming into California. I have looked forward toward visiting your wonderful and beautiful State for years, and I am so glad of having the chance of being here. I welcome you all. I am glad to see the men, the women, and especially the children, for I believe in your stock and I am glad it is being kept up. [Cheers and applause]
