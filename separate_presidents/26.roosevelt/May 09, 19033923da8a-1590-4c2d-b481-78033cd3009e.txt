Remarks at Oxnard, California
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I wish to say what a great pleasure it has been to be here today, and to see the tangible evidence of the extraordinary industry that has been started here within the last five years. It has been the greatest pleasure. I am not surprised at it, because the last two days in California have taught me not to be surprised at anything. And I am glad to see what has been done by your beet culture, fruit culture of every kind, irrigation, and tilling of the soil. [Applause]
