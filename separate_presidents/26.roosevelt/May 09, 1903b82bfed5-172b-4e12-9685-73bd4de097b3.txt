Remarks at Surf, California
My Fellow-Citizens:
I cannot say how much I have enjoyed these three days in California. It is the first time I ever was in your great and beautiful State; and but a few hours ago I saw for the first time the greatest of all the oceans. I have enjoyed it to the full. I have enjoyed the climate, seeing the fruits of the soil, seeing all that has been done agriculturally and industrially. I have enjoyed noting the marvelous material progress and prosperity; but what I have enjoyed most has been seeing the men and women of California. It has been to me an education to come here to California. I did not need to feel what I felt already, how much of our destiny lay on the Pacific, but I am glad to have seen your people. I have realized more even than I already realized it the fundamental oneness of the American, nation. I have come from the Atlantic across the continent, and here I am addressing an American audience with the same ideals, the same aspirations, the same hopes, the same purposes, that the audiences have on the Atlantic seaboard, or in the Mississippi Valley. I am glad to have met you. I believe in you with all my heart and soul, and I believe that your future will be even greater than your past. [Cheers and applause]
