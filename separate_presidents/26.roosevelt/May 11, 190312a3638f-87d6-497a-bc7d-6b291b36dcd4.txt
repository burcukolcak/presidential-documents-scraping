Remarks at Pajaro, California
My Fellow-Citizens:
I want to thank you for coming out to greet me this morning. I have been giving much more time to California than to any other State, and I am glad of it, for I have enjoyed every hour I have been in your beautiful and wonderful State. I have been traveling up from the South and shall now visit San Francisco, then go straight through to the North. It seems to me every good American that can should visit the Pacific Slope, to realize where so much of our country's greatness in the future will lie. I did not need to come out here in order to believe in you and your work. I knew you well and believed in you before with all my heart, but it has done me good to get in touch with you. The thing that has impressed me most coming from the Atlantic across to the Pacific has been that good Americans are good Americans in every part of this country. That is the fundamental point to remember.
I am glad to have seen you. I want to welcome the men and women, and especially the children. Of course, it is a mere truism to say that this country depends upon what the next generation is. [Applause]
