Remarks at Merced, California
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am glad to have the chance of stopping here to greet you, and to say how much I have enjoyed my trip up in your mountains and my whole trip through California. It has been the greatest possible pleasure to get out here. I have enjoyed seeing the mountains; I have enjoyed seeing your scenery; I have enjoyed witnessing the wonderful products of your climate and soil; but what I have enjoyed most has been the chance to see the men and women of California. (Cheers.)
