Remarks to the Sacramento Society of California Pioneers in Sacramento, California
I wish to thank you and the members of the Sacramento Society of California Pioneers. Of course, the members of your society must ever feel not merely a particular interest in, but a part in the development of this State such as no other can have. To you it was given in the heroic days to do the great deeds by which this republic was made in very truth the mistress of the two great oceans, for such she shall be in the years to come. It was following your guidance that our people conquered this continent and made it the base for this mighty and wonderful nation, a nation mighty in its past, mightier yet in the possibility that the looming future holds for it. I thank you most heartily and appreciate particularly the courtesy of you and your fellow-members. [Cheers and applause]
