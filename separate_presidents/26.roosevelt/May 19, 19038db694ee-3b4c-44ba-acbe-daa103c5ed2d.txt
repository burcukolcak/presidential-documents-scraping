Remarks at Auburn, California
My Fellow-Citizens:
I thank you most heartily for your kindness in coming to greet me, and I am so pleased to see you, men and women of Placer County. I have enjoyed to the full my visit to California. I have been astonished and delighted with your extraordinary success in so many different types of industriesâ€”mining, agriculture of so many kinds, manufacturing, your wonderful commerce. It is particularly a pleasure to be in a State already great, and yet with an infinitely greater future before it. But pleased though I am to see your abounding material prosperity, the products of your soil, the thing I am most pleased with is you yourselves, the men and women. It has been a great pleasure to have caught this glimpse of you. [Cheers and applause]
