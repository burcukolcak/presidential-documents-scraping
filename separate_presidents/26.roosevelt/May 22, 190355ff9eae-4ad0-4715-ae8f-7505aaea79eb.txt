Remarks in Olympia, Washington
It is no wonder the people of Washington have shown themselves true to the practices and principles of the men who fought in the great war. I have just been introduced to two of your fellow citizens, the father and mother of one of the gallant young fellows who in the Philippines captured Aguinaldo. With men such as you, and with two of your citizens, the father and mother of a boy like that, of course you are expansionists. If you were not I would want to know what was the matter with you. I congratulate Washington on its agriculture, its lumber, its mines, upon all that it produces, but most of all upon its crop of children.
