Remarks at a Luncheon Given in Honor of the President on Board the French Battleship Gaulois in Annapolis, Maryland
Mr. Ambassador:
We appreciate what France has done in sending to our shores on this occasion such a magnificent warship, and we appreciate the choice of those who were sent here; and, Mr. Cambon, we thank you for your happy good judgment in selecting such an illustrious commander of the army and navy to send to us on the auspicious occasion of the unveiling of the Rochambeau statue. One hundred and twenty years ago the valor of the soldiers and sailors of France exerted, according to the judgment of historians, the determining influence in making this country free and independent. Mr. Ambassador, I thank you personally for the courtesy which has been extended to me. It has been a source of valued information to be permitted to see and inspect this splendid French vessel, and I have been duly impressed by its superior mechanism and by the superior physique and discipline of your men. I am sure I speak for the American navy when I say it has been a source of pleasure that such a splendid specimen of French naval architecture as the Gaulois has visited our shores on such a friendly mission, and in its name I thank you. Let me, on behalf of all the people of the United States, and with the certain conviction that I have expressed their sentiments, drink to the health of President Loubet and to the continued prosperity of the mighty nation of which he is President.
