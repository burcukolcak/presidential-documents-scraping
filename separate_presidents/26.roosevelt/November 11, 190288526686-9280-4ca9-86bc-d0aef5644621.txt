Remarks at The Dedication of the Chamber of Commerce Building in New York City
Mr. President, ex-President Cleveland, gentlemen:
As I am to speak to you this evening I shall now simply say a word of greeting to you and to your guests. I have been asked here as the Chief Executive of the nation, and so I can speak not merely on your behalf but on behalf of our people as a whole, in greeting and thanking for their presence here, those representatives of foreign countries, who have done us the honor and pleasure of being present today. I greet the Ambassador whose approaching departure we so sincerely regret, the Ambassador to whom on his advent we extend such hearty greetings, and the special representatives of those great civilized nations with whom we intend to be knit ever closer by ties of commercial and social good will in the future, and now, gentlemen, having greeted your guests, on behalf of you, I greet you in the name of the people, not merely because you stand for commercial success but because this body has been able to show that the greatest commercial success can square with the immutable and eternal laws of decent and right living and of fair dealing between man and man. I greet you.
