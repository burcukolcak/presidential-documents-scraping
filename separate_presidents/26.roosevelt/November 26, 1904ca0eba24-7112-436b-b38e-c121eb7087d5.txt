Remarks at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri
Mr. Commissioner:
I wish to thank you from my heart for the kind words that you have just spoken. At this exposition the great Republic of France has a peculiarly appropriate part; the great nation whose people worked so much in the past for the discovery and settlement of this continent, and the people that took this infant nation by the hand to help it up into the circle of powers. One of your publicists has used the expression the "peace of justice," and I am particularly pleased at what you said as to the efforts of this country to bring about throughout the world the "peace of justice."
I wish to propose a toast to President Loubet and the French nation and may the bonds of friendship that have ever united them with the United States of America be even tightened in the future.
