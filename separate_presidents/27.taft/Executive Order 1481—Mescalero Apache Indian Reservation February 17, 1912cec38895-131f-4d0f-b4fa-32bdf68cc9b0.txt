Executive Order 1481â€”Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation
Under authority of the act of Congress of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat., 11 at 34 and 36), and upon recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, it is hereby ordered that on and after March 1, 1912, the boundaries of the Alamo National Forest, N. Mex., as proclaimed March 2, 1909, and modified by subsequent proclamation of October 20, 1910, be further modified by excluding therefrom all of that part of the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation included in the said Alamo National Forest by the said proclamation of March 2, 1909.
The purpose of this exclusion is to restore the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation in all respects to the status existing prior to the said proclamation of March 2, 1909, as though the inclusion of the lands within the Alamo National Forest had not been ordered, and said Indian reservation is hereby fully recreated and restored to that status.
