Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
I have the honor to transmit herewith a communication from the Acting Secretary of War, under date of May 8, submitting the report, with accompanying exhibits, of Hon. Charles E. Magoon, provisional governor of Cuba, for the period from December 1, 1908, to January 28, 1909, when the provisional government was terminated and the island again turned over to the Cubans. I recommend, in accordance with the suggestion of the Acting Secretary of War, that this report and the exhibits be printed.
I think it only proper to take this opportunity to say that the administration by Governor Magoon of the government of Cuba from 1906 to 1909 involved the disposition and settlement of many very difficult questions and required on his part the exercise of ability and tact of the highest order. It gives me much pleasure to note in this public record the credit due to Governor Magoon for his distinguished service.
The army of Cuban pacification under Major-General Barry was of the utmost assistance in the preservation of the peace of the island and the maintenance of law and order, without the slightest friction with the inhabitants of the island, although the army was widely distributed through the six provinces and came into close contact with the people.
The administration of Governor Magoon and the laws recommended by the advisory commission, with Colonel Crowder, of the Judge-Advocate-General's Corps at its head, and put into force by the governor, have greatly facilitated the progress of good government in Cuba. At a fair election held under the advisory commission's new election law, General Gomez was chosen President and he has begun his administration under good auspices. I am glad to express the hope that the new government will grow in strength and self-sustaining capacity under the provisions of the Cuban constitution.
