Remarks at the Palazzo Reale in Milan, Italy
I can not tell you how much complimented I am by your coming in person to give me this greeting. I have never known such a greeting as the people of Milan have given me on the streets. It has brought tears to my eyes, because I know that it comes from their hearts. I can see in their faces the same things that I feel towards them, and I know that it is an impulse of their friendship towards the Nation that I represent as well as a gracious welcome to myself. I want to reecho the hope that we may all work together for a great peace as distinguished from a mean peace. And may I suggest this, that is a great deal in my thoughts: The world is not going to consist now of great empires. It is going to consist for the most part of small nations apparently, and the only thing that can bind small nations together is the knowledge that each wants to treat the others fairly. That is the only thing. The world has already shown that its progress is industrial. You can not trade with people whom you do not trust, and who do not trust you. Confidence is the basis of everything that we must do, and it is a delightful feeling that those ideals are sustained by the people of Italy and by a wonderful body of people such as you have in this great city of Milan. It is with a sense of added encouragement and strength that I return to Paris to take part in the counsels that will determine the items of the peace.
I thank you with all my heart.
APP Notes: The President was greeted by Victor Emmanuel III of Savoy and a large delegation.
