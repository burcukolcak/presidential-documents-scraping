Remarks to the League of Mothers and Widows in Milan, Italy
I am very much touched by this evidence of your confidence, and I would like to express to you if I could the very deep sympathy I have for those who have suffered irreparable losses in Italy. Our hearts have been touched. And you have used the right word. Our men have come with the spirit of the crusades against that which was wrong and in order to see to it, if it is possible, that such terrible things never happen again. I am very grateful to you for your kindness.
