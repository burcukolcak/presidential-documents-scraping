Remarks on the Balcony of the Palazzo Civico in Turin, Italy
My friends of Turin, I now have the privilege of addressing you as my fellow citizens. It is impossible at this distance that my voice should reach all of you, but I want you to know that I bring the greetings, and affectionate greetings, of the people of the United States to the people of Italy and the people of the great city of Turin. My sentiment, coming from the heart, is the sentiment of the American people. Viva, l'Italia!
