Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives..
I now inclose sundry documents supplementary to those communicated to you with my message at the commencement of the session. Two others of considerable importance--the one relating to our transactions with the Barbary Powers, the other presenting a view of the offices of the Government--shall be communicated as soon as they can be completed.
TH: JEFFERSON.
