Thomas Jefferson
December 31, 1803

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I now lay before Congress the annual account of the fund established for defraying the contingent charges of Government. No occasion having arisen for making use of any part of it in the present year, the balance of $18,560 unexpended at the end of the last year remains now in the Treasury.
TH: JEFFERSON.
