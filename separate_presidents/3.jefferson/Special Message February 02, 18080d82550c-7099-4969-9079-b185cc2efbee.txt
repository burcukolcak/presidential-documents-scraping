February 02, 1808

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
Having received an official communication of certain orders of the British Government against the maritime rights of neutrals, bearing date the 11th of November, 1807, I transmit them to Congress, as a further proof of the increasing dangers to our navigation and commerce, which led to the provident measure of the act of the present session laying an embargo on our own vessels.
TH: JEFFERSON.
