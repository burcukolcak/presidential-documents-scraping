February 18, 1802

Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
In a message of the 2d instant I inclosed a letter from the Secretary of' War on the subject of certain lands in the neighborhood of our military posts on which it might be expedient for the Legislature to make some provisions. A letter recently received from the governor of Indiana presents some further views of the extent to which such provision may be needed. I therefore now transmit it for the information of Congress.
TH: JEFFERSON.
