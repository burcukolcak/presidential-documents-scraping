Thomas Jefferson
January 15, 1806

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I now render to Congress an account of the grant of $20,000 for the contingent charges of Government by an act making appropriations for the support of Government for the year 1805. Of that sum $1,987.50 have been necessarily applied to the support of the Territorial governments of Michigan and Louisiana until an opportunity could occur of making a specific appropriation for that purpose. The balance of remains in the Treasury.
TH: JEFFERSON.
