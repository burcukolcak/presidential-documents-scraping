January 17, 1806

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
The inclosed letter from the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at the Court of London contains interesting information on the subjects of my other message of this date. It is sent separately and confidentially because its publication may discourage frank communications between our ministers generally and the Governments with which they reside, and especially between the same ministers.
TH: JEFFERSON.
