Thomas Jefferson
March 22, 1804

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I lay before Congress the last returns of the militia of the United States. Their incompleteness is much to be regretted, and its remedy may at some future time be a subject worthy the attention of Congress.
TH: JEFFERSON.
