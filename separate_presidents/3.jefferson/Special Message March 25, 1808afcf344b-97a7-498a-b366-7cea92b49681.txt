Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I transmit to both Houses of Congress a report from the surveyor of the public buildings of the progress made on them during the last session, of their present state, and of that of the funds appropriated to them. These have been much exceeded by the cost of the work done, a fact not known to me till the close of the season. The circumstances from which it arose are stated in the report of the surveyor.
TH: JEFFERSON.
