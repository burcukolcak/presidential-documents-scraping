Calvin Coolidge
April 25, 1924

Excerpts of the President's News Conference
PRESS: May I ask if you can elaborate on what you have just said on the immigration bill?
PRESIDENT: I am attempting to see if there is any way that that question can be solved so as to satisfy those that want to have restriction and at the same time prevent giving any affront to the Japanese Government.
