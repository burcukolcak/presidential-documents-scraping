Excerpts of the President's News Conference
Here is another pertinent question that I should have referred to in relation to the developments at London. I should judge that the probable effects there would be exceedingly good on American business conditions. I should expect that it would stimulate business, I don't mean export business, but a general feeling that at last we are reaching a stage where we can see stable conditions in Europe, and that would mean a stabilizing of conditions here, and a minimizing of the present uncertainty, so that people would feel that they could go ahead with their business enterprises.
