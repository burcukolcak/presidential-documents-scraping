December 07, 1923

Excerpts of the President's News Conference
An inquiry as to whether I was gratified with the reaction to my message. I was very much gratified, of course. A great many telegrams have been coming in with very kind comment. Also on the part of the newspapers. It is in a good many instances flattering. Perhaps you had prepared them.
PRESS: Mr. President, what type of people do you hear from on this?
PRESIDENT: Well, very general and promiscuous. Different people. All kinds of people seem to be sending in telegrams.
