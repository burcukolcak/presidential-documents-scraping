Excerpts of the President's News Conference
Here is an inquiry about the offer of the Russian Government to enter into negotiation for a restoration of diplomatic relations. That has been answered by the State Department in a statement that has been given out to the press within an hour, and the answer in general effect is that no action is necessary on the part of this Government for the Russian regime to comply with the conditions that were laid down in my message. That can be done entirely by them without negotiating with us, and should be done as a foundation for any negotiations. I suppose you recall, generally, the restoration of property, recognition of the debt, and the cessation of propaganda against our institutions. Those were all the result of acts taken there, and can be remedied by acts now to be taken there.
