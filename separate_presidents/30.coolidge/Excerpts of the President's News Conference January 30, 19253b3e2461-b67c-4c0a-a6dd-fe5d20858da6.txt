Calvin Coolidge
January 30, 1925

Excerpts of the President's News Conference
I don't think I can make any comment relative to the proposals of the French and German Governments for a security pact [the Locarno Agreements] for the guarantee of European peace. I don't know any way that America could cooperate in that. It seems to me that it is almost entirely a European political subject in which we can't take any very helpful part.
