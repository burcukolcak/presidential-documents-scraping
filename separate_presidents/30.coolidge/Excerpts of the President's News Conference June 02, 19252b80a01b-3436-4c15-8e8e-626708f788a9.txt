Excerpts of the President's News Conference
This line, as I understand it, of the graduating class will move before me and I am to hand them their diplomas. I don't understand that I am to hand diplomas to any one except those that are actual graduates of the Academy. Now if someone wants to take a picture of the line and other scenes to present the life of the Academy, I am perfectly willing to have that done. The only embarrassment about it, as I say, is that perhaps one moving picture concern would have that and another wouldn't, but every motion picture concern is going to have the privilege of taking the picture of me and to make use of it in any legitimate way they wish in the ordinary carrying on of their business. As I said at the outset, I want always to help every legitimate concern in the United States. My only embarrassment is that there are so many competing concerns that those who didn't get the picture would say this is a kind of apple sauce. [Stenographer's note: Laughter broke out which continued during the next two or three sentences of the President and prevented accurate reporting of what he said. As near as could be heard the President stated that other concerns would then wish to make apple sauce, and that he would probably be deluged with requests to sample their apple sauce and he should have to say that the conduct of the public business wouldn't enable him to partake of it.]
