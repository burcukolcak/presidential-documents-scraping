Calvin Coolidge
March 07, 1924

Excerpts of the President's News Conference
PRESS: Did the newspapermen make any suggestions, Mr. President, or give you any aid [regarding a successor to Secretary Denby]?
PRESIDENT: Well, I think some of them have been suggestive. I haven't got quite as many as I expected. Perhaps it isn't so easy as it may have appeared to pick out the right kind of a man.
