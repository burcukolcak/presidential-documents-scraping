Excerpts of the President's News Conference
I haven't any plan other than that which was outlined in my address before the Associated Press at New York, relative to another conference of the powers for the purpose of disarmament or the consideration of the codification of international law. I don't know whether both of these questions could be considered in the same conference. The question of disarmament is one that affects certain large powers. The question of international law is one that affects all the nations of the world. I should think from what information I have now that it would not be practical to call one during the summer. There is a political campaign that will be going on during that time, and I don't know now what the condition in Europe will be. I indicated in my New York address that before there would be much hope of a successful conference it is necessary to have European questions settled, so far as they can be, and a more composed state of mind there than there apparently exists at the present time. There are very hopeful in-dications that a settlement will be made in Europe, but when, no one can tell. They have had elections in Germany. Elections I think are to be held this month in France. Those elections may have something to do in determining what the attitude of France may be, and after the elections I suppose it will be some time before the coming in of those who are chosen, and naturally it will take some time after that to arrive at a settlement on the part of the governments concerned. With all those things in mind, I don't see how it could be possible to think that there was a practical hope of success for having a conference during the summer here.
