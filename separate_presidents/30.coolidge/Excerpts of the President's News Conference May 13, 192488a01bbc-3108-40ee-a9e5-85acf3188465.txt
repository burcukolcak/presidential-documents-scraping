Calvin Coolidge
May 13, 1924

Excerpts of the President's News Conference
I have here another inquiry that I hesitate some to comment about, though perhaps I can with the understanding that there is not any undue prominence given to it, or any undue emphasis placed upon it. It is an inquiry about my going to the circus. It is no doubt an experience that all of us look back to with a good deal of pleasure. The first circus I ever went to was in Ludlow, Vermont, a railroad station about 14 miles from Plymouth.
