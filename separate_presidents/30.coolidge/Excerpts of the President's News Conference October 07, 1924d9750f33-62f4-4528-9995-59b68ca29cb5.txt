Excerpts of the President's News Conference
I haven't hastened about appointing the Committee to look into the agricultural situation because, as I indicated in my speech of acceptance, the agricultural situation has seemed to be to quite an extent taking care of itself, and this Committee or Commission I was proposing to appoint not so much for relieving the situation at the present time which has already been relieved by the rise in prices, as for taking advantage of the present condition which follows one of relief and seeing if we can take some action to prevent a recurrence of the conditions that confronted agriculture during the period of low prices. If there had been any emergency I would have acted on that. Then I have some people that I want to consult about it that I haven't been able to get hold of as quickly as I expected. My own thought was to find out what could be done while we have a breathing spell to prevent a recurrence of the decline and the period of the low prices of wheat, cattle, hogs and the larger staples of farm production at the present time when it is at a very fair level. I expect to appoint this Committee as soon as I can confer with two or three leaders in the farm movement, in order to see what we can do to prevent a recurrence of the bad situation that agriculture found itself in after the period of deflation.
