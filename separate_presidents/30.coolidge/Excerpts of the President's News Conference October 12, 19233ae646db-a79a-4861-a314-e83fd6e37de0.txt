Calvin Coolidge
October 12, 1923

Excerpts of the President's News Conference
I have another inquiry, I don't know whether I covered that, about the proposal of Lloyd George for an entente between the United States and Great Britain to maintain the peace of the world. That, as I have explained, is an unofficial proposal made by a prominent man, but not made by the Government of Great Britain in any way. Should it be made by the Government of Great Britain, why we would take it up and consider it then. Coming, as it does, in this way, I think we will have to regard it as a speech and I don't care to make any particular comment about it.
