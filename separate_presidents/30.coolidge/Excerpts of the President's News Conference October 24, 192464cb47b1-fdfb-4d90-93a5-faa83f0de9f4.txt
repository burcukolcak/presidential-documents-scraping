Calvin Coolidge
October 24, 1924

Excerpts of the President's News Conference
PRESS: Mr. President, what are the reports from Minnesota? I understand the latest report is that the Republicans are going to carry Minnesota?
PRESIDENT: I haven't any specific reports about any states. My reports indicate that I shall probably carry Northampton. That is about as far as I can go into details. That is based more on experience.
