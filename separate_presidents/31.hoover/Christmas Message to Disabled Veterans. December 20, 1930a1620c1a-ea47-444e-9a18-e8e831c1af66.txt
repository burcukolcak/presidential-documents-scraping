Christmas Message to Disabled Veterans.
To All Disabled Veterans:
Again I send you my Christmas Greeting and best wishes for your happiness in the New Year, with renewed assurances of the Nation's grateful remembrance of your service and sacrifices.
I do pray that the New Year will bring you many blessings and new hope for the future; to those in hospitals, or ill in their homes, restoration of health; and to all, more of comfort and contentment.
The Nation is ever mindful of your patience and fortitude, is vigilant in your behalf, and so long as your need endures will respond with devotion to your service.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message was sent to veterans' organizations and hospitals throughout the country.
