Exchange of Messages With Albert, King of the Belgians, on Memorial Day.
To His Majesty The King of the Belgians:
I am deeply moved by Your Majesty's tribute to the memory of those of my countrymen who gave their lives in the great cause and whose bodies rest in Belgian soil. All Americans with one accord thank Your Majesty and the Belgian people for this evidence of affection and for the Belgian flowers which tomorrow will lie on American graves.

The memory of the heroism of the American troops who fought by our side for the liberation of our land is forever graven on the hearts of the Belgian people.
It is with deep emotion and gratitude that, on the thirtieth of May, my fellow country-men will again strew flowers upon the graves of the sons of the great Republic who sleep in Belgian soil.
United in our sentiment of gratitude, we address to the friendly American Nation our cordial wishes for its prosperity.
