Herbert Hoover
August 29, 1929

Exchange of Remarks With Hugo Eckener, Commander of the Graf Zeppelin.
Dr. Eckener:
It gives me great satisfaction personally to congratulate you upon this noteworthy attainment. It shows that the spirit of high adventure still lives. Its success has been due to the eminent scientific and engineering abilities of the German people, translated by your own skill and courage. You have already witnessed the universal appreciation of the American [p.272] people of your accomplishment. You have given a most valuable service to aviation; you have added to the luster of your countrymen and you have lifted the spirits of men with renewed confidence in human progress.
Note: The President spoke at the White House at 3 p.m. on Thursday, August 29, 1929. Dr. Eckener's reply was translated by Dr. Otto C. Kiep, Charge d'Affaires of the German Embassy in Washington, as follows:
Mr. President:
I am deeply grateful for the gracious address you have been pleased to extend to me. You have been kind enough to appreciate what the ship, officers and crew have achieved, and we are proud of such appreciation. I wish to say, however, that the achievement could not have been put through without the assistance of the United States, and I wish to avail myself of this occasion to express my appreciation.
