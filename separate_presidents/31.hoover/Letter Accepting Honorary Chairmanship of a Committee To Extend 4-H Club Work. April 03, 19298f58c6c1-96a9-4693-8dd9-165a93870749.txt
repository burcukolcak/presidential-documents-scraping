Letter Accepting Honorary Chairmanship of a Committee To Extend 4-H Club Work.
[Released April 3, 1929. Dated March 27, 1929]
My dear Mr. Wilson:
The work of the 4-H Clubs is fundamental. It is bringing about a more economic production of all agricultural crops; it is improving [p.57] rural homes; it is developing rural leadership, molding character and building citizenship.
Therefore I accept with pleasure the Honorary Chairmanship of the National Committee on Boys' and Girls' Club Work which has for its purpose the extension of the membership of the Clubs so that additional thousands of farm boys and girls may be given greater opportunities for development and achievement.
Faithfully yours
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Thomas E. Wilson, Chairman, National Committee on Boys' and Girls' Club Work, 58 East Washington Street, Chicago, Illinois]
