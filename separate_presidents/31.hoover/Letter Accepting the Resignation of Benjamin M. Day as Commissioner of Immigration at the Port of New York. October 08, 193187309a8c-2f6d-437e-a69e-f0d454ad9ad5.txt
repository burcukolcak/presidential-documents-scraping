My dear Captain Day:
I have been holding up your letter of resignation as I was in hopes it might be withdrawn. I learn from Mr. Hilles, however, that you wish to have it accepted so I cannot do other than comply with your wish.
I take this occasion to express my appreciation for the devoted public service you have given during the past years.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
