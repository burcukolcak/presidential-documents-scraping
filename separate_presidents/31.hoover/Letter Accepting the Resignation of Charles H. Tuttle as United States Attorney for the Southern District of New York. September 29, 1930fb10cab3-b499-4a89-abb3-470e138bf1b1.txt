Letter Accepting the Resignation of Charles H. Tuttle as United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.
Dear Mr. Tuttle:
I beg to acknowledge your telegram requesting that your resignation as United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York should be made effective at once instead of the date which you had previously requested.
In accepting your resignation I take the opportunity of expressing my personal appreciation and that of the Administration for the faithful and efficient service you have rendered the Government as the representative of the Department of Justice in the largest and most important district of the country, and in maintaining the high standards which have been traditional in the office of the United States Attorney in your district. You have indeed established a high record of accomplishment.

I am,

Sincerely yours,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. Charles H. Turtle, United States Attorney, New York, N.Y.]
Note: Mr. Tuttle served as United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1927 until his resignation. His resignation came in conjunction with his nomination as the Republican candidate for Governor of New York.
