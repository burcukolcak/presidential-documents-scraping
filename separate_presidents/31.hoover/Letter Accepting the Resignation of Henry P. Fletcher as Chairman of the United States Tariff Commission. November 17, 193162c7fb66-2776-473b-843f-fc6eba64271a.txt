November 17, 1931

Letter Accepting the Resignation of Henry P. Fletcher as Chairman of the United States Tariff Commission.
My dear Chairman Fletcher:
I have your letter of November 17th tendering your resignation as Chairman of the United States Tariff Commission, to be effective November 30th.
In accepting it I wish to express the keen appreciation I have for the great public service you have rendered. Under your Chairmanship the work of the Commission has made great progress in consummation of the hopes which were placed in its reorganization and increased authority. That a large number of cases have been considered and disposed of and the heavy docket for the year almost completed, all bespeak the devotion and effectiveness of the Commission's work.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. Henry P. Fletcher, U.S. Tariff Commission, Washington, D.C.]
Note: Mr. Fletcher served as Chairman of the United States Tariff Commission from September 1930 until his resignation. His letter of resignation and a memorandum on the work of the Commission, both dated September 17, 1931, and released with the President's letter, follow:
Dear Mr. President:
I hereby tender my resignation as Chairman and Member of the United States Tariff Commission effective November 30 next.
I enclose a memorandum summarizing the work accomplished since the Commission was reorganized fourteen months ago. This memorandum shows that with one or two exceptions all the investigations requested by Senate or House Resolutions have been completed. The petroleum, copper, and vegetable oil investigations are in final form and will be submitted, as requested by the Resolutions, to the Congress when it assembles next month. The most important investigation now pending is that relating to raw and refined sugar which was recently ordered and which in the nature of the case may be protracted as growing as well as refining costs both at home and abroad are involved. Work on this and all other pending applications and investigations is proceeding as rapidly as circumstances permit.
The recent depreciation in exchange in a number of countries exporting to the United States has rendered our cost data, secured before these countries departed from the gold standard, inapplicable in view of the present instability of exchange values and negative reports were sometimes unavoidable in cases where the exchange factor entered. The facts gained in our investigations, however, are all assembled and can be utilized in case further investigation may become necessary.
The Commission has been completely reorganized and is, I believe, thoroughly equipped to perform its important functions.
It is a pleasure to express my appreciation of the loyal and efficient cooperation and support I have received from my colleagues on the Commission and from every member of its staff.
Faithfully yours,
HENRY P. FLETCHER
[The President, The White House]
Enclosure.
MEMORANDUM
WORK OF THE UNITED STATES TARIFF COMMISSION
Since the Tariff Commission was reorganized, its work may be briefly summarized as follows:
By November 30, the effective date of the Chairman's resignation:
--39 separate rate investigations, covering a very large number of items, and different rates of duty, will have been completed and reported upon under Section 336 of the Tariff Act.
--11 important surveys (not involving rate changes) will also have been completed.
--Of the 9 investigations discontinued, 8 were dismissed by Senate Resolutions.
--5 applications were withdrawn by proponents.
--28 applications were dismissed by the Commission after careful preliminary investigation.
--Thus 92 cases will have been disposed of.
There remains on the Commission calendar 10 rate investigations and 1 survey, all in response to Senate Resolutions, and 8 rate investigations of other origin, making a total of 19 investigations and surveys in progress.
Twenty-one applications for investigations are on file, some of which may be granted and some denied, depending upon the facts developed by preliminary investigation by the Commission.
Thus the Commission has 40 investigations, surveys, and applications on its books compared with 92 disposed of since reorganization.
The Commission is, of course, engaged in other routine work assigned to it including the American Valuation study called for under Section 340 of the Tariff Act of 1930, investigations under Section 337, Surveys, etc.
The first seven of the following surveys have been completed and the reports published, while the last four are practically completed and reports are being prepared for submission to the Congress next month:
