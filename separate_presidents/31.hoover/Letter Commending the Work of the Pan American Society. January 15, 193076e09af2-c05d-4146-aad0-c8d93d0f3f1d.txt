Letter Commending the Work of the Pan American Society.
[Released January 15, 1930. Dated November 13, 1929]
Dear Mr. Merrill:
I have learned of your proposed visit throughout the United States with a view to the organization of branches of the Pan American Society in a number of our larger cities.
I am much interested in the work of the Pan American Society in its promotion of friendly relations and mutual understanding between the United States and its sister republics of Latin America, and I am confident that you will find on your tour a great many of our citizens throughout the country who will be specially interested in your undertaking and who will grasp the opportunity of cooperating with you most heartily in the creation of branches of the Pan American Society in our more important cities.
I wish you every success in the efforts you and your associates are putting forth along these lines.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. John L. Merrill, President, Pan American Society, 67 Broad Street, New York City]
