Letter Congratulating Felix M. Warburg on Receiving the Gottheil Medal.
[Released May 10, 1930. Dated May 8, 1930]
My dear Mr. Warburg:
It is indeed gratifying that your many benefactions and the unwearied service of your wisdom and humane spirit should again be recognized in the award to you by the Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity of the Gottheil Medal for distinguished service to the cause of Judaism. It is one of the highest virtues of our democracy that it inspires such service and that it recognizes it with public honor.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Felix Warburg, New York City]
Note: The letter was read at the annual dinner of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity held in the Park Central Hotel, New York City.
The Gottheil Medal was awarded annually to a person judged to have given the greatest service to American Judaism.
