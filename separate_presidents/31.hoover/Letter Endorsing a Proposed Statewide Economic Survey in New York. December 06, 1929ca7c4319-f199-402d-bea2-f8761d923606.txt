Letter Endorsing a Proposed Statewide Economic Survey in New York.
[Released December 6, 1929. Dated November 29, 1929]
Dear Mr. Hart:
I have your request that I should comment upon the state-wide economic survey that is proposed through the committee with which you are associated. I am glad to do so.
The distinguished service accomplished in much the same way by the creation of the New England Council and the California Development Association is outstanding demonstration of the importance of such action. This larger view of the problems within the state and their relation to public questions is sure to produce the most constructive results, and I wish the committee every success in its efforts.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Merwin K. Hart, Chairman, Committee of Twenty-Five, New York Statewide Economic Congress, Utica, New York]
Note: The Committee of Twenty-Five was formed from leading businessmen to establish specific policies to increase industry in New York State.
