Letter Requesting Walter S. Gifford To Be Director of the President's Organization on Unemployment Relief.
[Released August 19, 1931. Dated August 17, 1931]
Dear Mr. Gifford:
It is clear that, irrespective of the improvement in employment, many localities in the United States will be faced during the coming winter with a heavy relief load due to unemployment.
In order that every preparation may be made to meet in an effective way such needs as may arise, I am asking you to set up and direct such organization as may be desirable, with headquarters in Washington to cooperate with the public authorities and reinforce the national, state and local agencies which will have responsibility for the relief activities arising out of unemployment in various parts of the nation this winter.
I am asking you to do this because of my long acquaintance with work you have done in similar fields and it is my desire that you should use your own judgment as to the type of organization you set up and its methods of work. This care of misfortune is our first duty to the nation. The whole force of the Administration is at your disposal. Based upon my experience of some years in such problems I am sure we shall compass this task.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Walter S. Gifford, American Telephone & Telegraph Company, New York City]
