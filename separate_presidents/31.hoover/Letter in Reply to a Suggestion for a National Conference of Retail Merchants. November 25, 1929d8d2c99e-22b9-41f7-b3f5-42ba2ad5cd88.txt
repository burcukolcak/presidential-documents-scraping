Letter in Reply to a Suggestion for a National Conference of Retail Merchants.
[Released November 25, 1929. Dated November 22, 1929]
My dear Mr. Liberman:
I have received your kind telegram of November 21st. I wish to express my appreciation of your kind suggestion. I will give it most careful consideration as the situation develops. Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Meyer Liberman, Arnold Constable & Company, New York City, N.Y.]
Note: The President's letter was in response to Meyer Liberman's telegram of November 21, 1929, suggesting a retail merchants' conference. Mr. Liberman's telegram follows:
The retail establishments, including the department stores of this country, do business mounting into billions and give employment to hundreds of thousands of men and women. Any unsettling of this phase of American commercial life is bound to intensify pessimism and endanger the business stability of this country.
May I urge that such a conference be held under your auspices at the earliest moment for the purpose of appealing to merchants, manufacturers and others to refrain from cancelling orders, reducing working staffs and curtailing buying and advertising appropriations ?
The retail business is the crux of America's commercial life and the cooperation of the merchants of this country would go far toward reestablishing the present impaired confidence.
