Letter on the Retirement of Hubert Work as Chairman of the Republican National Committee.
Dear Mr. Williams:
On the occasion of Dr. Work's determination to retire from the Chairmanship of the Republican National Committee, I should like through you, to place in the record of the National Committee the high appreciation I hold, and which I know the country generally holds for the many public services given by Dr. Work. He has given his long life of public usefulness in many directions.
He long since demonstrated his leadership in his own profession as President for many years of the Colorado State Board of Health, President of the American Psychiatric Society, and finally as President of the American Medical Association and as a Colonel in the Medical Service during the World War.
He has given much to party service, beginning twenty years ago as Chairman of the Republican State Convention of Colorado, a member for many years of the Republican National Committee and during the past successful campaign, Chairman of the National Committee.
In public office he has been successively Assistant Postmaster General, Postmaster General and Secretary of the Interior, with a record for administrative capacity, honesty and courage at each step.
Dr. Work can quite well feel that he is entitled to a rest and I know that the Committee joins with me in expression of appreciation, not [p.279] alone for his service to the party but also for so distinguished a career in public service.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The President's letter was sent to Ralph E. Williams, first vice chairman of the Republican National Committee, who read it at a special meeting held at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., where Claudius Huston was elected to succeed Dr. Work.
