Letter to Chairman Clarence D. Clark Regarding His Position in the International Joint Commission.
[Released April 25, 1929. Dated April 18, 1929]
My dear Senator Clark:
I regret deeply that the condition of your health has been such of late as to give anxiety to your friends, and seems to preclude the strain which would ensue from important negotiations which are likely to be designated to the International Joint Commission.
Furthermore, none of the section east of the Mississippi River, which comprises a large part of our boundary relations with Canada, is now represented on the Commission. These areas are pressing strongly that they should be represented, especially in view of the character of problems that are now likely to arise.
Under these dual circumstances I feel it would be desirable to make a change in the Commission in the matter of the position held by you and I should be glad to know if this would meet with your convenience.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable Clarence D. Clark, International Joint Commission, Washington, D.C.]
Note: The International Joint Commission, with three members from the United [p.125] States and three from Canada, was organized in 1911 to prevent disputes and settle questions concerning the use of boundary waters between the two countries.
Mr. Clark, who served as United States Senator from Wyoming from 1895 to 1917, was appointed to the Commission on July 16, 1919, and was elected Chairman of the United States Section on April 15, 1923. He retired on April 25, 1929, at the age of 78.
