[Released November 8, 1931. Dated October 29, 1931]
My dear Mr. Justice:
Mrs. Hoover and I wish to be early in conveying to you our warmest congratulations on your seventy-fifth birthday. It is not necessary for us to remind you of the many satisfactions which have crowned your public service and that you reflect a heart and mind which have made the nation your debtor.
Even during your service as a member of the highest Court in the land you have found time to give service to the advancement of the Jewish homeland and I have no doubt this has brought happiness and comfort to thousands. We wish you many happy returns of the day.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. Louis D. Brandeis, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Florence Courts West, Washington, D.C.]
