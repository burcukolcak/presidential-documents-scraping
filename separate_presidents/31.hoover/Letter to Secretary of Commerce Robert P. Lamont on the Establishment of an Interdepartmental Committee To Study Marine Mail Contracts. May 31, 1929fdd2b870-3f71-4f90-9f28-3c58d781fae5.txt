Letter to Secretary of Commerce Robert P. Lamont on the Establishment of an Interdepartmental Committee To Study Marine Mail Contracts.
[Released May 31, 1929. Dated April 26, 1929]
My dear Mr. Secretary:
A number of problems arise under the Merchant Marine Act in [p.173] relation to contracts which may be let over 10 year periods for carriage of the postal mail.
It is the intention of the law that these contracts should be used in such fashion as to upbuild and strengthen the merchant marine both for the present and the future. The Postmaster General feels that the question involves many problems which affect the Merchant Marine and upon which it is desirable that he should have considered advice of the other interested branches of the Government.
I am, therefore, appointing a committee comprising yourself as Chairman, with a membership consisting of the Postmaster General, the Secretary of the Navy and Chairman O'Connor of the Shipping Board--this committee to consider and make recommendations bearing upon this question.
I may mention that it would be desirable to appoint a sub-committee of experts in the various departments for the preparation of detailed material for submission to the Committee.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable, The Secretary of Commerce, Washington, D.C.]
