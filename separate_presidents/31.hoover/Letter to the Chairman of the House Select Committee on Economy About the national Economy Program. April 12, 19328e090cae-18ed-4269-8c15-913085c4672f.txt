Letter to the Chairman of the House Select Committee on Economy About the national Economy Program.
My dear Mr. McDuffie:
In view of the real progress achieved at our conference on Saturday toward a national economy program, it seems to me that the most expeditious and businesslike way to achieve the conclusive results which we all desire would be to continue these conferences until, through discussion, mutual exchange of views and a thorough canvass of detail, such a definite national economy program can be prepared. I believe furthermore that the businesslike and effective way of assuring enactment of the legislation would be to embody the program so agreed upon into a single bill which would be presented to. the House of Representatives as representing a non-partisan cooperative effort to reduce the cost of government.
If the views of your committee coincide with mine I shall appreciate it very much if the committee will meet with me again tomorrow at some hour suitable to your convenience.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable John McDuffie, House of Representatives]
Note: The President met with the members of the select committee from 3 to 6:30 p.m. on April 13, 1932.
