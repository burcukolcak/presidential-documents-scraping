My dear Mr. Chairman:
I am in receipt of your letter of July 1st in respect to Investigation of Methods of Valuation in Section 642 of the Tariff Act.
I would like to suggest that this investigation should be undertaken by the Commission with the appointment of an advisory body comprising representatives from the Customs Service, the Department of Commerce and such other agencies as the Commission may think desirable to coordinate.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
