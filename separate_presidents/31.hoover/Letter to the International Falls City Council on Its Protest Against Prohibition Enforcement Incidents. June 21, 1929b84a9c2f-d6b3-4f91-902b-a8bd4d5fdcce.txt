[Released June 21, 1929. Dated June 18, 1929]
Gentlemen:
I have your telegram of today's date. The matter has been referred to the Treasury Department for action.
You may rest assured that there is no intention on the part of the Federal Government in any way to transgress the limits of the law.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[City Council, International Falls, Minnesota ]
Note: The text of the City Council's telegram follows:
Dear Mr. President:
The International Falls City Council voted and passed upon the following resolution:
"Whereas, at an open meeting of business men and city officials of this border city last June 14 an informal appeal to the President was drawn up, asking him to end the terrorism inflicted upon our citizens and neighbors by Federal customs patrolmen, engaged in prohibition enforcement;
"And whereas, this appeal has remained unanswered, even though the vicious and unlawful conduct of said Government agents have continued unabated-except that there has been no fresh murder of one of our innocent neighbors;
"Therefore, be it resolved that we, the City Council of the City of International Falls, in regular session assembled, do hereby remind the President that the memorialization of the citizens' appeal was and is the articulate pleading of the community;
"And be it further resolved that the City Council of the City of International Falls does hereby join its official voice in requesting from our President an urgent response to the plea for help from our people."
INTERNATIONAL FALLS CITY COUNCIL.
[Hon. Herbert Hoover, Washington, D.C.]
