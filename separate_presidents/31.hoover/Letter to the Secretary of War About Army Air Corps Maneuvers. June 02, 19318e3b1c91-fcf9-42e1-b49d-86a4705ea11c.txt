Letter to the Secretary of War About Army Air Corps Maneuvers.
My dear Mr. Secretary:
I wish to congratulate you and the Air Corps on the remarkable success achieved in the maneuvers just terminated.
To have mobilized, from all parts of the country, a force of 672 airplanes and maneuvered it from the middle west to, and along, the eastern seaboard from Maine to Virginia without any serious mishap, is very convincing evidence of the efficiency of the Army's air forces.
I am especially gratified to know that all three components of the Army of the United States--Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve--participated so creditably in this instruction.
You and your subordinates in the War Department by the successful organization and execution of these exercises have reflected great credit upon our military establishment. Faithfully yours,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Colonel Patrick J. Hurley, Secretary of War]
