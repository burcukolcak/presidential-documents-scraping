Letter to the Speaker of the House Recommending an Immediate Appropriation for River and Harbor Works
Sir:
It appears that the regular War Department appropriation act for the fiscal year 1933 will be delayed beyond the usual time. The Budget estimate for the maintenance and improvement of existing river and harbor works for 1933 is $60,000,000, which would become immediately available upon the passage of the act. I am now advised by the Secretary of War that, depending upon the usual course of appropriations, the engineers have entered upon certain contracts, the continuance of which have depended upon the passage of the appropriation at the usual time. As delay seems inevitable and unless some action be taken, a large number of men will be thrown out of work and other expenses incurred by suspension of work. I therefore recommend that the Congress give consideration to immediate appropriation of the funds for the maintenance and improvement of existing river and harbor works in order that we may avoid the unemployment and dislocation which will arise from such delays. Such a course would imply no increase in the contemplated expenditures.

I inclose herewith the recommendations of the Director of the Budget.

Respectfully,
HERBERT HOOVER

The White House,
Washington, D.C., March 14, 1932.
