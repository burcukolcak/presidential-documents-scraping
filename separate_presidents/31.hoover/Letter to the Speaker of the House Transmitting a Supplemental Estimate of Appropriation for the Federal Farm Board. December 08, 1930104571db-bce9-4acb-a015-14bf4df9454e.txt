Letter to the Speaker of the House Transmitting a Supplemental Estimate of Appropriation for the Federal Farm Board.
Sir:
I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress a supplemental estimate of appropriation for the Federal Farm Board for $150,000,000 to be immediately available as a part of the revolving fund of $500,000,000 authorized to be appropriated by the Agricultural Marketing Act approved June 15, 1929. Under date of June 18, 1929, $150,000,000 was appropriated by Public Act No. 15 and under date of March 26, 1930, $100,000,000 was appropriated in the first deficiency act fiscal year 1930 for this revolving fund. In order that important operations of the Board, now in prospect, may be carried through promptly additional funds are required at this time.
The details of this estimate, the necessity therefor and the reasons for its transmission at this time are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, which is transmitted herewith and with which I concur.
This sum was included in the estimate of expenditures before Congress and does not increase the estimated deficit.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Speaker of the House of Representatives]
