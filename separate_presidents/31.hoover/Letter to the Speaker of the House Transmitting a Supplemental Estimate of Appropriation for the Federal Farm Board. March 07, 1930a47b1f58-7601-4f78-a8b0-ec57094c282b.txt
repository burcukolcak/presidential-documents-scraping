Letter to the Speaker of the House Transmitting a Supplemental Estimate of Appropriation for the Federal Farm Board.
Sir:
I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress a supplemental estimate of appropriation for the Federal Farm Board for $100,000,000, to be immediately available, as a part of the revolving fund of $500,000,000 authorized to be appropriated by the agricultural marketing act approved June 15, 1929. Under date of June 18, 1929, $150,000,000 was appropriated by Public Act No. 15 in response to my estimate of June 15, 1929, in which it was stated that "if the board finds it necessary to have further funds it should be possible to make provision for them in ample time, as Congress will no doubt be in session by the time they are required." The need for additional funds has now arisen.
The details of this estimate, the necessity therefor, and the reasons for its transmission at this time are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, which is transmitted herewith, and with which I concur.

Respectfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
THE WHITE HOUSE,

It is now estimated that an additional amount of $100,000,000 will be required in the revolving fund to carry out projects now planned by the board, and that this sum should be made immediately available.
