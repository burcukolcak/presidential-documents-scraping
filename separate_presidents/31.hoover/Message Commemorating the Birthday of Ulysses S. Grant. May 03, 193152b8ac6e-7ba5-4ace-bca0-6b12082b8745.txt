[Released May 3, 1931. Dated April 29, 1931]
My dear Major Harmon:
I am glad to learn of the exercises to be held by the Veterans of Foreign Wars of New York City honoring the memory of General Ulysses S. Grant on Sunday next. Beyond his fame as a great military leader, his memory will forever be cherished by the whole country for his chivalrous consideration in victory and for his nobility of spirit in desiring the immediate healing of the spiritual wounds of war.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Major Leonard J. Harmon, 898 West End Avenue, New York City]
Note: The message was read at exercises commemorating the 109th anniversary of Grant's birth. The New York County Council of the Veterans of Foreign Wars sponsored the exercises, which were held at Grant's Tomb in New York City.
