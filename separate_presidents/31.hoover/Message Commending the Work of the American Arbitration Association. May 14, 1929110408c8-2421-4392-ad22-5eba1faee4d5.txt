Message Commending the Work of the American Arbitration Association.
[Released May 14, 1929. Dated May 10, 1929]
My dear Mr. Eastman:
Arbitration of commercial disputes in place of avoidable litigation increases business efficiency by promoting good will and mutual confidence. Expeditious, regular settlement of business controversies within industry itself, by its own experts, is fundamental, but machinery is needed to make it effective. The American Arbitration Association provides a practical mechanism through which the method can be applied. I wish the fullest success to the business men meeting under the auspices of the Association to discuss this useful subject.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Lucius R. Eastman, President, American Arbitration Association, 521 Fifth Avenue, New York City]
