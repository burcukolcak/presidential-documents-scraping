Message Congratulating John Barton Payne on His 75th Birthday.
[Released January 27, 1930. Dated January 10, 1930]
My dear Judge Payne:
Your seventy-fifth birthday will recall to the memory of your many friends, as it does to mine, a wealth of reminiscence of your numberless public services and private kindnesses. We are all glad that you still buoyantly bear your part in these activities, and as we congratulate you upon your anniversary we also wish for ourselves many more years of your comradeship.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
