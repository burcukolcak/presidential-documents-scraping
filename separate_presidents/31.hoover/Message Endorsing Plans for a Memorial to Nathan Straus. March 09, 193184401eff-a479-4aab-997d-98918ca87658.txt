Message Endorsing Plans for a Memorial to Nathan Straus.
[Released March 9, 1931. Dated March 3, 1931]
My dear Mr. Janssen:
I always had the highest admiration for the late Nathan Straus and when plans for a suitable memorial to his memory reach the stage where all are agreed as to what it shall be, I shall be glad to help further that project.

I appreciate warmly your pleasant personal references.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
