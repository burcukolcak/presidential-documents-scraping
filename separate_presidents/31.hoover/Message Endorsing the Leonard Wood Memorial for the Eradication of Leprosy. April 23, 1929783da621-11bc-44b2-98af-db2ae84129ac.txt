Message Endorsing the Leonard Wood Memorial for the Eradication of Leprosy.
[Released April 23, 1929. Dated April 18, 1929]
I WISH to express my sympathetic interest in The Leonard Wood Memorial for the Eradication of Leprosy, and to commend this great humanitarian effort now being made in the Philippines by your organization. The accomplishment of the aim of The Leonard Wood Memorial is in the highest degree commendable and is not only a fitting monument to one of our noblest citizens, but a means of expressing a spirit of real helpfulness towards the Filipino people, and eventually to the world, through the eradication of the ravages of this dread disease.
