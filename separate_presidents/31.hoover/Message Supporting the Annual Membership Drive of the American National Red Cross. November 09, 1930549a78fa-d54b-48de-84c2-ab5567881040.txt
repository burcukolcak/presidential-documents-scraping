Message Supporting the Annual Membership Drive of the American National Red Cross.
[Released November 9, 1930. Dated October 29, 1930]
I TRUST that the Red Cross membership drive this year may be more responsive than ever before. The Red Cross is our national insurance against the suffering of disaster in any part of our country. It is not charity in the normal sense of gift without obligation. It is supported by all of us and the day may come when any of us may have claims upon its assistance or protection.

Note: John Barton Payne, Chairman of the American National Red Cross, enrolled the President on November 8, 1930, as the first citizen to join the annual drive which officially began on Armistice Day and ended on Thanksgiving Day.
