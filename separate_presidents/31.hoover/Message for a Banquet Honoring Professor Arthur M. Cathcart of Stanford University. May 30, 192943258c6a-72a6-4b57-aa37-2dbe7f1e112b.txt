My dear Sirs:
I am sorry that I cannot be present in person, but I shall be present in spirit to share with you in paying respects and honor to my old friend and great servant of the University, Professor Arthur Martin Cathcart on the completion of his twenty-five years as teacher of law at Stanford University. On my behalf please extend to him my congratulations and best wishes for many more years of equally distinguished service.
Yours faithfully,
