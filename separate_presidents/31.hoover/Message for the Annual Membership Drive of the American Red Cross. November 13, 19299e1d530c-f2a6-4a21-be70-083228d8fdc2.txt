Message for the Annual Membership Drive of the American Red Cross.
[Released November 13, 1929. Dated November 12, 1929]
BOTH as President of the United States and as President of the American Red Cross, I earnestly bespeak the cooperation of every American citizen in the great humanitarian work of the Red Cross. Its prompt efficiency in time of disaster, and its continuing service in numerous less spectacular but no less important tasks of relief, make it an indispensable part of our national life. Every American should be a member. and I urge all to enroll.
