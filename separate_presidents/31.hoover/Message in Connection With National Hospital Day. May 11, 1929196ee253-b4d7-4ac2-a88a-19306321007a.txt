Message in Connection With National Hospital Day.
[Released May 11, 1929. Dated April 1, 1929]
The growth of public hospitals in this country is one of the finest manifestations of the equality of opportunity that is the foremost aspiration of the American people. Our citizens will never rest content until the poorest children in our cities, the loneliest mothers on our most isolated farms, have the comfort and protection of such institutions. I am glad to lend the encouragement of the Presidency to the movement symbolized by National Hospital Day.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
