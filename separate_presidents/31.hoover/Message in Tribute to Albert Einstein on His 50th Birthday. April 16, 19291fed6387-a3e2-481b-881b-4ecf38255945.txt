Message in Tribute to Albert Einstein on His 50th Birthday.
My dear Mr. Bernstein:
I cordially approve the plan to pay tribute to Professor Albert Einstein on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his birthday.
Professor Einstein ranks high among the foremost scientists of all time, who have enriched mankind by their invaluable contributions to thought and human progress. Every important scientific achievement is a step forward in the direction of better universal understanding and good will.
It is very fitting that distinguished educators and other public spirited Americans are paying this tribute to Professor Einstein.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
