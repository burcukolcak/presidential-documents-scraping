Message in Tribute to Julius Rosenwald.
[Released March 27, 1932. Dated March 22, 1932]
AS ONE WHO was a friend of Julius Rosenwald I call to memory this morning that friendship and its inspiring associations of many years, and I join with you, his friends, in memorializing the full and goodly life that was his.
I recall how, guided by his keen intellect and great heart, he directed his wealth into those channels which inspiration and study convinced him were for the best service of his fellow men. I further recall that where there were no channels, he surveyed and dug them, recognizing no barrier of creed or race. I am thinking too at this moment of that great enterprise in human engineering in which the Joint Distribution Committee has now been engaged for more than a decade, and which was undertaken primarily because his vision and his benefaction made it possible to begin it, and constituted so important a part of its total support. Surely the good which he has done will serve as an inspiration for humanitarian effort for generations to come, and will constitute an imperishable memorial to him--the only one he would have wished.
Note: The message was read during memorial services for Mr. Rosenwald at the annual meeting of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. The meeting was held at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City.
