Message in Tribute to Thomas Alva Edison.
MRS. HOOVER and I regret that we cannot be with you but are glad to have the opportunity of joining in your tribute to the genius of Thomas A. Edison on this anniversary. The debt which this country and indeed the whole world owes to Mr. Edison is everywhere recognized, but in this universal acclaim let us not forget the fine and admirable character, the lofty soul of the man to whom we owe so much. Here also is a source of pride to all Americans.
HERBERT HOOVER
[James W. Bishop, Edison Institute, Dearborn, Michigan]
Note: The message was read at ceremonies, held at the Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich., commemorating the 50th anniversary of the opening of the first commercial electric lighting and generating plant in New York City.
