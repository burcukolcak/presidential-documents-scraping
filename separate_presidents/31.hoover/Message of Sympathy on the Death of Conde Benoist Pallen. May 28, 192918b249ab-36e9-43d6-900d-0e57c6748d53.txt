Message of Sympathy on the Death of Conde Benoist Pallen.
[Released May 28, 1929. Dated May 27, 1929]
My dear Mrs. Pallen:
In these dark first moments of your sorrow I hesitate to write to you because I have not had the privilege of acquaintance with you and your late husband, but I cannot forbear to send you my sincerest sympathy and to say how great is, I feel, the public loss of the whole country in the death of one who gave so largely to the men and women of his time of the rich fruits of a sincere and high-minded search for the everlasting truths. I pray that such thoughts as these may help you bear your loss.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Conde Benoist Pallen, Blackstone Hotel, New York City]
Note: Conde Benoist Pallen was the author of poems and books and an editor of various Roman Catholic publications.
