Message of Sympathy on the Death of Edward Alfred Simmons.
[Released October 3, 1931. Dated October 2, 1931]
My dear Mrs. Simmons:
I was greatly shocked to learn of the death of Colonel Simmons who had long been my friend. He had a distinguished career of public service and his passing is indeed a great loss.

I am in hopes you will have the strength to bear up under this burden.

Yours faithfully,
[Mrs. Edward A. Simmons, 1625 Ditmas Avenue, Brooklyn, N.Y.]
Note: Mr. Simmons, president of the Simmons-Boardman Publishing Company, died on September 30, 1931.
