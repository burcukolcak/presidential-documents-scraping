Message of Sympathy on the Death of Mrs. Elizabeth Mills Reid.
IT WAS A great shock to both Mrs. Hoover and me to learn this morning of the passing of your mother. She has been so true and loyal a friend and has contributed so much to national welfare in a thousand directions that her death becomes both a personal and a national loss. We wish you and Mrs. Reid to know that you have our deepest sympathy.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message was sent to Mrs. Reid's son, Ogden Reid, publisher of the New York Herald Tribune. Mrs. Reid, widow of former Ambassador Whitelaw Reid, had been active in welfare and philanthropic endeavors.
