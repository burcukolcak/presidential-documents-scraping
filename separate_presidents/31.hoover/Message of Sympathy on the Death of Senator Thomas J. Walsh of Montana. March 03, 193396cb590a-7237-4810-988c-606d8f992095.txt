Message of Sympathy on the Death of Senator Thomas J. Walsh of Montana.
I AM PROFOUNDLY shocked to learn of the death of your distinguished husband, and Mrs. Hoover joins me in expressing our deepest sympathy with you in the tragic bereavement. Senator Walsh's public service has been so varied and so distinguished as to make his fame secure and his absence from us a grievous public loss.
Note: Senator Walsh served in the United States Senate from March 4, 1913, until his death on March 2, 1933. He died near Wilson, N.C., en route to Washington, D.C., to accept appointment as Attorney General in President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt's cabinet.
