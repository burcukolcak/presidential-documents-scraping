My dear Mrs. Redfield:
I am deeply grieved to learn of the death of your husband, who was my good friend and distinguished predecessor in the Department of Commerce. His services to country were so varied and valuable as to earn the gratitude of the Nation and his character won him the high regard of a host of friends. I send you my profound sympathy in your. bereavement.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
