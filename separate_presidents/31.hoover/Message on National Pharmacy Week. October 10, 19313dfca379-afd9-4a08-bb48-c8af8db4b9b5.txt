Message on National Pharmacy Week.
[Released October 10, 1931. Dated September 25, 1931]
My dear Mr. Mayes:
The observance of National Pharmacy Week, October 11th to 17th, is an appropriate time to recognize the service which pharmacy renders to the public health. Research in scientific laboratories constantly adds to the armamentarium of our health forces. The drug stores of the land are the channels through which these new resources for treatment of the sick and the prevention of disease are brought promptly within reach of the people. Pharmacists are the indispensable allies of the physicians. The importance of high standards of product and professional practice in pharmacy may well be more generally recognized, and Pharmacy Week is a commendable educational effort to that end.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Herbert R. Mayes, Editor, American Druggist, 57th Street at Eighth Avenue, New York City]
