Message on National Thrift Week.
[Released January 17, 1932. Dated January 16, 1932]
My dear Mr. Stout:

Thrift is not hoarding. It is the wise provision against future needs.
Provision against future needs involves savings and wise spending for insurance, home ownership and many other constructive, sensible and discriminating actions. Thrift Week, appropriately beginning Benjamin Franklin's birthday, January 17th, can contribute to the nation of these concepts. I trust that it may help to realize these and necessary objectives.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. J. Robert Stout, National Thrift Committee, 347 Madison Avenue, New York City]
Note: The message was released in conjunction with the launching of Thrift Week, which was held from January 17 to January 23, 1932.
