Message on Rosh Hashanah.
I SEND my cordial greetings to those loyal and devout Jews who are about to celebrate Rosh Hashanah. The Jewish race has made numberless invaluable contributions to the progress of humanity, but none so precious as their contribution to the spiritual life of mankind. Their fellow citizens of every race and creed share in extending to them the greetings of good will and good wishes on the Jewish New Year.
HERBERT HOOVER
