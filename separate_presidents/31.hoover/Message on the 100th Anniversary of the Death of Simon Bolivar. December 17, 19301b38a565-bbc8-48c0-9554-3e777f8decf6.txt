Message on the 100th Anniversary of the Death of Simon Bolivar.
[Released December 17, 1930. Dated November 5, 1930]
THE PEOPLE of the United States join with me in honoring the memory of the Great Liberator, Simon Bolivar. All the nations of the American Continent owe him a debt of gratitude not only because of his military achievements, but also by reason of his prophetic political vision which enabled him to lay the foundations of Pan Americanism as well as to foresee the important part which the nations of America are called upon to play in world affairs.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson read the President's message at a special session of the Governing Board of the Pan American Union honoring the memory of Simon Bolivar. Messages from all the American Republics were also read at the meeting held in the Pan American Building in Washington, D.C.
