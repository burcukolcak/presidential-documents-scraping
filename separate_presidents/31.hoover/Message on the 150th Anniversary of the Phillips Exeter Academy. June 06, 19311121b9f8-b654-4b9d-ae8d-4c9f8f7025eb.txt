Message on the 150th Anniversary of the Phillips Exeter Academy.
[Released June 6, 1931. Dated June 1, 1931]
Dear Mr. Lamont:
One cannot contemplate the history of the Phillips Exeter Academy, which substantially parallels the existence of the American Republic, without recognizing in the celebration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Academy an event of national interest and significance.
The record and ideals of this pioneer school are a major contribution to education in the United States. From the institution has flowed for a century and a half a stream enriching the public service and the culture of our country. The school has achieved in practice the high ideals of education envisaged by its founders and their successors. I wish, therefore, to extend my most cordial congratulations and good wishes on the occasion of the memorable milestone attained on June sixth.

Faithfully yours,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Thomas W. Lamont, 23 Wall Street, New York City]
Note: The message was read at exercises commemorating the anniversary of the academy in Exeter, N.H.
Thomas W. Lamont, a prominent banker who graduated from the academy in 1888, presided over the afternoon program.
