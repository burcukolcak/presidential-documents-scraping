Message on the Award of the Montclair Yale Bowl to Eugene Meyer.
[Released December 5, 1931. Dated November 30, 1931]
My dear Mr. Roberts:
I am happy to be informed that the Yale Club of Montclair will award its Yale Bowl this year to Honorable Eugene Meyer, Governor of the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Meyer's service to the country during the war and as Federal Farm Loan Commissioner, member of the Federal Farm Loan Board and of the Federal Reserve Board, have made the nation his debtor. His financial acumen and insight have been invaluable in dealing with problems of the first magnitude in the field of international as well as national credit organization and stability. The award represents discrimination and judgment on the part of the givers as well as recognizing the merit of the receiver of this honor.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Nicholas Roberts, 565 Fifth Avenue, New York City]
