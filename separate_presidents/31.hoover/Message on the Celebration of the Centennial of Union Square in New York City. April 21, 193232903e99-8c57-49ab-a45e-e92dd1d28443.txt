Message on the Celebration of the Centennial of Union Square in New York City.
[Released April 21, 1932. Dated April 19, 1932]
My dear Mr. Plyer:
I am interested to learn of the celebration of the centennial of the official opening of Union Square as a public park by the City Council of New York, because of my firm belief in the value of preserving historical traditions as a stimulus to local pride in community progress. The historical interest of the park, running far back of the formal dedication of 100 years ago, and its evolution through residential and retail business uses to its present importance as a centre of industry, finance and commerce, give it a distinctive quality deserving commemoration. I congratulate your committee, and the business interests which it represents, upon this successful celebration of a significant occasion.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. A. M. Plyer, Chairman, Union Square Centennial Committee, Everett Building, 45 East 17th Street, New York City]
