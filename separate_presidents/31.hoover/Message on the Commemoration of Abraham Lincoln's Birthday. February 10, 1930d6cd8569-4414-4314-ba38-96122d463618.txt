Message on the Commemoration of Abraham Lincoln's Birthday.
THE SPIRIT of Abraham Lincoln more and more permeates the political ideals of our people. His greatness of heart, his wide comprehension of issues, and his patience, his belief in the people--are touchstones of democracy and of practical government.
Abraham Lincoln believed in party government. He held that government by the majority was one of the most essential principles of democracy, and that the majority could not express its will except through party organization. He believed that political parties must have a spirit as well as a program. He endowed the Republican Party with a great tradition, a sense of organization and a sense of responsibility to all the people which has dominated its spirit since his day.
It is a sure instinct and a worthy thing that brings the members of the Republican Party together each year to commemorate his birth. I would be glad if you would convey my greetings and good wishes upon this occasion.
Note: The message was sent to Ernest C. Moore, president of the Lincoln Club of Southern California, Los Angeles, Calif.
