Message on the Death of David Belasco.
FROM HIS BOYHOOD in San Francisco David Belasco brought to his national career an adventurous quality of imagination and a freedom from precedent that helped him to pioneer those new paths in the world of the theatre which were so distinctly his contribution to the art of the theatre. His vivid personality will be deeply missed by the whole country.

[A. J. McCosker, Director WOR, 1440 Broadway, New York City]
