Message on the Dedication of Memorials to Three Prominent Ohio Republicans.
[Released September 17, 1932. Dated August 13, 1932]
My dear Mr. Lampson:
I am deeply interested to learn of your praiseworthy efforts to erect suitable memorials at Jefferson, Ohio, to Joshua Reed Giddings and B. F. Wade, who played so large a part in the founding of the Republican Party, and to my dear friend, the late Senator Theodore E. Burton, whose life was a noble pattern of the high-minded public servant. I wish you support and success.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. E. C. Lampson, Editor, The Jefferson Gazette, Jefferson, Ohio]
Note: The message was read at ceremonies, sponsored by the Republican Party, in Jefferson, Ohio, which featured the dedication of 10 bronze tablets commemorating events connected with the party's history.
