Message on the Dedication of a World War Shrine in Hoboken, New Jersey.
[Released May 24, 1931. Dated May 14, 1931]
My dear Dr. Armstrong:
I am deeply interested to learn of the dedication at St. Paul's Church, Hoboken, on Sunday May 24th, of a World War Shrine commemorating Hoboken as the Port of Embarkation and Debarkation and the place where so many of our soldier dead lay under the flag upon their return from service abroad. It is indeed fitting that such a Shrine should be adorned with memorials of their supreme sacrifice, and that our countrymen should resort there for remembrance.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Rev. Frank C. Armstrong, Chairman, World War Shrine, St. Paul's Church, Hoboken, N.J. ]
