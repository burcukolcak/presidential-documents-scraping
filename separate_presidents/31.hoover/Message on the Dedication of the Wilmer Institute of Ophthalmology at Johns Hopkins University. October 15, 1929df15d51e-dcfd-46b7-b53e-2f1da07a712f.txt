Message on the Dedication of the Wilmer Institute of Ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University.
YOU AND your board and associates as well as the Johns Hopkins University are to be congratulated on the dedication of the Wilmer Institute of Ophthalmology. The enlarged opportunities for the alleviation of human suffering that you and your staff will now utilize are due I understand to the indefatigable effort of Mrs. Henry Breckenridge and I ask you to transmit to her my greetings on this memorable occasion.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Dr. William Holland Wilmer, Wilmer Institute, Johns Hopkins Medical School, Baltimore, Maryland]
