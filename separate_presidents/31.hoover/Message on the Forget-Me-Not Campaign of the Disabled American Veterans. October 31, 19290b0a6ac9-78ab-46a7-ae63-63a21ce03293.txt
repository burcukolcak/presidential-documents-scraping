Message on the Forget-Me-Not Campaign of the Disabled American Veterans.
[Released October 31, 1929. Dated September 7, 1929]
My dear Mr. Murphy:
The work of the Disabled American Veterans in relieving distress amongst those still suffering from the effects of war service is most praiseworthy, and I trust that your annual Forget-Me-Not campaign will bring forth a generous response from the public.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. William J. Murphy, National Commander, Disabled American Veterans, Munsey Building, Washington, D.C.]
