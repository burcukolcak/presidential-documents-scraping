Message on the Formation of the Committee of One Hundred in Dayton, Ohio.
[Released October 14, 1931. Dated October 13, 1931]
I CONGRATULATE Dayton upon its formation of the Committee of One Hundred and I wish to express my appreciation of your leadership in the movement. I understand the immediate purpose of this community movement on the part of Dayton is to cooperate in furtherance of the request I made last week for "national unity of action in an American way to assist business, employment and agriculture." Dayton's method of responding to this emergency is characteristically American in its quick initiative, its energy and its flexibility to local conditions and needs. The fundamental essence of your plan is community action carried out through voluntary cooperation. That is the American way.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. James M. Cox, Dayton, Ohio]
Note: The message was read to 100 Dayton citizens, representing commercial, industrial, and civic groups, at a meeting called by former Governor James M. Cox.
