Message on the III Olympic Winter Games.
[Released March 11, 1931. Dated February 4, 1931]
Dear Dr. Dewey:
I am interested to learn of the III Olympic Winter Games to be held at Lake Placid in 1932. The friendly rivalry of the athletes of the nations not only develops sportsmanship but also contributes to the advance of international good-will and fellowship.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Dr. Godfrey Dewey, President, III Olympic Winter Games Committee, Lake Placid, New York]
Note: The message was read at a luncheon meeting of the Olympic Winter Games Committee, held at the India House in New York City. The meeting was held to launch a fund-raising campaign to raise $250,000 for the games through private subscriptions.
