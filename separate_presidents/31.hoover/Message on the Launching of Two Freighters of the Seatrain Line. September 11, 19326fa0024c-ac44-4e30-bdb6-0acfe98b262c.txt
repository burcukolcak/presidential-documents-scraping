Message on the Launching of Two Freighters of the Seatrain Line.
[Released September 11, 1932. Dated September 1, 1932]
My dear Mr. Brush:
I congratulate you and your associates most cordially upon the double launching during this month of the two new freighters of your lines at Chester, Pennsylvania. In their speed and the novelty of their design they indicate again how resourcefulness and ingenuity of American designers and operators may facilitate the development of our invaluable ocean borne commerce.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Graham M. Brush, President, Seatrain Lines, Inc., 39 Broadway, New York City]
Note: The President's message was made public in conjunction with an announcement that the Seatrain New York, the first of the two freighters, would be launched at Chester, Pa., on September 14, 1932. The sister ship, Seatrain Havana, was scheduled to be launched on September 24.
