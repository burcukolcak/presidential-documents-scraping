My dear Rabbi Landman:
I am gratified to learn that the American Hebrew Medal for the Promotion of Better Understanding between Christian and Jew in America is to be awarded this year to Dr. John H. Finley, whose high-minded and effective service to so many causes in the public interest has earned for him a high place in the affection and gratitude of the people, and by whom this fresh honor is highly merited.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
