My dear Mr. McCosker:
I send you my warmest congratulations on your unanimous election as President of the National Association of Broadcasters at the recent annual convention in St. Louis. It is especially noteworthy that you were chosen from the field of Independent Broadcasters-
In view of the vast scope of radio broadcasting in the United States and the direct impress it makes upon the minds of the people, its possibilities for good in advancing industrial, scientific, cultural and amusement interests, this is a signal honor and a high responsibility, which your character, broad experience, and achievements give promise of successful discharge in the public interest. You have my cordial good wishes in this work.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
