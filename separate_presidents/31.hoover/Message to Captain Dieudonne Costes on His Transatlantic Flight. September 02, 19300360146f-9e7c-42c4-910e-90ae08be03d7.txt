THE NEWS of your successful flight thrills the people of the entire American nation and upon their behalf and my own I send to you and your gallant companion Monsieur Maurice Bellonte our heartiest congratulations. We shall delight to honor the heroic compatriots of those other brave Frenchmen whose undaunted efforts foreshadowed this triumph. Our people's welcome to you is wholehearted and universal.

Only a few minutes had passed after Maurice Bellonte and myself had landed upon the American soil when your heartfelt congratulations reached us. We beg you, Mr. President, to accept our deepest appreciation of your kindest words which have touched both of us very profoundly. The American and French people have had the great privilege of always entertaining the most friendly relations. Nothing would please us more than the thought that our successful flight might constitute to strengthen these reciprocal feelings.
