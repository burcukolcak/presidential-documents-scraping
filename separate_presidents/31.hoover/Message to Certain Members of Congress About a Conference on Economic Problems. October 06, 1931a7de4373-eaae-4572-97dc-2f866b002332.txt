Message to Certain Members of Congress About a Conference on Economic Problems.
[Released October 6, 1931. Dated October 3, 1931]
I AM ASKING leaders in certain committees who may be in reach to meet with me at the White House at nine o'clock Tuesday evening next upon an urgent national matter. I am anxious that you should come. In order to avoid harmful speculation I should deeply appreciate it if no information of the call should be given out. I will be glad to place a plane at your disposal if you desire.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: On the same day, the White House issued a list of 26 Members of the Congress to whom the telegram was sent.
