Message to Dedication Ceremonies for the Institute of Paper Chemistry at Lawrence College.
[Released September 23, 1931. Dated September 18, 1931]
My dear Mr. Mahler:
I regretted that the pressure of the public business prevented my accepting your gracious invitation to address the dedication of the new building of the Institute of Paper Chemistry at Lawrence College. The organization of the Institute has been widely recognized as a progressive and pioneer step. It helps to ground the industry in sound scientific knowledge and to assure trained technicians to bring the benefits of continuing research to the business. This not only makes for sound development within the industry, but enables it more intelligently and adequately to serve the public demand. I congratulate those responsible for bringing the enterprise to the stage signalized by the dedication of the building to serve as a center of your constructive activities.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Ernst Mahler, President, The Institute of Paper Chemistry, Appleton, Wisconsin]
