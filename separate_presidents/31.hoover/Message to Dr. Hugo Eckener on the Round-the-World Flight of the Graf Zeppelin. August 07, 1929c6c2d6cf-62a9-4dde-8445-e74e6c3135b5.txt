Message to Dr. Hugo Eckener on the Round-the-World Flight of the Graf Zeppelin.
I WISH you a successful voyage. The Graf Zeppelin is making a constant contribution to the development of the art of air transportation.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Captain Hugo Eckener, Graf Zeppelin, Lakehurst, New Jersey]
Note: The German dirigible balloon Graf Zeppelin left Lakehurst, N.J., on August 8, 1929, circled the globe, and returned to Lakehurst on August 29. Following the flight, Dr. Eckener was greeted in Washington by the President (see Item 189).
Dr. Eckener's reply to the President's telegram, sent from Lakehurst on August 7, was made public by the White House as follows:
Deeply appreciate your kind wishes. May I, thru you express my profound thanks for the welcome we have received from the American people and the splendid cooperation we have had from the Navy Department which has made these trips possible.
Sincerely,
HUGO ECKENER
[The President, White House]
