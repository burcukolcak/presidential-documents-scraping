[Released October 12, 1929. Dated October 11, 1929]
I CAN NOT too deeply express my appreciation of Your Majesty's kind message and do assure you it was a pleasure to me and my fellow officials to meet the officers of the Japanese training squadron. Permit me to express my congratulations on the splendid showing made by the Japanese midshipmen when reviewed by me.
