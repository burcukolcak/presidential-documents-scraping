The people of Puerto Rico deeply appreciate your cable. Hurricane caused great property damage but was confined to northern half of island especially at eastern end and around San Juan. Latest check late today shows 134 dead and 1,355 injured, believe dead will reach 200. Governor's Committee organized day before hurricane and Red Cross today placed emergency aid in medical supplies, food, and shelter in the regions most seriously damaged. We will need tents and cots from the States. These have already been requested and promised. Representative of National Red Cross scheduled to arrive Friday by air. Entire area affected by hurricane was surveyed from air yesterday and today. Spirit of people excellent. Work of reconstruction started early morning after cyclone. We will need some aid in the way of food for a few weeks.
