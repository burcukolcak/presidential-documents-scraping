I am sure that my Special Ambassador has not failed to express my best wishes to Your Majesty and my confidence that the traditional ties of friendship and mutual understanding which so happily exist between our two countries, as well as the sympathetic cooperation of our peoples, will be further strengthened during Your Majesty's reign.
