Message to King George V of Great Britain Offering Birthday Greetings.
ON THIS auspicious anniversary of Your Majesty's birth, I send you my most friendly greetings.
To the earnest prayers of your loving and loyal subjects for your speedy restoration to health, permit me to add my own and those of [p.175] my fellow countrymen, and may that undaunted courage which has before fortified you be sustained in your present illness.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Majesty King George V, London, England ]
Note: In November 1928, King George V became ill with pneumonia and other respiratory complications which caused him in December to create a Council of State to rule temporarily. In May 1929, he suffered a relapse, and the Council was not dissolved until November 1929.
