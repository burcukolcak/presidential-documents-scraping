Message to President Getulio Vargas on the Inauguration of Airmail Service Between Brazil and the United States.
[Released December 12, 1930. Dated November 22, 1930]
Great and Good Friend:
I am happy to avail of the new link between our countries constituted by the inauguration of an air mail service between them to send to Your Excellency and the people of Brazil my greetings and best wishes for happiness and prosperity.
Each increase in the facilities for communication between our countries brings ever more to our peoples the realization of being brought closer together and so overcomes more and more the barriers of geographical distance and fosters that interchange of ideas and commerce between us which makes the relationship of Governments and peoples mutually beneficial.
Mr. President, allow me to take this opportunity to recall, with the greatest pleasure and appreciation, the most cordial reception and sincere hospitality with which I was received by the Government and people of Brazil in 1928 upon the occasion of my visit to Rio de Janeiro, which will always remain in my memory.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[ Dr. Getulio Vargas, Provisional President of the United States of Brazil ]
