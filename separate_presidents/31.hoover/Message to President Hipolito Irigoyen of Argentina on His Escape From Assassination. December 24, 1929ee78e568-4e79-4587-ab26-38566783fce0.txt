Message to President Hipolito Irigoyen of Argentina on His Escape From Assassination.
I HAVE LEARNED with the utmost concern of the dastardly attempt on your life and desire to express to you my heartiest congratulations on your very fortunate escape. The people of the United States join with those of Argentina in deploring this unfortunate occurrence and in expressing their great relief and joy that you escaped unharmed.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency, President Hipolito Irigoyen, Buenos Aires]
Note: In Buenos Aires, an alleged anarchist fired several shots at the automobile in which President Irigoyen was riding. Other members of the party were injured, but the President escaped unharmed. The assassin was shot to death by police at the scene.
