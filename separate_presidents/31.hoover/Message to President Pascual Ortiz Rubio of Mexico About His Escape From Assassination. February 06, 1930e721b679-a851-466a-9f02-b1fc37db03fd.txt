Message to President Pascual Ortiz Rubio of Mexico About His Escape From Assassination.
WHILE DEEPLY distressed to learn of the cowardly attack made on you and your family Mrs. Hoover and I rejoice with the American people that you and Senora de Ortiz Rubio have suffered no serious harm and that you have been spared to carry on your constructive Program. Please accept our most cordial wishes for your complete recovery and be assured that the Government of the United States earnestly trusts that Mexico, under your wise and able guidance, will enjoy an era of spiritual and economic progress.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency Pascual Ortiz Rubio, President of Mexico]
Note: Two hours after taking the oath of office on February 5, 1930, President Rubio was wounded in the cheek and jaw by a series of shots fired by Daniel Flores from a group of spectators.
