Message to President Paul Doumer of France About an Assassination Attempt.
THE INTELLIGENCE of the attempt upon Your Excellency's life at the hands of a dastardly assassin shocks and saddens me. My fellow countrymen join with me in silent prayer for a speedy recovery that your life may be spared for many years to the country which you have served with such loyalty and zeal.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency Paul Doumer, President of the French Republic, Paris, France]
Note: On May 6, 1932, Paul Gorguloff, a Russian emigre, shot the French President. M. Doumer died of his wounds on May 7.
