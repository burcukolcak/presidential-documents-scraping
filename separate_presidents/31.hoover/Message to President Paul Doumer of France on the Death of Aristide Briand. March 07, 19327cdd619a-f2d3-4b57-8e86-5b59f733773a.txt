Message to President Paul Doumer of France on the Death of Aristide Briand.
I DESIRE to express to you, Mr. President, my sincere and deep sympathy and that of the people of the United States on the death of that great son of France and friend of the United States, Aristide Briand. His loyal and unflinching fight for peace, both in Europe and in this country, endeared him to the American people who mourn his loss with you.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency Paul Doumer, President of the French Republic, Paris, France]
Note: M. Briand had held 25 ministerial posts, serving as Premier of France 11 times, and as Minister of Foreign Affairs from July 1926 until January 1932.
