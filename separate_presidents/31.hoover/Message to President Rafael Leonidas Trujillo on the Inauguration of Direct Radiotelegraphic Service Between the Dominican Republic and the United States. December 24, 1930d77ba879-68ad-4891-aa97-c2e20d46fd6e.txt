Message to President Rafael Leonidas Trujillo on the Inauguration of Direct Radiotelegraphic Service Between the Dominican Republic and the United States.
[Released December 24, 1930. Dated December 23, 1930]
THE NEW LINK between our countries inaugurated today by the opening of a direct radio-telegraphic service between Santo Domingo and the United States affords me an opportunity to extend to Your Excellency and the Dominican people my greetings and my sincere good wishes for the new year.
It is a matter of deep gratification that every increase in the facilities of communication between our countries draws them nearer together, fostering the growth of cultural and commercial relations between them and further strengthening their mutual friendship.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, President of the Dominican Republic, Santo Domingo]
