Message to President Thomas G. Masaryk on the Inauguration of Direct Radiotelegraphic Service Between Czechoslovakia and the United States.
I AM HAPPY to avail myself of the new link between our countries which is afforded by the opening today of direct radiotelegraphic service to send my best wishes for Your Excellency's health and happiness as well as for the prosperity of the people of Czechoslovakia. All improvements in the facilities of communication between our countries happily tend to overcome the barriers imposed by geographical distance between them and to bring our Governments and peoples more closely together.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency T. G. Masaryk, President of Czechoslovakia, Prague]
