My dear Mr. Stout:
Benjamin Franklin's creative mind, world outlook, ardent patriotism, and achievements as a scientist and statesman, have made his memory and influence the heritage of all men. I am confident that the meeting of the International Benjamin Franklin Society will reveal anew the greatness of his character and service.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
