Message to The International Benjamin Franklin Society.
[Released January 21, 1933. Dated January 19, 1933]
My dear Mr. Stout:
The world today more than ever needs the breadth of vision and the wisdom so conspicuously exemplified in the life of Benjamin Franklin. I shall hope that the meeting of the International Benjamin Franklin Society may be helpful in the development of such an attitude.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. J. Robert Stout, President, The International Benjamin Franklin Society, 2305 Woolworth Building, New York City]
Note: The message was read at the society's 10th annual luncheon, held at the Hotel Plaza in New York City.
