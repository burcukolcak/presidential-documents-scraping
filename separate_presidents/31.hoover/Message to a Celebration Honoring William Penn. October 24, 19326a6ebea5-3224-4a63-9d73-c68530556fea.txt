Message to a Celebration Honoring William Penn.
[Released October 24, 1932. Dated October 18, 1932]
My dear Mr. Mayor:
I regret that earlier commitments make it impossible for me to attend the celebration in Philadelphia of the 250th Anniversary of William Penn. The influence of his benevolent spirit and his idealistic faith has grown with time, and has been a potent force for peace, right dealing and progress in the State which he rounded. I share in spirit the reverence being paid to his memory, and I ask you to greet for me all those who take part in this observance.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable J. Hampton Moore, Mayor, Philadelphia, Pa.]
Note: The message was read by Charles F. Jenkins, chairman of the executive committee of the William Penn Commemoration Committee, during exercises held in Convention Hall in Philadelphia, Pa., commemorating the anniversary of William Penn's landing on American shores.
