My dear Mr. Wiley:
I am glad to learn that the Steuben County Society, of New York, plans to pay appropriate honor to the Honorable Alanson B. Houghton at its forthcoming annual dinner. Mr. Houghton's service as Ambassador to Germany and to the Court of St. James was a genuine contribution to the furtherance of international understanding and good will. His work as a distinguished and able representative of his country in diplomatic councils deserves the thanks of his countrymen.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
