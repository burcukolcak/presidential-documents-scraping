I WILL BE obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to those present at the dinner in honor of Dr. James H. Kimball tomorrow evening, and to Dr. Kimball himself my warm appreciation of his signal services in promoting the success of aviation in general and transatlantic flights in particular through his scientific skill and judgment so characteristic of the entire weather forecasting service of our country.
