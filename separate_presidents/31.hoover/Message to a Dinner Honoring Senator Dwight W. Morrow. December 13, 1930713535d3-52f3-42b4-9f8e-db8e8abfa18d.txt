Message to a Dinner Honoring Senator Dwight W. Morrow.
I WILL BE obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to those present at the dinner to Senator Morrow in New York this evening and also my deep sense of the great value of his work in improving the prison system of New Jersey, this being one of the outstanding contributions to prison administration made in this country which assisted in a sound background for the eight measures of reform of Federal prisons which we were able to enact in the last session of Congress, now placing the Federal Government to the forefront in these matters.

Note: The message, sent to Ogden H. Hammond, National Prison Emergency Committee, 250 West 57th Street, New York City, was read at a dinner at the Hotel Pierre in New York honoring Senator-elect Morrow for his pioneer work in developing the Morrow plan of prison reform.
As first set forth by the Morrow Commission in 1918, the plan called for a system of prisoner classification, for new construction adapted to differing for new prison farms and industries to provide useful work, and for the ton of prison products so as not to compete with the products of free labor. For Federal prison reforms to which the President referred, see Item 163.
