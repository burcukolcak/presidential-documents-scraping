Message to a Dinner of the American Institute.
I WILL BE obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to those present at the dinner of the American Institute on Thursday evening. It is distinctly worthwhile to remind the public not only that many great industrial enterprises are based upon the technical and mechanical requirements of the Army and Navy but also that many inventions and new processes of the greatest value to mankind are the outgrowth of researches undertaken in behalf of these national establishments.

[A. Cressy Morrison, President, The American Institute, Fisk Building, Broadway at 57th Street, New York City]
Note: The message was read at a dinner held in the Hotel Astor in New York City.
