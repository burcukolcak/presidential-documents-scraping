Message to a Testimonial Dinner Honoring Dr. James Ewing.
[Released January 31, 1931. Dated January 29, 1931]
Gentlemen:
I thank you warmly for your kind invitation to attend the testimonial dinner in honor of Dr. James Ewing on January 31st, and deeply regret that my duties here do not permit me to be present. I should like to share in person in paying honor to such a useful and distinguished citizen, whose work as scientific researcher, teacher, and author has done so much to forward the attack upon the problem of cancer in particular and of disease in general. Such a career is a service and an inspiration to humanity, and deserves the tribute of public praise.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Medical Board of the Memorial Hospital, New York, N.Y.]
Note: The message was read at a testimonial dinner, held at the Hotel Pierre in New York City. Dr. Ewing, of Cornell University, was one of the Nation's leading cancer researchers.
