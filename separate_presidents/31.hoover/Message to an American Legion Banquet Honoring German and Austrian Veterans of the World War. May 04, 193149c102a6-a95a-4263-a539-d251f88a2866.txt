Message to an American Legion Banquet Honoring German and Austrian Veterans of the World War.
I AM GLAD to learn that the American Legion is taking the initiative in wiping out the animosities of the War by so gallant an action in good will as the Dinner you are giving this evening for the men who served in the German armed forces and who are now prospective citizens of our own Republic.
