Message to the 27th National Saengerfest in New York City.
My dear Dr. Ewald:
Americans of German blood have contributed to American cultural life in so many directions that it would be invidious to place one of their contributions above another in any scale of values, but in none perhaps has their service been greater than in the field of music. The choral singing that is so distinctively an institution of the race and that has been continued here with undiminished enthusiasm and success is a very positive as well as very delightful addition to the cultural inspirations of this country. I am glad to welcome the twenty-seventh National Saengerfest to be held this evening at Madison Square Garden in New York.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
