Message to the American Road Builders Association.
I SHALL BE OBLIGED if you will present my cordial greetings to the annual convention of the American Road Builders Association, which is rendering an important public service, not only in extending the highway system of the country but in connection with an increased road building program as a means of employment. In the period from January nineteen hundred thirty to the end of the current fiscal year the Federal Government is expending over four hundred thirty-nine million dollars for highway building as a part of its total expenditures of more than one billion, five hundred fifty-five million dollars for construction and maintenance in aid of unemployment since the depression began. Road building by the Federal Government and the States and municipalities is a major factor in unemployment relief. Your Association has performed a very useful function in coordinating engineering, manufacturing, equipment and industrial aspects of the program. I trust that your convention may be fruitful in sound plans and policies of such an important factor, both of relief and recovery.
