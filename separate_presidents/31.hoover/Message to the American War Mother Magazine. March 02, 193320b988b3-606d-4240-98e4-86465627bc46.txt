My dear Mrs. McClure:
Probably more than any other man in public life, I have had reason to know at first hand the magnificent response made by American mothers during the war period. Their courage, fortitude, energy and cooperation, were of decisive inspiration and practical helpfulness. Theirs was an indispensable service, nobly rendered, and deserving of the undying gratitude of the nation.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
