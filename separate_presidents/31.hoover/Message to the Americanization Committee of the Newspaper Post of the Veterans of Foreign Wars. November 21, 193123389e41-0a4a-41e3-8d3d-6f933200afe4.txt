Message to the Americanization Committee of the Newspaper Post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
[Released November 21, 1931. Dated November 18, 1931]
Dear Colonel Grove:
I wish to emphasize the significance of the Americanization program under the auspices of the Newspaper Post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. The purpose of this meeting, I am advised, is to explain to newly naturalized citizens the value of the heritage they are acquiring in becoming citizens of the United States.
There is no more sacred obligation among citizens of the United States today than to be awake to the duties of citizenship. Good citizenship connotes love of country and reverence for its laws; recognition of civic duties and defense of country in time of emergency; proper respect for the rights and property of others; and consideration for the feelings of our fellowmen. Such a spirit of good citizenship, of patriotism and unselfishness was exemplified by the membership of your organization in the conflicts in which our country was involved. It is equally important that these responsibilities be recognized in time of peace, and no less than in time of war should all citizens be worthy examples in the duties of citizenship to those newly assuming those duties.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Colonel Walter E. Grove, Commander, The Americanization Committee of the Newspaper Post, No. 1955, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, 216 West 50th Street, New York City]
