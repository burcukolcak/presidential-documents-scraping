Message to the Annual Convention of the Advertising Federation of America.
[Released June 15, 1931. Dated May 11, 1931]
Gentlemen:
It seems to me most appropriate that at your annual convention you Propose to clarify the function of advertising as an economic force, so that its benefits may be better understood not only by those who employ it, but by the public to which in the aggregate it renders its greatest service.
Advertising has played .an important part in raising our standard of living, in stimulating invention and in maintaining competition. By promoting production and distribution, it has brought within the reach of the many comforts and conveniences previously enjoyed by the few.
The theme of your convention is especially timely, because of the part sound, constructive advertising is bound to play in accelerating the return of normal business activity.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Advertising Federation of America, 420 Lexington Avenue, New York City]
