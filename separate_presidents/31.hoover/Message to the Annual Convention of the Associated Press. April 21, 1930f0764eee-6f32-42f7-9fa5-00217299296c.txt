Message to the Annual Convention of the Associated Press.
I WOULD appreciate it greatly if you would extend my greetings to the annual meeting of the Associated Press. It is a great institution which daily renders intellectual service to the American people with that fine impartiality and reliability that have given it high distinction.
It is a marvelous advancement of science that enables you to listen to an address from London by Secretary Stimson. The work of Secretary Stimson and his colleagues at the conference has been carefully and fully transmitted over the wires of the Associated Press day by day for the past four months and thereby the American people have gained an appreciation of the problems which the conference has undertaken to solve and the difficulties they have met and the success that has resulted. Their achievement marks another great step in the maintenance of peace. Only the utmost courage and tenacity of the eminent men comprising all the delegations at London could have brought to so difficult a problem a solution fruitful of so many blessings. The Associated Press and other press representatives have contributed materially, for such negotiation in those times is not alone the work of the delegations. It must be responsive to national instinct and national aspiration. Peace is fundamentally a state of mind and a resolve of will of the whole people. Therefore the fidelity of the press representatives in reporting the course of the conference has played a large part in its success by giving all of our people an instant and comprehensive knowledge of the facts, and thus enabling the nation itself to share in these negotiations.

I wish to compliment the A.P. on the service it has rendered.
HERBERT HOOVER
