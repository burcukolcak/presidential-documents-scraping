Message to the Annual Convention of the Atlantic Deeper Waterways Association.
[Released October 7, 1931. Dated October 3, 1931]
My dear Mr. Moore:
Transportation facilities adequate for current requirements are an essential clement of national progress. The annual convention of the Atlantic Deeper Waterways Association in Boston deals with an essential aspect of the national problem, and your deliberations are important both to commerce and to national defense. The association is to be commended for its efforts in stimulating waterway construction as a measure of unemployment relief. I trust that your deliberations may be fruitful in the formulation and execution of helpful policies, and shall appreciate it if you will present my cordial greetings and good wishes to the delegates.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. J. Hampton Moore, President, Atlantic Deeper Waterways Association, 1405 Widener Building, Philadelphia, Pa.]
Note: The message was read to the association's 24th annual convention in Boston, Mass.
