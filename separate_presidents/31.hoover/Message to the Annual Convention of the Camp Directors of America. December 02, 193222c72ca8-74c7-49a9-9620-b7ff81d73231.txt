Message to the Annual Convention of the Camp Directors of America.
[Released December 2, 1932. Dated November 30, 1932]
My dear Mr. Arnold:
I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the Annual Convention of the Camp Directors of America, and every good wish for a successful and inspiring conference. Camping occupies so important a place in the life of American youth that it is difficult to overestimate the value of the service of the Camp Directors in embodying to the boys and girls the high ideals of sportsmanship, cooperation and helpfulness which appeal so strongly to the youthful imagination, and consequently have so powerful an influence in shaping character.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Wallace Greene Arnold, President, New York Section, Camp Directors Association of America, Room 3401--551 Fifth Ave., New York City]
Note: The message was read at the association's convention dinner which was held at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City.
