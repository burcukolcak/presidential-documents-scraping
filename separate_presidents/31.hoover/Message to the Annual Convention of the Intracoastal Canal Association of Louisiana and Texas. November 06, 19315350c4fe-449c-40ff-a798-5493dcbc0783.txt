Message to the Annual Convention of the Intracoastal Canal Association of Louisiana and Texas.
[Released November 6, 1931. Dated November 5, 1931 ]
PLEASE PRESENT my cordial greetings to the citizens of Louisiana and Texas attending the annual convention of the Intracoastal Canal Association celebrating the early completion of the waterway from Mississippi to Corpus Christi. The ultimate extension of this waterway to the Rio Grande and the Mexican border would bring important benefits to the Southwest. I trust that your convention may give impetus to the development of inland waterways and a coordinated system of transportation.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Roy Miller, Vice President, Intracoastal Canal Association of Louisiana & Texas, Corpus Christi, Texas]
Note: The message was read at the opening session of the association's 27th annual convention, which met in Corpus Christi, Tex.
