Herbert Hoover
April 21, 1930

Message to the Annual Convention of the United Press Association.
PLEASE present my greetings to the members of the United Press gathered in annual convention and convey to them my appreciation of the valuable service which they hourly perform in distribution of public information. I should like to emphasize the great contribution your service has given for the advancement of good will in our relations with our sister republics to the south. By the enlargement of your news services you have contributed to better understanding not by preachments but by the daily illustration of the wholesome side of our national life. You have stimulated commercial relations with more ample commercial service. It is, therefore, most appropriate that your guest of honor should be His Excellency the President-elect of Colombia who so ably represented his country in Washington, and I would be pleased if you would convey my compliments to him.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Karl Bickel, President, United Press Association, World Building, New York City]
Note: Mr. Bickel read the message at a dinner honoring President-elect EnriqueOlaya of Colombia. The convention of the United Press Association was held in New York City.
