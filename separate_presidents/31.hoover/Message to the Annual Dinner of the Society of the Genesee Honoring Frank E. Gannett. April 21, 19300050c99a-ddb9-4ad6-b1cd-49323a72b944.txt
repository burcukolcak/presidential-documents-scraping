[Released April 21, 1930. Dated March 27, 1930]
My dear Mr. Wiley:
I am happy to extend cordial greetings to the Society of the Genesee on the occasion of its thirty-first annual dinner and to send my best wishes to your guest of honor Mr. Frank E. Gannett.
The publication of accurate, unbiased, worthwhile news is a public service; for our people rely for information of affairs upon the newspapers. Mr. Gannett has shown a high sense of public responsibility in the management of his newspapers. I congratulate him upon his many achievements and wish your Society many more such pleasant gatherings.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
