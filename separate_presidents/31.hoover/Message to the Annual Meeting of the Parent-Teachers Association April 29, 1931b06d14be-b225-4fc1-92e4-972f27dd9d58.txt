Message to the Annual Meeting of the Parent-Teachers Association
[Released July 1931. Dated April 29, 1931 ]
My dear Mrs. Bradford:
I am deeply gratified that the annual meeting of the Parent-Teachers Association will this year have for its central theme the challenge of The Children's Charter which the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection crystallized as a working program for constructive new efforts in behalf of American childhood. Your organization is ideally constituted to render most important service in furtherance of these aspirations for a better life for the children, and I deeply appreciate their cooperation.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Hugh Bradford, President, Parent-Teacher Association, Hot Springs, Arkansas]
