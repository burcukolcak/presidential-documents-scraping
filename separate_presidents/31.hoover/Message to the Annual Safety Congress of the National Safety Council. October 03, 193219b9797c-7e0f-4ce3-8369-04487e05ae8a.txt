Message to the Annual Safety Congress of the National Safety Council.
My dear Mr. Bergquist:
I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the Annual Safety Congress of the National Safety Council, and my deep sense of the value of their leadership in the vital tasks of saving human life from the avoidable accidents incident to modern machinery of production and transportation. This work is both wise conservation and high humanity.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
