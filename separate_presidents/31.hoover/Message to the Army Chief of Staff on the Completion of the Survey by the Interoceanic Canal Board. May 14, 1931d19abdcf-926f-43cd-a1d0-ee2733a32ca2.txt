Message to the Army Chief of Staff on the Completion of the Survey by the Interoceanic Canal Board.
My dear General MacArthur:
I am much gratified with the conduct of the survey of the route for an Interoceanic canal across the Republic of Nicaragua which the Army Engineer Battalion is bringing to a successful conclusion. For a year and a half the officers and enlisted men of the Battalion have toiled in the tropical jungle in the accomplishment of this task. Their work has been done, not for financial reward, but in that willing and faithful performance of duty which is the tradition of the Army, in peace and in war. I should be pleased to have you convey to these troops my appreciation of their devoted service.
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Chief of Staff, War Department]
Note: On December 10, 1931, the President transmitted the report of the Interoceanic Canal Board to the Congress. The report is printed in House Document 139 (72d Cong., 3d sess.).
