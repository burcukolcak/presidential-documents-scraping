Message to the Association of Community Chests and Councils About the Red Cross Drought Relief Campaign.
I WISH to express my gratification at the action of the Community Chest Association in giving such whole-hearted support to the appeal of the Red Cross in this emergency. It exemplifies the response which the country will unquestionably give.
