Message to the Biblical Seminary.
THE NEED in the United States and throughout the world for trained and effective religious leadership must appear to all thoughtful citizens as not less but greater today than in ordinary times.
I am therefore happy to express my sincere wish that the Biblical Seminary in New York have the support for which you and your coworkers are now asking and that it shall continue its interdenominational work of training Bible inspired preachers, teachers, missionaries and other Christian workers.
No institution doing the work this Seminary is doing should be allowed to fail, particularly in times like these.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Dr. John H. Finley, The New York Times, New York City]
