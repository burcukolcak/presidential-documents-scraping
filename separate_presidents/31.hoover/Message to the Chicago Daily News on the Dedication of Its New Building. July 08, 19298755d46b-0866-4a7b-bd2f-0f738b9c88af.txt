Message to the Chicago Daily News on the Dedication of Its New Building.
[Released July 8, 1929. Dated July 5, 1929]
I CONGRATULATE the Chicago Daily News on its splendid new building and the fifty-four years of distinguished public service which has made it possible. I congratulate Chicago on the fact that one of its great institutions has made such an important contribution to the beauty of the city and by establishing the principle of air rights construction opened the way to a greater development of its business and commercial resources.
I cordially extend my best wishes to the Chicago Daily News and its management. I hope that with the finer facilities of its new home and equipment, the Daily News will continue to be a leader of public enterprises and a moulder of sound public opinion valuable alike to its community and the nation.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message was sent to Walter A. Strong, publisher, Chicago Daily News, Chicago, Ill., and was read at the dedication ceremony by Secretary of Commerce Robert P. Lamont.
The Daily News Building was built over the Chicago and Northwestern railroad yards. The President started the new presses by pushing a button in Washington, D.C.
