Message to the Children's Hour.
[Released May 30, 1931. Dated May 28, 1931]
My dear Mr. Warner:
I am interested to know of your weekly broadcast of a children's hour, and particularly of your program for Memorial Day.
The White House Conference on Child Health and Protection recognizes the rights of the child as the first rights of citizenship. The Children's Charter, which it promulgated, sets forth the aspirations and objectives of those who are seeking the protection and the rounded development of the children of America.
I enclose a copy of the Children's Charter, which states succinctly the rights of children, regardless of race or color or situation, wherever they may live under the protection of the American flag.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Henry Edward Warner, c/o The Baltimore Sun, Baltimore, Md.]
Note: The letter and the Children's Charter were read as the opening feature of the Children's Hour, a program originating from WCAO radio in Baltimore, Md.
