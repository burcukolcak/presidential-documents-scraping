Message to the Colorado Conference on Child Health and Protection.
My dear Governor Adams:
I shall appreciate it if you will present my cordial greetings to the Colorado White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. It is most gratifying to see such interest in acquainting officials and citizens with the findings of the nation-wide study and the Conference in Washington, and effective efforts to translate the principles of the Children's Charter into practice. The realization of these ideals would contribute greatly to the health and well-being of the children of Colorado, and I trust that your Conference will be fruitful of inspiration and practical effect.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. William H. Adams, Governor of Colorado, Denver, Colorado]
