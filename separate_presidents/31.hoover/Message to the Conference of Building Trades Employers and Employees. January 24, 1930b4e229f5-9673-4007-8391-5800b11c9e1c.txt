Message to the Conference of Building Trades Employers and Employees.
[Released January 24, 1930. Dated January 8, 1930]
Gentlemen:
I have been asked if, in view of the momentous importance of the conference you are about to undertake, I would address to you a word of kindly encouragement. I am glad to do so.
To find a method for the amiable settlement of jurisdictional disputes is indeed one of the most important questions in our labor relations. It is capable of solution. Failure to solve it results in losses to labor, to employers and to the public at large. It is evidence of the advancing understanding of the whole of our social and economic problems that this conference should take place, and I am indeed glad to wish success to your endeavors.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message was read into the record during a joint conference of the Building Trades Department--AFL and the Building Trades Employers' Association. The conference was held in Tampa, Fla.
