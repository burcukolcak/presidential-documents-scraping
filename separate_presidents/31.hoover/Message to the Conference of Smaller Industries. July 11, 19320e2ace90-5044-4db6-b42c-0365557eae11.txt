Message to the Conference of Smaller Industries.
[Released July 11, 1932. Dated July 6, 1932]
My dear Mr. Young:
I am glad to learn that the highly successful Conference on Management Problems of the Smaller Industries that was held last year is to be followed up this year by a similar Conference next week. It would be difficult to overstate the value of these smaller industries in the economic life of the Nation, providing as they do the bulk of the most varied manufactured products of the country and contributing to the most intensive development of local resources in every region. They are also vitally important in the human sense for they employ more than half of the industrial labor in the United States, and their problems of employee relations therefore affect the well-being of this great element of our population. I will be obliged if you will express to those gathered for this Conference my cordial greetings and my hearty good wishes for a meeting helpful to them and to those dependent upon them for the opportunity to earn their livelihood.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
