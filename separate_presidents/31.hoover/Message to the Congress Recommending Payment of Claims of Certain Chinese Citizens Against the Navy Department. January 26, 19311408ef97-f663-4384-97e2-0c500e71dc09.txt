Message to the Congress Recommending Payment of Claims of Certain Chinese Citizens Against the Navy Department.
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State requesting the submission to the Congress of claims against the Navy Department in the total amount of $4,657.20 United States currency in behalf of Yao Ah-Ken and Chiang Ah-erh (Tsiange Ah Erh) for personal injuries received; the family of Ts'ao Jung-k'uan (Dzao Yong Kwer) for damages sustained due to his death; and in behalf of the Shanghai Electric Construction Co. (Ltd.) for property losses sustained by it as the result of a collision between United States Marine Corps truck No. 1130 and tram car B 168, owned by the company, in Shanghai, China, on November 29, 1929. The total amount requested to be appropriated will be allotted as follows: To Yao Ah-Ken and Chiang Ah-erh (Tsiange Ah Erh), $1,500 each; to the family of Ts'ao Jung-k'uan (Dzao Yong Kwer), $1,500; and to the Shanghai Electric Construction Co. (Ltd.), $157.20.
I recommend that, as an act of grace and without reference to the question of the legal liability of the United States in the premises, an appropriation in the total amount of $4,657.20 United States currency be authorized to effect settlement of these claims, in accordance with the recommendations of the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of State.
