Message to the Congress Recommending Payment of a Claim Presented by the Government of Great Britain.
To the Congress of the United States:
I inclose a report received from the Secretary of State requesting the submission anew to the present Congress of the claim presented by the Government of Great Britain on behalf of Mr. H. W. Bennett, a British subject, against the United States for reimbursement on account of losses sustained in connection with the rescue of survivors of the U.S.S. Cherokee, in February, 1919.
I concur in the recommendation made by the Secretary of State and recommend that, as an act of grace and without reference to the question of the legal liability of the United States in the matter, the Congress authorize an appropriation in the sum of $253.50 in order to effect a settlement of this claim.
