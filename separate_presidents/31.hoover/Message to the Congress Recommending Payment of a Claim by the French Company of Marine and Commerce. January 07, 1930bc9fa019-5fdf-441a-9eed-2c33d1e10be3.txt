Message to the Congress Recommending Payment of a Claim by the French Company of Marine and Commerce.
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State in regard to the remission of a fine imposed on the sailing vessel France owned by the French Company of Marine and Commerce by the immigration authorities on the occasion of the vessel's arrival at Baltimore on July 23, 1920. The fine was imposed because the captain of the France submitted a crew list in a form which failed to contain certain data required by section 36 of the immigration act of February 5, 1917. The Secretary of State is of the opinion that the failure of the captain to include this information was not due to any fault of his but was due to the fact that when he called at the American consulate at Nantes and requested to be furnished with the copies of the regular forms none were available, and he was accordingly obliged to make out his list on ordinary paper. The conclusion reached by the Secretary of State has my approval, and I recommend that the Congress authorize an appropriation of $530 to be paid to the French Company of Marine and Commerce.
