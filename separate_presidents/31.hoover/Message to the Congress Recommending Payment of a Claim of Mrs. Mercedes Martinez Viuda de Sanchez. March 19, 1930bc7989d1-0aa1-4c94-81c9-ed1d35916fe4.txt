Message to the Congress Recommending Payment of a Claim of Mrs. Mercedes Martinez Viuda de Sanchez.
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith a report regarding the request of Mrs. Mercedes Martinez Viuda de Sanchez, widow of Emeterio Sanchez, for an award which will enable her to be provided with the necessities of life.
I recommend in accordance with the suggestion of the Acting Secretary of State that the Congress, as an act of grace and without reference to the legal liability of the United States in the matter, authorize an appropriation for $500, to be paid to Mrs. Sanchez as a recognition of the meritorious services rendered by her deceased husband in rescuing certain American seamen and to relieve to a certain extent her present financial condition.
