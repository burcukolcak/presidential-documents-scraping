Message to the Congress Recommending an Appropriation To Refund Fees Collected for Visas.
To the Congress of the United States:
I inclose a report received from the Secretary of State concerning certain claims against the United States for the refund of the fees collected for visas issued under the laws in force prior to July 1, 1924, which were rendered worthless by the enactment of the immigration act of 1924. The report requests that the Congress authorize the appropriation of the sum necessary to refund the fees referred to.
I concur in the recommendation of the Secretary of State and recommend that the Congress authorize an appropriation in the sum of $160,000, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to effect the settlement of these claims
