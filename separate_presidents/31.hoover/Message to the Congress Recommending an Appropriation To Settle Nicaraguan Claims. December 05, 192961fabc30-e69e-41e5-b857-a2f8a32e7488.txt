Message to the Congress Recommending an Appropriation To Settle Nicaraguan Claims.
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith a report respecting claims against the United States on account of several Nicaraguans killed or injured in encounters with American marines in December, 1921, and January, 1922, with a request that the recommendations of the Secretary of the Navy as indicated therein be adopted, and that the Congress authorize the appropriation of the sum necessary to pay the indemnities suggested by the Secretary of the Navy.
I recommend that, in order to effect a settlement of these claims in accordance with the recommendation of the Secretary of State, the Congress, as an act of grace, and without reference to the legal liability of the United States in the premises, authorize an appropriation in the sum of $11,700.
