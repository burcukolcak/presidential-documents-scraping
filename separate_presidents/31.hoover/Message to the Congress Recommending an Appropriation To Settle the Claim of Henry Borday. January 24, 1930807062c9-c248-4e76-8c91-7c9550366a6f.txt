Message to the Congress Recommending an Appropriation To Settle the Claim of Henry Borday.
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith a report concerning the claim of Mr. Henry Borday, a French citizen, against the United States for indemnity on account of injuries received when he was assaulted at his place of business at Port au Prince, Haiti, by two United States marines about October 3, 1916, with a request that the recommendations of the Secretary of State as indicated therein be adopted and that the Congress authorize the appropriation of the sum necessary to pay the indemnities suggested by the Secretary of State.
I recommend that in order to effect a settlement of this claim in accordance with the recommendation of the Secretary of State the Congress, as an act of grace and without reference to the legal liability of the United States in the premises authorize an appropriation in the sum of $1,000, with simple interest at 6 per cent from October 3, 1916, until the date of payment.
