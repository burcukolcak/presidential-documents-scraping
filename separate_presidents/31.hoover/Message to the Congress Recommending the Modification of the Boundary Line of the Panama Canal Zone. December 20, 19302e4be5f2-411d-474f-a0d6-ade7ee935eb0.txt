Message to the Congress Recommending the Modification of the Boundary Line of the Panama Canal Zone.
To the Congress of the United States:
I enclose a communication from the Secretary of State recommending a modification of the boundary line between the Panama Canal Zone and the Republic of Panama, so far as it affects that parcel of land in the Panama Canal Zone known as the Paitilla Point Military Reservation.
I recommend that the Congress enact the necessary legislation authorizing and empowering the Secretary of State to effect the modification of the boundary line as recommended by him.
