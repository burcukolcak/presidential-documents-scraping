In compliance with the provisions of the act of March 3, 1915, establishing the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, I submit herewith the sixteenth annual report of the committee for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1930.
Attention is invited to the opening portion of the committee's report dealing with the aeronautical situation generally, and also to Part V of the report presenting a summary of progress in the technical development of aircraft. It is gratifying to note therein, and in Chairman Ames's letter of transmittal, the committee's views as to the factors that have contributed to and assure the further progress of aeronautics.
I concur with the committee's recommendations at the end of the report regarding the further development of aircraft and the need for continued prosecution of scientific research in aeronautics.
