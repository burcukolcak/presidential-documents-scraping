Message to the Congress Transmitting the Report of the Porto Rican Hurricane Relief Commission.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am submitting herewith for your consideration a copy of the report of the Porto Rican Hurricane Relief Commission recommending that additional funds be made available to the Commission for the purposes specified therein. I am also submitting a draft of the legislation proposed by the Commission to accomplish these purposes.
Porto Rico is still suffering from the effects of the disastrous hurricane of September 13, 1928. There exists a real and immediate need for appropriating these funds in order to alleviate the distress due to unemployment on the Island and to enable the Commission to continue its farm rehabilitation program.
The proposed legislation has my approval and I recommend its immediate enactment.
HERBERT HOOVER

THE WHITE HOUSE,

January 14, 1930.
Note: The message and accompanying report are printed as House Document 254 (71st Cong., 2d sess.).
The report recommended an additional $3 million, including $2 million for roads and schools and $1 million to be applied to an existing $6 million loan fund for Porto Rican planters. A resolution authorizing the appropriation (Public Res. 33) became law on January 24, 1930, but the appropriation was later defeated in the House of Representatives.
