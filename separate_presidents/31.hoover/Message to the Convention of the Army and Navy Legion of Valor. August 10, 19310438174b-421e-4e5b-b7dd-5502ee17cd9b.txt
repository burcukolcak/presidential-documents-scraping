Message to the Convention of the Army and Navy Legion of Valor.
[Released August 10, 1931. Dated August 3, 1931]
My dear Major Cooper:
On the occasion of the Memorial Service of the Army and Navy Legion of Valor of the United States of America, I wish to extend on behalf of the nation cordial congratulations and good wishes, and to express sympathetic interest in the objectives of the organization. To cherish the memories of the valiant, to stimulate patriotism in the minds of youth and to inculcate respect for the flag, are aims which strike a responsive chord in the heart of all good citizens. I trust that your ceremonies on August 9th may contribute to the greater realization of your sound ideals.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Major Edwin H. Cooper, D.S.C., Chief of Staff, Army and Navy Legion of Valor, 11 Glastonbury Oval, Waban, Mass.]
