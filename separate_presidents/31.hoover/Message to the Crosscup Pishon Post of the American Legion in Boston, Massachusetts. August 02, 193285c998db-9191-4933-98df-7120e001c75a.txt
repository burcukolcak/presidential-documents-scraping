Message to the Crosscup Pishon Post of the American Legion in Boston, Massachusetts.
[Released August 2, 1932. Dated July 29, 1932]
My dear Commander Edwards:

That was a most encouraging telegram you sent me this morning.
I would be glad if the veterans throughout the country could know the character of the men claiming to be their representatives who have been in Washington since the adjournment of Congress. It is the impression of our government services that less than half of them ever served under the American flag.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Edward C. Edwards, Commander, Crosscup Pishon Post, American Legion, Boston, Mass.]
Note: The message was in response to a telegram from the Crosscup Pishon Post, dated July 29, 1932. A text of the telegram follows:
The Crosscup Pishon Post, American Legion of Boston, Massachusetts endorses the action you have taken regarding the so-called bonus army. We know that the action of this group has neither the support, the sympathy, nor the respect of the true veterans of this country.
EDWARD C. EDWARDS
Commander
[Herbert Hoover, President of the United States, Washington ]
