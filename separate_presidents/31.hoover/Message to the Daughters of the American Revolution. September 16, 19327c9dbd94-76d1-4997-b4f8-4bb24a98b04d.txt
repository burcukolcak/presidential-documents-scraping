Message to the Daughters of the American Revolution.
[Released September 16, 1932. Dated September 15, 1932]
My dear Mrs. Magna:
I will be glad if you will make public in the way you deem most fitting and serviceable my profound appreciation of the patriotic service of the Daughters of the American Revolution in rescuing from oblivion the names of the heroic Frenchmen who at Yorktown so gallantly aided our forefathers in sealing the success of the cause of American independence. The Pilgrimage to Paris for the purpose of dedicating a bronze tablet bearing these names, upon the 151st anniversary of the Battle of Yorktown, is a splendid gesture of appreciation, certain to promote an historic international friendship and coming with especial appropriateness from your great group of patriotic American women.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Russell William Magna, President General, National Society, Daughters of the American Revolution, Memorial Continental Hall, Washington, D.C.]
Note: The message was made public in conjunction with publicity about the group's planned pilgrimage to Paris.
