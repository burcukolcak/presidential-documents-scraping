Message to the Dedication Ceremonies for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
THE NATION will linger today in its annual tribute of reverent memory of the glorious youth who gave their lives to defend our heritage of liberty and will pay a special homage in the dedication of the completed tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Its beauty is the symbol of our national pride in their heroism; our gratitude for their supreme devotion.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message was read at Armistice Day ceremonies dedicating the completed tomb in Arlington National Cemetery.
