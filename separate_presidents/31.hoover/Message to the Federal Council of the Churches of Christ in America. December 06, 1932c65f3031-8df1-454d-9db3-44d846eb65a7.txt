Message to the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America.
My dear Bishop McDowell:
I deeply appreciate your cordial invitation to deliver a radio message on the occasion of the meeting of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America in Indianapolis December 6. I deeply regret that the pressure of public business connected with the opening of the session of the Congress makes it impossible for me to command the time for such a service.
I will be obliged if you will convey to the meeting the assurance of my very high regard for the Federal Council and its purposes in our life. I especially appreciate and commend the wise and hearty cooperation on the part of the churches in the promotion of social service, better relations and the creation of that spiritual and ethical tone so absolutely essential to our life as a people.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message was sent to Bishop William F. McDowell, chairman of the Washington, D.C., committee of the council, and was made public in conjunction with the organization's quadrennial meeting.
