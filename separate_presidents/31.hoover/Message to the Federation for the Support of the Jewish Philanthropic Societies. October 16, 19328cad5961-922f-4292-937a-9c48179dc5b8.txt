[Released October 16, 1932. Dated October 15, 1932]
IN A YEAR when all privately supported philanthropy is being put to the most severe test the success of Jewish federations appeal for funds is doubly important. Your notable achievements in years past give me confidence that your community will again respond to your call.
I wish you every success.
