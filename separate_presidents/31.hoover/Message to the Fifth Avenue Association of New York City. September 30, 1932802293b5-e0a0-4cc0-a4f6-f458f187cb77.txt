My dear Mr. Pedrick:
The Fifth Avenue Week movement for the revival of business through pledging of allegiance by stores to quality merchandise and to the highest business standards, deserves every encouragement and the emulation of other communities throughout the country. I send you my hearty good wishes for all possible success.

Yours faithfully,
