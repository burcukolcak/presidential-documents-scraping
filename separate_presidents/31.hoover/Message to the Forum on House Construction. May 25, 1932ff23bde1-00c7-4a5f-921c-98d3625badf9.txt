Message to the Forum on House Construction.
[Released May 25, 1932. Dated May 20, 1932]
My dear Mr. Foster:
I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the Forum on House Construction and my appreciation of the value of such interindustry conferences seeking cooperatively for practical means of carrying into practice the recommendations brought out by the President's Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership. In such conferences lies an opportunity to serve the country in a vital need for better housing, and also to help forward the enlargement of employment in several major industries.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. T. J. Foster, Chairman, Forum on House Construction, Engineering Societies Building, 29 West 39th Street, New York City]
Note: The message was read at the opening session of the forum, meeting in the Engineering Societies Building, New York City. The forum, under the auspices of the American Institute of Steel Construction, brought architects and engineers together to discuss the problems of prefabricated housing.
