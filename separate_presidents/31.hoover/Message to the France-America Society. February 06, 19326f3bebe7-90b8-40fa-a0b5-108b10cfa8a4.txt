Message to the France-America Society.
[Released February 6, 1932. Dated February 2, 1932]
My dear Mr. Guthrie:
The one hundred and fifty-fourth anniversary of the signing of our treaties with France is a happy reminder of a continuing amity which has not only bound these nations together with ties of historic friendship and understanding but has strengthened the cause of human liberty. When the France-America Society meets on February sixth to commemorate this anniversary I shall appreciate if you will express my deep appreciation of its significance and extend my cordial greetings to the participants in the occasion.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. William D. Guthrie, President, The France-America Society of New York, 270 Madison Avenue, New York City]
