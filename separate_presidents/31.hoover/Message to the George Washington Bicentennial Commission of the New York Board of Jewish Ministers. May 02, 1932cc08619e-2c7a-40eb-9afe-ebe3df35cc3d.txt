Message to the George Washington Bicentennial Commission of the New York Board of Jewish Ministers.
[Released May 2, 1932. Dated April 30, 1932]
IT IS INDEED appropriate that an outstanding celebration of the George Washington Bicentennial should be that given under the auspices of the New York Board of Jewish Ministers, for Washington's reverent practice of religion was united with a profound belief in religious liberty, and his character offers an exalted evidence of the power of religious faith and discipline in strengthening and ennobling mankind in the midst of the most active practical concerns.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Dr. Israel Goldstein, Chairman, George Washington Bicentennial Commission of the New York Board of Jewish Ministers, 270 West 89th Street, New York City]
Note: The message was read at a bicentennial celebration sponsored by the board and held in the Synagogue of the Congregation Shearith Israel, the oldest Jewish congregation in the United States.
