Message to the Girl's Service League of America
[Released May 1931. Dated April 29, 1931
My dear Mrs. Hadden:
I appreciate very warmly what you and the members of the Girl's Service League of America have done in cooperation with the President's Emergency Committee for Employment. This work has been of the greatest social value besides its obvious humanitarian aspects. I will be obliged if you will convey to your associates my cordial thanks.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Alexander M. Hadden, President, Girl's Service League of America, 138 East Nineteenth Street, New York, N.Y.]
Note: The message was published in a pamphlet entitled "A Service for Girls," issued by the league in May 1931. The league's employment exchange in New York established an emergency program to provide relief and placement services for unemployed young women.
Similar messages were sent to other organizations cooperating in the emergency employment relief program.
[APP Note: The American Presidency Project uses the date of the message, rather than the publication date of "May 1931" that is used by the National Archives in the Public Papers of the Presidents series.]
