Message to the Gordon Bennett International Balloon Races and Aerial Carnival.
I EXTEND a most cordial welcome to the pilots and aides of the nations represented in the Gordon Bennett International Balloon Races at Cleveland on September 1st. This event is highly important, not only to the development of aviation, but also through friendly competition in a splendid sport it helps bring these nations more closely together. I speak for the Nation when I ask visitors from other lands to carry back this message of American good will to their fellow countrymen.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message, sent to Mr. William G. Rose, Mgr. Headquarters, Gordon Bennett International Balloon Race and Aerial Carnival, Cleveland, Ohio, was posted at the race headquarters in Cleveland.
