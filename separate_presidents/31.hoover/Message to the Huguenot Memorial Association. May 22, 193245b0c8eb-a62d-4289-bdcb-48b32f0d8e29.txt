[Released May 22, 1932. Dated May 18, 1932] My dear Mr. Frost:
I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the members of the Huguenot Memorial Association, and my appreciation of the high social values involved in the preservation of historical traditions through such permanent reminders of the past as the Washington Arch and Memorial Window.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
