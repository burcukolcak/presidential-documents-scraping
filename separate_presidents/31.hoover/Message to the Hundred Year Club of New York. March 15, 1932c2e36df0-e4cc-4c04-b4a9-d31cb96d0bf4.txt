Message to the Hundred Year Club of New York.
I WILL BE OBLIGED if you will express my cordial greetings to those gathered this evening at the fourth annual dinner of the Hundred Year Club of New York. The nature of your organization of itself demonstrates that American business survives all ebbs and flows of economic tides, and moves forward by virtue of the indomitable courage and energy and individual initiative of Americans. Likewise the earned tribute you will pay to Mr. Harvey D. Gibson illustrates the power of local community effort, when inspired by a sense of personal and civic responsibility, to meet all demands for humane helpfulness in times of stress.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Charles C. Paulding, President, The Hundred Year Club of New York, 453 Fifth Avenue, New York City]
Note: The message was read at the club's annual dinner which was held at the Savoy-Plaza Hotel in New York City. The organization honored Mr. Gibson, chairman of New York's Emergency Unemployment Relief Committee, with its gold medal for the individual contributing most to the city's civic and industrial development. The club consisted of New York commercial organizations a century or more old.
