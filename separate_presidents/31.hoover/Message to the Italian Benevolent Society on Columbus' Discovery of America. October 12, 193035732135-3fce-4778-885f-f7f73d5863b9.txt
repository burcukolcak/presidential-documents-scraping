Message to the Italian Benevolent Society on Columbus' Discovery of America.
[Released October 12, 1930. Dated September 23, 1930]
My dear Mr. Contessa:
The story of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus can never lose its fascination for us as a people, not merely because it tells of the event which made possible the very existence of our Nation, but even more because the example of his life of enterprise, energy, patience, resourcefulness and daring has done much to hold these qualities before the eyes of our youth as a tradition to be followed.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Vito Contessa, Chairman of the Festival, Italian Benevolent Society, 218 East 116th Street, New York City]
