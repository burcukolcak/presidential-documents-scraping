Message to the Jewish National Fund of America.
[Released February 22, 1932. Dated February 19, 1932]
My dear Mr. Ruttenberg:
I thank you cordially for bringing to my attention the purpose of American Jews, under the auspices of the Jewish National Fund, to plant a forest of pines and eucalyptus trees in Palestine, as a living memorial to George Washington. I am deeply interested in all proposals to honor the memory of our first President during this bicentennial year.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Nelson Ruttenberg, President, Jewish National Fund of America, 111 Fifth Avenue, New York City]
