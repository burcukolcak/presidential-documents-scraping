Message to the Lafayette College Conference on the French Backgrounds of American Civilization.
[Released May 17, 1932. Dated May 9, 1932]
My dear Dr. Lewis:
I am deeply interested to learn of the conference at Lafayette College on French Backgrounds of American Civilization and of the historical pageant visualizing them. Not only French pioneering enterprise, but also French culture, have profoundly influenced American history and American thought. It is therefore most fitting that we should at times adequately recall them to the public memory.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Dr. William Mather Lewis, President, Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania]
Note: The message was read at the opening exercises of a 3-day pageant celebrating the centennial of the founding of the college. The exercises were held at Colton Memorial Chapel.
