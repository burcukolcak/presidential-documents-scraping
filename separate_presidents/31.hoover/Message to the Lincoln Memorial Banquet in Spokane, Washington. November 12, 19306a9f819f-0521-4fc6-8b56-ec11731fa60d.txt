Message to the Lincoln Memorial Banquet in Spokane, Washington.
[Released November 12, 1930. Dated November 11, 1930]
THE THOUGHT of Abraham Lincoln instinctively recurs on every occasion when the conception of healing peace following conflict is in mind. It is most fitting, therefore, that you should dedicate his statue on this day consecrated to the memory of those whose sacrifices in the World War led the way to a more enduring peace.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message, sent to the Committee of Arrangements, Lincoln Memorial Banquet, Masonic Temple, Spokane, Wash., was read at a Victory Banquet commemorating Spokane's achievement in erecting and dedicating a memorial statue of Abraham Lincoln.
On November 11, 1930, at 4 p.m., the President pushed a telegraph key in Washington, D.C., freeing a balloon which lifted an American flag that veiled the statue.
