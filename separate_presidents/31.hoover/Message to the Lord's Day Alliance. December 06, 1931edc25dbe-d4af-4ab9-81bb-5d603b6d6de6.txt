Message to the Lord's Day Alliance.
[Released December 6, 1931. Dated December 3, 1931]
My dear Dr. Bowlby:
I am interested to learn that the Lord's Day Alliance of the United States will celebrate its forty-third anniversary on December 6th-7th. Its vigilant work in promoting reverent respect for the Sabbath Day is a potent factor in preserving the sacredness of that Day against secularization.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER

[Rev. H. L. Bowlby, D.D., General Secretary, Lord's Day Alliance of the United States, 156 Fifth Avenue, New York City]
