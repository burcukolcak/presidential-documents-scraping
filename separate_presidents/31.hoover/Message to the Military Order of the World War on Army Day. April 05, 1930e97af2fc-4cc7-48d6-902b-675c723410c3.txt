Message to the Military Order of the World War on Army Day.
My dear Admiral Cowie:
The great citizen components of the Army of the United States constitute an organized expression of patriotic citizenship. On Army Day, I wish to express the gratitude of the Nation to those who exposed their lives to the dangers of the battlefield and those who fell in defense of our national ideals.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Rear Adm. T. J. Cowie, Commander-in-Chief, Military Order of the World War, Washington, D.C.]
Note: Admiral Cowie read the message at Army Day ceremonies to an audience assembled in front of the State, War, and Navy Building in Washington, D.C.
