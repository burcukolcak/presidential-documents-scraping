Message to the Museum of Modern Art.
[Released May 9, 1932. Dated May 4, 1932]
SINCE THE CENTENNIAL at Philadelphia in 1876 the progress made by American artists and the advance in public taste have given to the United States a standing in the universal world of art. In this movement the government is playing a large part by providing for works of the fine arts to commemorate historic events and personages. Thus there is a demand for artists not only trained technically but also imbued with knowledge of American history, and inspired to interpret American ideals in such convincing manner as to foster love of country and emulation of heroic deeds.
The establishing of the Museum of Modern Art opens wide opportunities for appreciation by the public of the trends of the times in the fine arts, and also for friendly emulation among contemporary artists of all countries.
