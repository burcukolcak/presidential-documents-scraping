Message to the Nation's Christmas Tree Association.
[Released December 25, 1932. Dated December 6, 1932]
To the Nation's Christmas Tree Association:
Your Christmas service held each year at the foot of a living tree which was alive at the time of the birth of Christ, has now for several years lent an inspiring note to the celebration of Christmas. It should be continued as a further symbol of the unbroken chain of life leading back to this great moment in the spiritual life of mankind.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message was sent to Treffle R. LaSenay, Nation's Christmas Tree Association, Fresno, Calif.
The message was read at the annual ceremony at the base of the General Grant redwood in General Grant National Park. The tree, believed to be the world's oldest living thing, had been designated in 1925 as the Nation's Christmas tree.
