Message to the National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools.
My dear Mr. Lucas:
The National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools, which convenes in Washington this evening for its annual meeting, comprises a group of men and women whose services to their race and to our country are invaluable. To thousands of children and youth they bring not only opportunities for general education, but promotion of health, worthy home environments, vocational guidance and character training, all of which make for useful, self-reliant and law abiding lives. The schools and colleges in which they teach can render a service of great value in helping to translate into actual practice the standards and principles set forth in the Children's Charter adopted by the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. Education is not only the foundation of personal efficiency but is the solvent of many of the problems which confront us as a nation. The work of these teachers represents a social service and practical patriotism of high order. I shall be obliged if you will extend my greetings and congratulations to the delegates and my good wishes for a convention which will lend strength and inspiration to them in their important work.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. M. Grant Lucas, President, National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools, 1738 Fifteenth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.]
