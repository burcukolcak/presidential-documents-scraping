Message to the National Conference on Palestine.
[Released January 17, 1932. Dated January 12, 1932]
My dear Mr. Rothenberg:
I am interested to know that a national conference has been called in New York on January 17th to plan for the continued maintenance in the Jewish homeland of those institutions into whose establishment has gone so much of material assistance, labor and sacrifice. Your efforts hold universal significance to Jewry, even as the Jewish people have made a world contribution to spiritual advancement. I will appreciate it if you will extend to those attending your meeting my cordial greetings and good wishes.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER

[Mr. Morris Rothenberg, National Chairman, American Palestine Campaign of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, 111 Fifth Avenue, New York City]
