Message to the National Education Association Convention.
[Released June 28, 1930. Dated June 26, 1930]
THE MOST important work of men and women is to care for boys and girls, to give them a happy childhood and to equip them for a successful life. Our task is to give every child the opportunity to grow up with a healthy body, a trained mind, a disciplined character, a cheerful faith in himself and a devotion to our form of government. The public school system is America's distinctive and magnificent ally of the home in this most precious trust.

[Mr. Joy Morgan, Editor, The Journal of the National Education Association, 1201 Sixteenth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.]
Note: The message was read to the convention of the National Education Association meeting in Columbus, Ohio.
