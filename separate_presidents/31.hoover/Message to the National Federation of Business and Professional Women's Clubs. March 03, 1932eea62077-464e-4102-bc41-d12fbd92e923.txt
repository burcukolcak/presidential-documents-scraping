I THANK the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs for its prompt and generous offer of cooperation in furthering the objectives of the Administration's Anti-Hoarding Conference, through the activities of its National Business Women's Week. Restoration of our usual economic prosperity is the business of every citizen. Confidence and courage such as yours is contagious. I extend to all your clubs my congratulations and my very good wishes for a successful National Business Women's Week.
