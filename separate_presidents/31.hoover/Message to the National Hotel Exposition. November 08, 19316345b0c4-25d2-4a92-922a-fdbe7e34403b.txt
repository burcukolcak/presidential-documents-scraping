Message to the National Hotel Exposition.
[Released November 8, 1931. Dated November 3, 1931 ]
My dear Mr. McKowne:
I have been interested to learn of your plans for the sixteenth National Hotel Exposition in New York, and especially of your plans to align the industry with the constructive influences and forces working for economic recovery. It is to the lasting credit of the American business man that he is facing the future with courage and confidence. It is that spirit, plus the necessary reordering and readjusting of our economic life to current conditions, which will eventually solve the difficulties which confront us. I trust that your exposition may give impetus to improvement not only in the hotel industry, but in business generally.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. F. A. McKowne, President, Hotel Ass'n. of New York City, 221 West 57th Street, New York City ]
