Message to the National Recreation Congress.
[Released October 15, 1929. Dated October 12, 1929]
My dear Mrs. Meyer:
I am deeply interested in the problem of recreation, as its solution goes to the root not only of many fundamental questions of physical health, but also of many needs for mental stimulation and spiritual satisfactions. A national program is needed, and the conference at Louisville can be of great service in its consideration.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Eugene Meyer, Seven Springs Farm, Mount Kisco, New York]
Note: The President's letter was read by Mrs. Meyer in a preface to her address to the National Recreation Congress in Louisville, Ky. Mrs. Meyer was then chairman of the Westchester County Recreation Commission.
