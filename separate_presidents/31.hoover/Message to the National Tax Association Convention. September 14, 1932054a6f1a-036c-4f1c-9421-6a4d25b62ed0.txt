Message to the National Tax Association Convention.
[Released September 14, 1932. Dated September 13, 1932]
I WILL BE OBLIGED if you will express my cordial greetings to the Twenty-fifth Annual Convention on Taxation and my warm appreciation of their splendid record of accomplishments in promoting the scientific study of problems in the fields of public finance and taxation, and in bringing about reforms in our tax systems, tax administration, and a better coordination of tax policies. Along with the necessity for drastic tax reduction the most pressing fiscal problem of the day is to adjust the State and local tax systems to modern conditions, so as to relieve the burden on real property which now presses so inequitably upon the farmer and the small home owner. Your Conference can render a great service in this field.
HERBERT HOOVER
