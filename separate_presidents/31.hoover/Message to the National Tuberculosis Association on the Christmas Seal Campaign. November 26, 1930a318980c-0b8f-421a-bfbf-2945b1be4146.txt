Message to the National Tuberculosis Association on the Christmas Seal Campaign.
[Released November 26, 1930. Dated October 31, 1930]
THE CHRISTMAS SEALS of the National Tuberculosis Association which are sold at Christmastime every year provide funds for one of the most valuable of all services to mankind in helping to prevent and destroy a disease which threatens millions of homes and weakens millions of the children and youth of the Nation. I commend this yearly campaign to all our people.
