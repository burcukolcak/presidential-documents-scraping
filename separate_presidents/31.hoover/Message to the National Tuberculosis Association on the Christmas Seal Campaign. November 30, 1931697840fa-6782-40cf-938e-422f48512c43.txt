Message to the National Tuberculosis Association on the Christmas Seal Campaign.
[Released November 30, 1931. Dated November 23, 1931]
I COMMEND to all our people the annual sale of Christmas Seals conducted by the National Tuberculosis Association and its affiliated State and local associations. These seals sold during the holiday season provide the funds which make possible the organized campaign for the prevention of tuberculosis. These efforts are showing encouraging results in a diminishing death rate. The proceeds of the seal sale make possible one of the most valuable of all services to mankind in helping to check and destroy a disease which endangers millions of homes and weakens millions of citizens, especially the children and youth of the nation. It is especially important at this time to protect the health and physical stamina of our people.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message was made public in conjunction with the launching of the 25th annual Christmas Seal campaign.
