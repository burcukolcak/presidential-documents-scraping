My dear Dr. Carter:
Mr. Akerson has handed to me your kind letter of November 29 and the Bible which the Society has been so good as to send me in commemoration of its 120th Anniversary. I am glad to receive it and do appreciate the kindness which prompted this thoughtful gift.
Thank you too for your heartening expressions of confidence and approval.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
