Message to the New York City Emergency Employment Committee.
[Released October 22, 1930. Dated October 21, 1930]
I WANT YOU to express to the members of the Emergency Employment Committee my appreciation of the high purpose which has prompted them to undertake the task of assisting through your own well-organized local agencies the unemployment problem in New York City. Local committees such as yours who are willing to assume responsibility, furnish an indispensable medium for finding employment for those who might otherwise be destitute.
The instrumentalities of our Government today require and seek the cooperation of the leaders of business and welfare in each community. The common obligation is to find work for the needy and to care for the destitute. The interdependence of all men and women, particularly in times of depression, must be evident to every clear-thinking citizen. Moreover the finding of even temporary work is a real step toward our common objective which is to assist in every way we can to bring back a sound revival of business.
I have, therefore, every confidence that your committee will receive from your community the wholehearted and generous support which it deserves.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message, sent to Seward Prosser, chairman, Emergency Employment Committee, 5 Nassau Street, New York, was read at a luncheon in the India House in New York on October 22, 1930. The luncheon was held for the purpose of organizing a fund-raising campaign.
