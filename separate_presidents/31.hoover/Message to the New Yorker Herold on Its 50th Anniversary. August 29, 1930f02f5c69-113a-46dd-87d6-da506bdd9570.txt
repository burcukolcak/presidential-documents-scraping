Message to the New Yorker Herold on Its 50th Anniversary.
[Released August 29, 1930. Dated August 28, 1930]
My dear Mr. Holz:
I am gratified to learn that the New Yorker Herold is about to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its founding and I cordially extend to you, your associates in its publication, and the large audience to whom it is addressed, my hearty congratulations and best wishes for the future. You are engaged in a most worthy undertaking when you seek to bridge the difficulties raised by the difference in language, customs, and conceptions of public problems, and assist the very valuable immigrant stock of Germanic origin in this country to adjust themselves to their new loyalties, and to give in largest measure their contribution of industry, idealism, and public spirit to the service of our country.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Julius Holz, Publisher, The New Yorker Herold, 22 North William Street, New York City ]
