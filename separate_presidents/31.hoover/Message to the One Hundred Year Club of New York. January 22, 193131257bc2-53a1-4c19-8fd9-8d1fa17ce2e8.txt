Message to the One Hundred Year Club of New York.
[Released January 22, 1931. Dated January 21, 1931]
I WILL be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to those present at the third annual dinner of the One Hundred Year Club of New York. The existence of such a society, representing so many industrial and professional organizations still flourishing after one hundred years of unbroken activity is in itself a demonstration of the inherent stability of American life with its endless opportunities for profitable enterprise through all temporary vicissitudes. I send you my confident good wishes for continued success.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Charles C. Paulding, President, The One Hundred Year Club of New York, New York City]
Note: The message was read at the club's third annual dinner, held in the Savoy Plaza Hotel in New York City. The organization comprised New York City firms a century or more old.
