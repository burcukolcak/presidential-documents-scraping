Message to the Parents' Magazine.
[Released September 23, 1931. Dated July 31, 1931]
My dear Mr. Hecht:
Often the best way to help children is to help their parents. The Parents' Magazine does this by making available to parents the rich and significant store of information which child health authorities, educators, psychologists and others are developing on methods of rearing children. The recent White House Conference on Child Health and Protection recognized that anything which better fits our fathers and mothers for the paramount profession of parenthood helps to realize the rights and standards of health and protection embodied in the Children's Charter. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of your useful magazine I extend to you my cordial congratulations and good wishes.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. George J. Hecht, President, The Parents' Magazine, 255 Fourth Ave., New York City ]
