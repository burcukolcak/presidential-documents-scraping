Message to the Real Estate Board of New York.
[Released January 14, 1932. Dated January 7, 1932]
My dear Mr. Phillips:
I have been interested to learn of your plans for a Building Merchandise Exposition as part of a systematic effort to promote modernization and restoration of existing properties for business and residence purposes. Such activity is an important supplement to new construction and is also desirable as a measure to promote employment. I hope that the exposition may contribute to attaining your objectives.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Harry D. Phillips, Publications Director, the Real Estate Board of New York, Inc., 12 East 41st Street, New York City]
