My dear Mr. Proctor:
I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the sixth conference of the New England Council. Your steadfast application of research methods to the economic needs of New England, your encouragement of a more businesslike agriculture and a more effective industry, and your patriotic efforts to help stabilize employment deserves hearty commendation. Collective effort by all elements of your region in meeting common problems makes strongly for success.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
