I WILL BE OBLIGED if you will express my cordial greetings to the Southern Baptist Convention now in session, and my deep appreciation of the importance to the national well-being of the service of the churches in the spiritual life of the nation. I do pray that the deliberations of your convention may be fruitful of wise counsels for the benefit of our country.
