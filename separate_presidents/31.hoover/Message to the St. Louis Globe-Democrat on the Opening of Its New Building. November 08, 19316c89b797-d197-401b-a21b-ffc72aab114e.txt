Message to the St. Louis Globe-Democrat on the Opening of Its New Building.
[Released November 8, 1931. Dated October 23, 1931 ]
My dear Mr. Ray:
Please accept for yourself and your associates my hearty congratulations as the St. Louis Globe-Democrat moves into its new building. I hope that the occasion may mark the beginning of an era of even greater service to the community and the country. The Globe-Democrat has an enviable and deserved reputation for enterprise and impartiality in publishing the news and for independence, fairness and insight in editorial interpretation. Such a conception of its responsibility helps to bring to our public life and the public service the strength of an informed and potent public opinion. You have my best wishes for continued prosperity and growth.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. E. Lansing Ray, President, St. Louis Globe-Democrat, St. Louis, Missouri]
