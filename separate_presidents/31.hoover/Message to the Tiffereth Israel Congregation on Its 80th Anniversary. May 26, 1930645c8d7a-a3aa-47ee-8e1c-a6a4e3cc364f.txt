My dear Dr. Silver:
I cordially congratulate you and the congregation of The Temple upon the happy occasion of its eightieth anniversary. The service of religion inspires many of the noblest human qualities, and is one of the strongest bonds of unity in our National life. I send you my best wishes for long continuance and success in these labors.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
