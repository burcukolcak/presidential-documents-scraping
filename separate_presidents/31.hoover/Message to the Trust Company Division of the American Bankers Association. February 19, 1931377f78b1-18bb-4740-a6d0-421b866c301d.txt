[Released February 19, 1931. Dated February 4, 1931 ]
My dear Mr. Stephenson:
I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to those present at the 20th annual banquet of the Trust Companies of the United States on Thursday evening, February 19th. The Trust Companies have been an influence of high value in the economic life of the nation, by conserving accumulated resources, stabilizing investments and providing continuity of conservative policy in business. Their remarkable increase in numbers and influence has on the whole been an important service in the life of the nation.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Gilbert T. Stephenson, President, Trust Company Division, The American Bankers Association, Wilmington, Delaware]
