Message to the Young Men's Christian Association of New York City.
[Released January 18, 1932. Dated January 11, 1932]
My dear Mr. Lawrence:
I shall appreciate it if you will express my cordial congratulations to the Young Men's Christian Association of the City of New York on its eightieth birthday. Its services and influence during more than three quarters of a century have left their imprint upon the life and character of vast numbers of men and youth. It is a record to inspire gratification and confidence for the future. I am particularly pleased to know that even under current handicaps the Association has splendidly expanded its buildings as well as its educational, recreational and character building activities. Your recognition of the importance of maintaining such agencies at maximum strength and efficiency under prevailing conditions and your enterprise in doing so, merits the grateful recognition of the community.
With all good wishes for the increasing usefulness of the Association, I am,
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
