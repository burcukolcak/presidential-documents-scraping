Message to the Young People of the United Brethren in Christ.
[Released May 19, 1929. Dated May 15, 1929]
PLEASE SAY for me to the young people of the United Brethren in Christ that they and their kind are the brightest hope of their country, because they retain unspoiled by cynicism the ideals of youth in which [p.148] alone are found the faith, courage, will and energy by which visions of social and moral advance are translated into actualities.
HERBERT HOOVER
Note: The message was sent by telegram to J. Gordon Howard, General Young People's Superintendent, United Brethren in Christ, Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
