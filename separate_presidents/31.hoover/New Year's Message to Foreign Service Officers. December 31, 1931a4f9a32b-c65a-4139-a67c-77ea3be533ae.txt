New Year's Message to Foreign Service Officers.
To Diplomatic and Consular Officers:
I send cordial greetings at the advent of the New Year to our diplomatic and consular officers abroad with all good wishes for the satisfactions which your service merits. The government draws upon the personnel of its Foreign Service throughout the world for much in the way of information, negotiation, and tactful relationships. The New Year will bring many problems, but if we at home and you abroad maintain our industry, courage, and confidence in the principles and institutions which this country exemplifies, we can do much to promote economic recovery and international friendship. A sound and stable United States is a contribution to the well-being of the world.
HERBERT HOOVER
