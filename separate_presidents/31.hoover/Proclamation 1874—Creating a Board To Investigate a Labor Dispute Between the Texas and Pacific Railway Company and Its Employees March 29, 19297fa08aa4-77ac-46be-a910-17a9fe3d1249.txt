Note: The Texas and Pacific Railway Company dispute began when the company decided to move its freight yards from Longview Junction and Marshall, Tex., to Mineola, Tex., and Shreveport, La. Affected employees, a number of whom were forced to sell their homes, argued that they should be compensated for any losses and inconveniences involved. They also objected to contemplated changes in work assignments. After negotiations and Federal mediation failed to produce any agreement, four of the railroad brotherhoods (the engineers, firemen, conductors, and trainmen) issued strike orders that were to go into effect on March 30, 1929.
