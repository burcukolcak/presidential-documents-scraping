Proclamation 1885â€”Exportation of Arms or Munitions of War to Mexico

Whereas, by a Proclamation of the President issued on January 7, 1924, under a Joint Resolution of Congress approved January 31, 1922, it was declared that there existed in Mexico such conditions of domestic violence as were or might be promoted by the use of arms or munitions of war procured from the United States; and
Whereas, by the Joint Resolution above mentioned it thereupon became unlawful to export arms or munitions of war to Mexico except under such limitations and exceptions as the President should prescribe:
Now, Therefore, I, Herbert Hoover,President of the United States of America do hereby declare and proclaim that, as the conditions on which the Proclamation of January 7, 1924, was based no longer obtain, the said Proclamation is hereby revoked.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Doneat the City of Washington this eighteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and fifty-fourth.

H. L. STIMSON
Secretary of State.
Note: During the Mexican rebellion which began in March 1929, the Hoover administration kept in effect an arms embargo originally proclaimed during the De La Huerta insurrection of 1924, thus denying aid to the insurrectionists. At the same time, surplus arms from United States Army stocks were made available to the Mexican Government. Once the fighting was over, Mexico requested that the arms embargo be lifted, and this was the action taken under Proclamation 1885.
