DR. MILLIKAN'S address tonight on "Radio's Past and Future" is the first of a series arranged by the National Advisory Council on Radio in Education, of which society he is the president. It is the purpose of the association to provide the radio audience with addresses from the leading authorities upon significant developments in the fields of science, arts, and the professions. It is distinctly a public service that the leaders in thought in our country have banded themselves together to give to the radio audience this opportunity of knowing from those who can speak with authority the progress that we are making in the fundamentals of civilization.
Dr. Millikan is one of America's foremost scientists. He ranks among the world's greatest physicists. He is the director of one of the most successful of our great physics research laboratories. He has given to America great contributions in the whole field of education and science. Dr. Millikan is more than a physicist. He is one of America's leaders in philosophic thought.
Dr. Millikan will now speak to you from Los Angeles, California.
