Radio Remarks on the Opening of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
OUR HOTELS have become community institutions. They are the center points of civic hospitality. They are the meeting place of a thousand community and national activities. They have come to be conducted in far larger vision than mere profit earning. If we considered them solely from an economic point of view we would find them among the nine leaders of American industry.
The opening of the new Waldorf-Astoria is an event in the development of hotels even in New York City. It carries on a great tradition in national hospitality. It was 137 years ago that the first so-called great hotel was opened in New York--the old City Hotel--which was then heralded as an immense establishment and comprised 73 rooms. It was visited from all parts of the country as one of the fine exhibits of our national growth. A long line of constantly improving hotels from that day to this has marked the measure of the Nation's growth in power, in comfort, and in artistry.
The erection of this great structure at this time has been a contribution to the maintenance of employment and is an exhibition of courage and confidence to the whole Nation. This occasion is really but the moving day of an old institution with all its traditions of hospitality and service into a new and better structure. I have faith that in another 50 years the growth of America in wealth, science, and art will necessitate the institution's moving again to an even finer and more magnificent place and equipment.
I wish to congratulate the management on the consummation of its plan for the magnificent new home perpetuating the Waldorf-Astoria.
Note: The President spoke at 6:05 p.m. from the Cabinet Room in the WhiteHouse to an assembly in the new Waldorf-Astoria in New York City. The National Broadcasting Company radio network carried the President's remarks.
