Herbert Hoover
June 15, 1931

Remarks at Charleston, West Virginia.
Mr. Governor, my dear fellow citizens:
It is most kind of you to come to the station to greet Mrs. Hoover and me this morning. It is again a gracious proof of the hospitality of the people of West Virginia. I have greatly enjoyed the journey over the State this morning. The scenery, the homes of West Virginia are always inspiring.
I have also had the pleasure this morning of following the Kanawha, a project in which I have been much interested for many years but have not before seen. This important Federal project is now nearing the stage of completion. I believe it will greatly aid the progress of the State.
But I am not here to address you upon serious subjects. I have to deliver a serious speech tonight. I do wish to express to you the gratitude of Mrs. Hoover and myself for the kindliness and cordiality of your welcome.
Note: The President spoke to an estimated 2,500 people gathered around the rear platform of the Presidential train, which was en route to Indianapolis, Ind. In his remarks, the President referred to Governor William G. Conley.
