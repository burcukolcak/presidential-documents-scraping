Herbert Hoover
March 23, 1931

Remarks at Ponce, Porto Rico.
Fellow citizens:
I deeply appreciate your welcome and I am extremely glad of the opportunity to visit you and learn more about your problems. I am glad to visit the only part of the United States visited by Columbus. We regard it as the oldest part of the United States.
It is also a great satisfaction to confer with your able Governor, whose distinguished father was the first to promote the welfare of this island. I have been greatly impressed by the courage with which you have faced your difficulties. I only wish I could stay longer and enlarge the acquaintance of my fellow citizens here.
Note: The President spoke at approximately 8 a. m. from a balcony at Ponce City Hall in response to welcoming remarks of Mayor Emilio Fagot and Governor Theodore Roosevelt. Following the welcoming ceremony, the President went by motorcade to San Juan.
