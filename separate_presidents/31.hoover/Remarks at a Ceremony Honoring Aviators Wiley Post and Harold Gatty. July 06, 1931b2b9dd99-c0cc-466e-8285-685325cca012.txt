Remarks at a Ceremony Honoring Aviators Wiley Post and Harold Gatty.
I AM HAPPY personally to congratulate you on your achievement of flying around the world in the remarkable time of less than 9 days. The first flight around the world was made only 7 years ago, when officers of the United States Army spent 15 days and 6 hours in the air, but, because of many delays and mishaps, required 175 days for the entire journey.
Your accomplishment is striking testimony of the advancement which has been made during the last few years by American pilots and American engineers. I congratulate you on your courage, determination, technical ability, and skill.
Note: The President spoke in ceremonies held on the White House lawn. Messrs. Post and Gatty were the honored guests at a White House luncheon on the same day.
