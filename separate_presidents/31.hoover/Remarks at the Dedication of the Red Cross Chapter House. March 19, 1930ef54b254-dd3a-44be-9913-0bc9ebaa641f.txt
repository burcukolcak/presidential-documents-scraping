Remarks at the Dedication of the Red Cross Chapter House.
General Pershing, ladies and gentlemen:
On the part of the United States Government I accept with pleasure the share in this beautiful memorial, given by those who have helped to make it possible.
To the patriotic mothers who gave their sons, to the many other loyal women who lost those dear to them for their country's sake, to the noble women, so many of them nurses, who died in war service, to all those who served with devotion throughout the war, we owe a deep debt of gratitude. May they ever see in this memorial a token of the honor and affection in which their country holds them.
It is a satisfaction that this memorial has taken not only the form of a beautiful building, but that within its walls there will be carried on the services it commemorates, services for our suffering fellow men.
The inscription in the hall below calls this "A Living Memorial." No better memorial can be built to the American women of the World War--and no truer inspiration given to the women of today.
Note: The President spoke at 4 p.m. to an audience of 600 in the auditorium of the new chapter house erected adjacent to the American Red Cross Building in Washington, D.C. His remarks were broadcast to the Nation over the Columbia Broadcasting System.
Gen. John J. Pershing was Chairman of the American Battle Monuments Commission.
