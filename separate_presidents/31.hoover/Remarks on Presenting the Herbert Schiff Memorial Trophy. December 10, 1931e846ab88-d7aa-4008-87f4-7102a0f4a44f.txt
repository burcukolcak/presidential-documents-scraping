Remarks on Presenting the Herbert Schiff Memorial Trophy.
Lieutenant Commander Whitehead:
As the United States Naval Reserve Aviation Base at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, New York, has been awarded the Herbert Schiff Memorial Trophy for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1931, I take pleasure in turning over to you, as the Commanding Officer of that Base, this splendid memorial trophy. The record of your base, with 3,441 hours of flying time, without accident to personnel or material, is an accomplishment well worthy of commendation. Please accept for the officers and men under your command my heartiest congratulations.
Note: The President presented the trophy to Lt. Comdr. Richard P. Whitehead at 12:30 p.m. Secretary of the Navy Adams, Adm. William A. Moffett, and William Schiff, donor of the trophy, also attended. The award was made annually to the naval squadron flying the greatest number of hours without accident.
