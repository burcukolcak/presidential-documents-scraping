Statement About Appointments to the Interstate Commerce Commission.
I REGRET to say that Commissioner Campbell's resignation has been received. He has been a distinguished public servant.
I shall appoint someone from the Intermountain States to the vacancy. At the request of Mr. Jones, of Tennessee, I shall withdraw his name, as upon reconsideration he has concluded that he does not wish to accept the appointment. It will again be made from the Southern States.
Note: Johnston B. Campbell was a Commissioner on the Interstate Commerce Commission from 1921 to 1930 and served as Chairman from 1928 to 1930. Robert M. Jones was a lawyer from Knoxville, Tenn.
The President nominated William E. Lee, of Idaho, on January 9, 1930, and Hugh McCall Tate, of Tennessee, on February 8 to be Interstate Commerce Commissioners. In connection with the nominations, the White House issued, on January 18 and February 10, brief biographical data on the nominees and lists of individuals endorsing them.
