Statement About Repair of the Executive Offices.
IT IS our intention to repair the present executive offices, making them as fully fireproof as possible. This can be accomplished in 2 or 3 months.
A number of Members of Congress and others have suggested that a new and more imposing executive office should be erected on some offer site. That is a matter that would require 2 or 3 years for the development of thought and design. The present offices will serve all purposes for the next few years, and I am much more anxious to expedite the erection of the departmental buildings, which are so urgently needed. The time will undoubtedly come when a larger and more dignified executive office should be erected.
Note: A fire on Christmas eve, 1929, did extensive damage to the executive office wing. See 1929 volume, Item 328.
