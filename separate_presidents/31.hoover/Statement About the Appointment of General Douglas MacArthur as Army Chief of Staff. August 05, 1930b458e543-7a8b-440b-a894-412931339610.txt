Statement About the Appointment of General Douglas MacArthur as Army Chief of Staff.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I have decided to appoint General MacArthur as Chief of Staff of the Army on the retirement of General [Charles P.] Summerall. General MacArthur is recommended by Secretary Hurley, and it, of course, gives me a great deal of pleasure to promote so brilliant a soldier to that position. He is the only one of the major generals who has a sufficient period prior to retirement to serve the full period of the 4-year term. While there are very eminent gentlemen who outrank him, none of them I believe have 18 months to serve before retirement or at least are short of the full term.
"General MacArthur is in command of the Philippines, as you know. At the present moment he is on temporary duty in China, and if you want more data about his career you can find it over at the War Department.
"I am sure General MacArthur will maintain the very high standards set by his many eminent predecessors, and I am sure the whole country appreciates the great service of General Summerall and regrets that he has reached the time of life when he must retire from active duty."
