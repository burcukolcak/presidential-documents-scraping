Statement About the Resignation of George E. Akerson as Secretary to the President.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"The only news item I have at the moment is that Mr. Akerson is leaving the White House service. Someone has offered him two or three times the pay the Government can afford, and he has responsibilities to his family that I cannot deny. I do greatly regret to lose an old friend out of my personal service."
Note: Mr. Akerson, Secretary to the President since March 4, 1929, resigned to become a member of the executive staff of the Paramount Public Corporation.
