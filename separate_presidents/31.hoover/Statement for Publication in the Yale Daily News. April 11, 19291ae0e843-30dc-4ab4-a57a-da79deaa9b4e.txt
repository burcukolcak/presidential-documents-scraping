Statement for Publication in the Yale Daily News.
[Released April 11, 1929. Dated April 9, 1929]
My dear Mr. Taylor:
I am glad to give you the following statement which you are at liberty to publish in the Yale Daily News:
"The need for college graduates in State and National politics is simply the need for trained minds and formed characters that exists in all departments of modern life. The increasingly complex structure of the society requires more and more of the technical skill and of the cultural background that the colleges undertake to provide. As politics is but one aspect of the social order, its need of men of special educational equipment is as obvious as this need is now in business or the professions."
With all good wishes,
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Marshall Taylor, Yale News, New Haven, Connecticut]
Note: The statement was requested by the Board of Editors of the Yale publication for inclusion in their series of articles by outstanding statesmen of the Nation on the subject, "The Need for College Graduates in National and State Politics." It was published simultaneously in the Yale Daily News and other newspapers.
