Statement on Appointments to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.
THE PRESIDENT said:
I have requested General [Charles G.] Dawes to accept the position of President of the new Reconstruction Corporation. It is gratifying to state that he has accepted. Mr. Eugene Meyer, Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, will also be Chairman of the Board of the Reconstruction Corporation.
In order that we may preserve the nonpartisan character of the institution, the other Directors will be chosen after consultation with leaders of both political parties upon completion of the legislation.
I announce General Dawes' name at this time because of the required change in plans as to the Chairmanship of the delegation to the Arms Conference. Otherwise, General Dawes would be leaving for Europe tomorrow.
