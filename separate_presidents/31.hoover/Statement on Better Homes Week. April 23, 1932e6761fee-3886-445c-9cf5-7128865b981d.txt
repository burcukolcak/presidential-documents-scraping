Statement on Better Homes Week.
FOR MANY YEARS Better Homes in America has contributed to our national well-being by stimulating improvement of existing homes and construction of new homes of sound standards of design, construction, and equipment. Its 8,500 committees have spent months preparing admirable education programs for unemployment relief through home care and repair, by contests for home garden improvement, and by demonstration of new and reconditioned houses. All they can do to encourage homeownership, to improve home design, decoration and furnishing, to improve the design and arrangement of kitchens, to better the upkeep and planning of gardens, and to add to healthfulness and wholesomeness in the home environment, will serve to promote the finer values of the home, community, and Nation.
I cordially commend the Better Homes movement, and urge all our people to share wholeheartedly in observance of the week beginning April 24th as National Better Homes Week.
Note: Better Homes Week was sponsored by Better Homes in America, a voluntary public service corporation that President Hoover had helped organize while Secretary of Commerce. The week's activities consisted of an annual campaign of exhibits and educational projects aimed at improving housing and household management.
