Statement on Bonus Legislation for World War Veterans
THE PRESIDENT said:
"Informal polls of the House of Representatives have created apprehension in the country that a further bonus bill of $2 billion or thereabouts for World War veterans will be passed.
"I wish to state again that I am absolutely opposed to any such legislation. I made this position clear at the meeting of the American Legion in Detroit last September 21, and the Legion has consistently supported that position. I do not believe any such legislation can become law.
"Such action would undo every effort that is being made to reduce Government expenditures and balance the budget. The first duty of every citizen of the United States is to build up and sustain the credit of the United States Government. Such an action would irretrievably undermine it."
Note: On January 14, 1932, Representative Wright Patman introduced H.R. 7726 which provided for full payment of the World War adjusted compensation certificates and authorized an issue of paper money to finance the operation.
