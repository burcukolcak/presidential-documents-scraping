Statement on Columbus Day.
THE ANNUAL CELEBRATION of Columbus Day serves not only to commemorate the glorious achievement of the great discoverer but also to remind the millions of his compatriots who have followed him to these shores of the blessings they have found in this land of hope and opportunity. They on their part have enriched our national life in terms of art, letters, and many of the most useful constructive occupations. I send them my cordial greetings.
Note: The Republican National Committee released the statement on October 8, 1932. It was read on October 12 as part of the Columbus Day ceremonies held at Columbus Circle in New York City.
