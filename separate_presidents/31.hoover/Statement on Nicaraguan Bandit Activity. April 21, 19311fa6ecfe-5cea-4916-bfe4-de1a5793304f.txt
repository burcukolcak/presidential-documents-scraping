Statement on Nicaraguan Bandit Activity.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"Our advices are that the Nicaraguan Government has now placed in the field a total of over 1,300 men of the newly created National Guard in a drive to clean up [Augusto Cesar] Sandino and his fellow bandits. Our representatives advise that this force is several times that of Sandino and his bands. His raids upon important points have been frustrated by the dispositions of the guard and protection of our citizens on the coast is made doubly sure by the presence of our naval vessels.
"Sandino has placed himself and his band outside the civilized pale by the coldblooded murder of eight or nine American civilians and many Nicaraguans at isolated places in the interior.
"The Nicaraguan Government has shown itself fully cognizant of its responsibilities. It is moving vigorously despite the difficulties created by the earthquake. While it may require some time to accomplish their purpose due to the mountainous and jungle character of the country, I am confident Sandino will be brought to justice."
