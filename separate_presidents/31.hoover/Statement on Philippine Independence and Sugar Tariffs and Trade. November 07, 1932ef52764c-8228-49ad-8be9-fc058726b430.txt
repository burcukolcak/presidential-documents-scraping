Statement on Philippine Independence and Sugar Tariffs and Trade.
THE PRESIDENT said:
My attention has been called to the misrepresentation by Democratic agencies upon the question of the restriction of Philippine sugar. The Democratic Hawes-Hayes bill provides for a probation for Philippine independence varying from 9 to 17 years during which time the quota of sugar which can be imported free is to be increased from the present average of about 600,000 tons to 850,000 tons. At the end of that period a catastrophe will come to the Philippine people through the total break of their duty-free trade relations with us.
The Republican proposal is of a gradually modified relationship with the Philippines. We say that they cannot in their own interest attain political independence until they have secured economic independence. We therefore say that their amount of duty-free sugar must not be increased at all, but on the contrary must start at 600,000 tons and be reduced every year in order to gradually establish their economic independence. That is in the interest of both the Philippines and the American farmer.
The Democratic proposal continues and makes worse the situation of the American farmer for 9 to 17 years and in the end plunges the Philippines into ruin as the price of their liberty. The Republican proposal gives immediate relief to the beet sugar grower and brings about a safe basis of Philippine independence.
Note: The President issued the statement before leaving Denver. The tariff and its relationship to Philippine independence had been a major campaign issue in Colorado.
