Statement on Philippine Independence.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"With Secretary Hurley's return, the Cabinet this morning discussed the Philippine question at considerable length. We explored the subject, but formulated no conclusive policies in the matter. These discussions will be continued. Independence of the Philippines at sometime has been directly or indirectly promised by every President and by the Congress. In accord with those undertakings, the problem is one of time. In the interest of the Philippine people, the time clement involves the necessity that independence must be assured of durability and the Government of the Philippines must be assured of stability. For instance, the economic independence of the Philippines must be attained before political independence can be successful. Independence tomorrow without assured economic stability would result in the collapse of Philippine Government revenues and the collapse of all economic life in the islands. We propose to give further consideration to the whole question during the immediate future."
Note: Secretary of War Patrick J. Hurley visited the Philippines from August 31 to September 26, 1931.
