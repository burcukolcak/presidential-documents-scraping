Statement on Progress Toward Naval Reduction at the Geneva Meeting of the Preparatory Commission on the Disarmament Conference.
IN REPLY to inquiries from the press the President said:
"I am greatly gratified at the promising character of the results for naval reduction arising out of the recent Geneva conference. All of the principal naval powers have expressed adherence to the principles suggested by the American delegation, which include the conception of reduction instead of limitation of naval strength. They have expressed their desire for full and frank discussion and the development of the American formula into a practical step. The manner by which these discussions are to be initiated has not yet been determined, but the question will be followed up promptly."
