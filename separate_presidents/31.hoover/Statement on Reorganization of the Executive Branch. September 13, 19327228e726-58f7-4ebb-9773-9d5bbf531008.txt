Statement on Reorganization of the Executive Branch.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"Upon my recommendation the Congress at its last session gave to the President authority to reorganize the executive branches of the Government by regrouping, consolidating, and reducing the number of bureaus and commissions, eliminating overlap and duplication of effort in order to bring about large economies. Under the provisions of the law, the President is to issue Executive orders covering such changes and these orders are to be transmitted to Congress, to become effective after 60 calendar days should Congress not disapprove of them.
"The law creating the Bureau of the Budget provides that that Bureau, on direction of the President, shall make detailed studies for purposes of determining changes in the executive organization.
"I have today directed that the Director of the Budget shall set up the staff to make the necessary detailed investigations and prepare Executive orders for reorganization of the whole structure of the Federal Government. These orders covering the entire executive establishments will be completed and presented to the Congress immediately on its convening in December."
Note: The President was authorized to act under Public, No. 212 (47 Stat. 399), approved June 30, 1932.
