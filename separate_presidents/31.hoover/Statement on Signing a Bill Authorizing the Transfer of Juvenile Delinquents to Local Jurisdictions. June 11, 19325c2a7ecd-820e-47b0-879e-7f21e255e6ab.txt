Statement on Signing a Bill Authorizing the Transfer of Juvenile Delinquents to Local Jurisdictions.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I have today signed the bill authorizing the transfer of the cases of juvenile delinquents from the Federal system of criminal justice to juvenile courts in their home communities, provided these juvenile courts are willing to accept them. This measure is an important step forward in that it sets an example through its recognition by the Federal Government of the principle that even the relatively small number of juveniles in the Federal system should be handled on a modern scientific basis. It is also a recognition by the Federal Government of the juvenile court as the proper place for the handling of the cases of all juveniles, and is an acceptance of the principle that juvenile offenders are the product of and the responsibility of their home communities.
"This step was recommended in one of the reports of the National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement, was included in the recommendations in the President's message to Congress, and has had the active interest and approval of social workers all over the country."
Note: As enacted, H.R. 10598, approved June 11, 1932, is Public, No. 169 (47 Stat. 301 ).
