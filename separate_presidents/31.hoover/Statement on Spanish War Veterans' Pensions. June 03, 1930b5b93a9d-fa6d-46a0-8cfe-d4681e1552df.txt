June 03, 1930

Statement on Spanish War Veterans' Pensions.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I favored a liberalizing of the Spanish War veterans' pensions because they have not been on a parity with other services, but I have not changed my opinion that it should have been worked out in such a way that rich men, or men having substantial incomes, should not draw pensions from the Government. I have made no suggestion at any time of a pauper provision against veterans or anything akin thereto.
"I do not believe we should alter the principles which have been held for Civil War veterans all these 70 years, requiring that men claiming Pensions should have at least 90-days' service.
"Further than this, I do not believe it is right to change our national policy and to call upon the Nation to pay disability allowances to men who have or who may tomorrow destroy their health by vicious habits.
"I have received numerous communications from veterans supporting these views."
Note: The President vetoed the Spanish War veterans' pension bill on May 28, 1930. On June 2, the Congress voted to override the President's veto.
