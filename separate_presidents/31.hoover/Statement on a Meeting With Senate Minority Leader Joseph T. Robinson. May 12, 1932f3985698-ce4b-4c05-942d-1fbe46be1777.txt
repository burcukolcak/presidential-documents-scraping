Statement on a Meeting With Senate Minority Leader Joseph T. Robinson.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"At a conference this morning, the President and Senator Robinson canvassed the plan of Senator Robinson and the plans of the President to provide for relief and to stimulate enlarged employment. Methods were considered of combining, simplifying, and putting into concrete form the different proposals so as to secure united nonpartisan and immediate action and not to delay completion of the work at this session.
"The President expressed his high appreciation of Senator Robinson's action in opening the way for unified action and his confidence that a solution will be found. It was agreed that the prerequisite of any plan is balancing of the budget."
Note: On May 11, 1932, Senator Robinson had delivered a major address proposing the issuance of $2,300 million in Federal bonds, the proceeds to be used for relief and self-liquidating public works. The plan had been developed in collaboration with Bernard Baruch.
The White House issued the statement following a morning meeting between the President, Senator Robinson, Secretary of the Treasury Ogden L. Mills, and Directors of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.
