Statement on the Death of Ambassador Myron T. Herrick.
I HAVE heard with profound regret of the death of Myron T. Herrick, our Ambassador in Paris. Few men in American public life have given, during many years, such unselfish and such valuable service to their country. From 1903 to 1906 Mr. Herrick served most successfully as Governor of Ohio. He was appointed Ambassador to France in February 1912, serving until November 1914. During the first year of the war he won the admiration and affection of France by remaining at his post in Paris when the Government and the diplomatic corps moved to Bordeaux. He was reappointed Ambassador in April 1921, since which time he has been an admirable representative of his country.
Mr. Herrick's death will cause sorrow both at home and abroad. The French loved him for his sympathetic understanding, but realized that during his long service in Paris he never lost any of his love for his own country and therefore never failed in his representative capacity. I grieve for the death of a friend and for the passing of a splendid public servant.
