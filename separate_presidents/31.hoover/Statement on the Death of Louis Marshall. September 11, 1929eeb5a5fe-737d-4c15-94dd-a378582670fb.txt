Statement on the Death of Louis Marshall.
I AM deeply grieved to learn that my friend Louis Marshall has passed away. His eminent services in law, government, conciliation, and [p.283] philanthropy will remain of enduring value to this country. His Jewish brethren will long gratefully remember his successful labors in promoting mutual respect and good will amongst the races. But above all he will linger in memory as a lovable man and a loyal friend.
