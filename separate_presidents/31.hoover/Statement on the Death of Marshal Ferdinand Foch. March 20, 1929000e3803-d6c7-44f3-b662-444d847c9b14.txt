Statement on the Death of Marshal Ferdinand Foch.
I HAVE LEARNED with sincere regret of the death of Marshal Foch. I share the respect and admiration in which he is universally held, but beyond this it was my privilege to be closely associated with him in various activities after the war and in this way to gain perhaps a special insight not only into his ability but also his fine human qualities of straightforwardness, kindness, and modesty. I realize how keenly his loss will be felt by the French people. In this loss they have the full sympathy of our people.
Note: Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France was the supreme commander of the Allied forces on the western front at the end of World War I. He died in Paris on Wednesday, March 20, 1929.
