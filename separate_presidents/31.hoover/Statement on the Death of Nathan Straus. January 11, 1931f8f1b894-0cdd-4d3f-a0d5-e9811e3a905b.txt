Statement on the Death of Nathan Straus.
THE DEATH of Mr. Nathan Straus removes from our national life a venerable figure who will be sadly missed. A Jewish leader whose vision transcended all limits of race or creed, a philanthropist whose benefactions, especially in behalf of children, were of permanent value.
Note: Mr. Straus was a prominent philanthropist and leader of the Zionist movement, especially active in such causes as child health, poor relief, and aid to Palestine.
