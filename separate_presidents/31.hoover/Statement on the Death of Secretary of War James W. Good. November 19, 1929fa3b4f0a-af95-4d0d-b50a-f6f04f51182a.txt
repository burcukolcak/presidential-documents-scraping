Statement on the Death of Secretary of War James W. Good.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"The passing of Secretary Good removes a devoted public official. For most of his mature life he served the Nation, earning the highest esteem for his abilities, his fine integrity and his courageous spirit. But the first thoughts of those who knew and loved him are not of his public service. It is for his loyal and stir-effacing friendship that thousands remember him; and that affectionate association is now broken."
