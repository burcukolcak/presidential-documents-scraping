Statement on the Death of Senator Dwight W. Morrow.
THE COUNTRY has suffered a great loss in the death of Senator Dwight Morrow. His character as a neighbor and a friend; his public spirit as a private citizen; his services during the war; his accomplishments as Ambassador to Mexico; his unique contribution to the success of the London Naval Conference--are the record of that sort of an American who makes our country great.
Note: Mr. Morrow served as Ambassador to Mexico from 1927 to 1930 and as Senator of New Jersey from 1930 until this death.
