Statement on the Department of Commerce's Report on Foreign Trade.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I have received from the Department of Commerce preliminary figures on foreign trade for the month of August. They show total imports of $217 million and total exports of about $300 million. The exports show an increase of about $38 million over July.
"The Department has made a study as to how far imports and exports have been affected by the fall in prices as distinguished from actual quantities. During the first 7 months of this year our exports have decreased about 20 percent in quantity and our imports have decreased about 5 percent, indicating that our buying power has held up much better than that of foreign countries." -
