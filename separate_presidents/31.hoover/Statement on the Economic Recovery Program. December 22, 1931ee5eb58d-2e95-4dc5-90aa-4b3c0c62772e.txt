Herbert Hoover
December 22, 1931

Statement on the Economic Recovery Program.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"Leaders of both Houses have assured me that Congress will devote itself to the economic emergency program which I have proposed for the amelioration of agricultural, unemployment, and credit situations. I had urged that the proposed congressional holidays should be shortened but leaders have informed me that they do not believe it possible to secure a quorum before January 4. They assure me, however, that the measures which are uncompleted before the holidays will receive immediate attention after reconvening, and I am assured that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation will be the first to receive consideration and that it has sufficient support to be passed by the Congress."
