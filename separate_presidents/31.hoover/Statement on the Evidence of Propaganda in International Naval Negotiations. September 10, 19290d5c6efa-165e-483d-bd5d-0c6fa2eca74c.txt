Statement on the Evidence of Propaganda in International Naval Negotiations.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"The disclosures of interference with and propaganda against the efforts of the Government in its negotiations of international agreement for reduction of naval armament are already so evident as to require that these matters should be gone into to the very bottom."
Note: On the same day, the White House released a letter to the President from the president of Bethlehem Steel Corporation on the recent disclosures (see Item 193 note.)
