Herbert Hoover
May 13, 1932

Statement on the Lindbergh Kidnaping.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I have directed the law enforcement agencies and the several secret services of the Federal Government to make the kidnaping and murder of the Lindbergh baby a live and never to be forgotten case, never to be relaxed until those criminals are implacably brought to justice. The Federal Government does not have police authority in such crimes, but its agencies will be unceasingly alert to assist the New Jersey police in every possible way until this end has been accomplished."
Note: On the night of March 1, 1932, Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr., 20-month old son of the famed aviator, was abducted from the Lindbergh home near Hopewell, N.J. On May 12, the boy's body was found in a wooded area less than 5 miles from the home.
