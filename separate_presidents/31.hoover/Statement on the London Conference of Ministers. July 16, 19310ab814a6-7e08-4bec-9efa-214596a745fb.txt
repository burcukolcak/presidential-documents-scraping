Statement on the London Conference of Ministers.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"As has already been announced, Secretary Stimson will attend the Conference in London which has been called by the British Government for Monday to consider the present emergency problems in Central Europe. I have asked Secretary Mellon, if consistent with his plans, also to attend in order that we may have the benefit of his advice as well.
"It is our understanding that the Conference is limited entirely to questions of the present emergency."
