Statement on the London Naval Conference.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I am sure the whole Nation bids Godspeed to the American delegation that leaves tomorrow for the London Naval Arms Conference. The people and the governments of the five nations assembling at this meeting are sincerely desirous that agreement shall be brought about by which competition in construction of naval arms is brought to an end, and by which actual reduction in naval burdens of the world shall be accomplished. The difficulties of finding a basis that will be acceptable to five different nations are great, but they are not insuperable.
"The conclusions of the Conference must be such as to give a sense of security and satisfaction to each of the nations. Permanent peace is never based on either taking advantage of or accepting a position of prejudice.
"The technology and the complexities of the problem are such that we need hope for no immediate and quick results. To complete the Conference in 3 or 4 months would be, in itself, a great accomplishment, and we should not expect any hurried conclusions. It is the most important of international conferences of a great many years, and probably the most important for many years to come. The progress of peace for the world rests in a great measure upon the shoulders of the five delegations. There is good will toward the Conference on the part of every nation. The importance and the gravity of the occasion have been recognized in the dispatch to London of the leading men of every country. They have the will to succeed.
"I hope that the people of our country will cooperate in the progress of the Conference by patience, encouragement, and freedom from criticism. We go to London in a fine atmosphere of international good will, and it is the duty of our country to preserve that atmosphere so far as lies within our power."
