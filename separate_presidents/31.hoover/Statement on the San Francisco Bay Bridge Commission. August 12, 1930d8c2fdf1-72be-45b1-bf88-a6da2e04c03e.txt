Statement on the San Francisco Bay Bridge Commission.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"The fifth of the commissions that have been appointed to determine the fact and to advise upon or negotiate special problems has now completed its report and secured a very admirable result. After several years of delay in settlement of a site for a much needed bridge across San Francisco Bay, due to disagreements between the naval authorities, the Army engineers, the municipal and State authorities, the Commission, representing all of these agencies, under the chairmanship of Mr. Mark L. Requa, has now come to unanimous agreement, and appears to have found a solution which has commended itself in all directions, and a much needed improvement may now be carried forward. The bridge will be constructed by local authorities. It involves no participation by the Federal Government other than the granting of certain rights-of-way."
Note: Under the agreement, the route of the bridge would be from Rincon Hill in San Francisco to Goat Island, the naval base in San Francisco Bay, and then to Oakland via Key Mole.
