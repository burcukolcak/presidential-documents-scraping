Statement on the Treaty for the Limitation and Reduction of Naval Armament.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"It is my understanding that the advocates of the naval treaty in the Senate are earnestly striving for action in the present session. If it should prove impossible to complete it at the regular session I shall call a special session of the Senate immediately following the regular session to deal with the question.
"The leaders in the Senate have been consulted and are in agreement with this program."
