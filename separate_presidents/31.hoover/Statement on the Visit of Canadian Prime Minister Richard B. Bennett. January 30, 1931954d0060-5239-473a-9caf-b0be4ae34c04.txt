Statement on the Visit of Canadian Prime Minister Richard B. Bennett.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"I have been very glad to welcome today the Canadian Premier upon his informal visit to Washington. We have no formal matters under discussion. We are mutually interested in the common welfare of our peoples. Informal conversations on problems of the future always lead to better understanding. I consider it a great compliment that Mr. Bennett has found it possible to come to Washington."
Note: The Canadian Prime Minister arrived in Washington, D.C., on January 30, 1931, dined with the President that evening, and spent the next 2 days in informal conferences. The chief item of discussion was the projected St. Lawrence Seaway.
