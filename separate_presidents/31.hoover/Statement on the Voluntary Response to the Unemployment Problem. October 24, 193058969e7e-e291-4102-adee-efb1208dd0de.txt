Statement on the Voluntary Response to the Unemployment Problem.
THE PRESIDENT said:
"No special session is necessary to deal with employment. The sense of voluntary organization and community service in the American people has not vanished. The spirit of voluntary service has been strong enough to cope with the problem for the past year, and it will, I am confident, continue in full measure of the need.
"Colonel [Arthur] Woods is receiving most gratifying evidence of this from the Governors, mayors, industrial leaders, and welfare organizations throughout the country."
