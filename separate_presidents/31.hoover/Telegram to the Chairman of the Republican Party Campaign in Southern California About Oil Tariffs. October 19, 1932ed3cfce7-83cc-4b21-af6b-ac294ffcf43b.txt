Telegram to the Chairman of the Republican Party Campaign in Southern California About Oil Tariffs.
[Released October 19, 1932. Dated October 18, 1932]
I HAVE your telegram stating that Democratic agents despite all proof to the contrary are still circulating misleading statements through the oil fields that I have been opposed to relief to the oil industry because of my supposed interest in foreign oil and that I opposed the tariff on oil. This is usual type of politics. I have not in fifteen years since I entered public service had a dime's interest outside of the United States of any kind including oil. I supported the oil tariff in revenue bill and signed that bill. Without the support I gave I do not believe it would have received sufficient vote from non oil sections to have been carried.

[C. C. Teague, Santa Paula, California ]
Note: Mr. Teague had reported that California oil workers were receiving political pamphlets charging that the President had opposed an oil tariff because of his interest in foreign oil wells.
