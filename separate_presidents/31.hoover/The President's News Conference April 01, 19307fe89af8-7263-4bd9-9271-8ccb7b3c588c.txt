The President's News Conference
15TH DECENNIAL CENSUS
THE PRESIDENT. The census starts tomorrow, that is, the decennial enumeration of the whole of the 120 millions of people, and I am very much in hopes that the whole country will cooperate in making it expeditious and effective. The values which flow from the census taking are of paramount importance both from a point of view of government, economic advancement, social determinations, and every person in the country has an interest in making it absolutely effective. It furnishes a datum point from which we move in every advancement of the country. Other than that I have no information for today.
Q. Mr. President, may I ask you about the White House enumeration-do you furnish the information or does Mrs. Hoover ?
THE PRESIDENT. I think I will furnish it as the head of the family.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and first news conference was held in the State, War, and Navy Building at 12 noon on Tuesday, April 1, 1930.
