The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I have two questions--one on Honduras and the other on Nicaragua.
HONDURAS
On Honduras we have no news other than what you have already in the press this morning.
NICARAGUAN BANDIT ACTIVITY
On Nicaragua our advices are that the Nicaraguan Government has now placed in the field a total of something over 1,300 men in the newly organized National Guard in a drive to clean up [Augusto Cesar] Sandino and his fellow bandits. Our representatives also advise that this force is several times the size of Mr. Sandino's group. His raids on important points have been frustrated by the disposition which has been made of the guard and the protection of our citizens on the coast has been doubly sure by the presence of naval vessels.
Sandino placed himself and his band outside the civilized pale by the coldblooded murder of eight or nine American citizens and many Nicaraguans at isolated places in the interior. The Nicaraguan Government has shown itself fully cognizant of its responsibilities. It is moving vigorously in spite of the difficulties created by the earthquake. It may require some time to accomplish their purpose due to the mountainous and jungle character of the territory in which Sandino operates, but I am perfectly confident that Sandino will be brought to justice.

Otherwise than that I have no news.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and eighty-seventh news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, April 21, 1931.
The President referred to a revolt in Honduras, which had begun on April 18, under the leadership of Gen. Gregoria Ferrera.
On the same day, the White House issued a text of the President's statement on the disturbance in Nicaragua (see Item 141).
