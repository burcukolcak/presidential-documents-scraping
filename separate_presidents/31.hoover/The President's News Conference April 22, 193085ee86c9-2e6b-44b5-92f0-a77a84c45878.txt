The President's News Conference
LONDON NAVAL TREATY
THE PRESIDENT. After consultation with the various leaders we have determined to send up the Naval Arms Treaty immediately upon its receipt here in Washington. The treaty will be brought over by the delegation.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF WAR
My other piece of news is the appointment of Mr. Frederick Huff Payne of Massachusetts as Assistant Secretary of War. We will give you a little biography outside to help you out.
Otherwise than that I have nothing.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and fifth news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, April 22, 1930.
On the same day, the White House issued biographical data on Mr. Payne.
