The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. We have expedited the public works program or authorized program by some 12 million over and above the annual expenditure. The amount appeared in the last deficiency bill. Altogether the Government is meeting the situation one way or another by increasing its program for construction by somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 to 125 million. But a considerable part of the--of these activities is through expanding employment.

That is all I have.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and seventh news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, April 29, 1930.
