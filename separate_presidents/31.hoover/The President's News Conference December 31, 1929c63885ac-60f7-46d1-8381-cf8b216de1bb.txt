The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I haven't anything of a news character today
NEW YEAR'S GREETINGS TO THE PRESS
I want to take this occasion to wish you all a happy new year, and to express my appreciation for the fine cooperation that I have had during this 8 months from all of you. The job is difficult enough, as you know, of maintaining a press relationship, and it is one in which I am in hopes we have established complete confidence with you, and I know it is one in which I have complete confidence on my side. We have tried to experiment now for about 8 months, a rather fundamental line of at least a departure from previous months, and I think it has worked out satisfactorily. We have difficulties at times, but nevertheless I have fine cooperation on your side, and I want to express that feeling to you and to wish you the happiest new year.
Note: President Hoover's seventy-eighth news conference was held in the State, War, and Navy Building at 12 noon on Tuesday, December 31, 1929.
