The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I always feel like apologizing when you all come here and I haven't anything to tell you, but that is the case today. I have nothing that I can properly comment on at the present moment, so I have nothing for you this morning.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and seventy-sixth news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, February 24, 1931.
