The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I haven't anything for publication this morning. I have one or two questions on prohibition that I don't mind talking to you a little about from the point of view of background, but I don't care to enter into any public discussions on the subject at the present time.
STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT
The questions I have relate to the matter of State enforcement. There is nothing in the program which has been proposed here that has any intention of taking over the responsibilities of the States in any shape or form. Our proposals are merely to correct the deficits in our administrative machinery, and are purely Federal. We have no notion of relieving the States of responsibilities or extending the Federal activities beyond their proper relationships with the States.
And that covers all the questions I have, so that is all I can give you today.
Q. Is there any proposal, Mr. President, to increase the responsibilities of the States?
THE PRESIDENT. That matter has not been taken up at all. It no doubt will come up in the Law Enforcement Commission, as they are considering everything. I have no doubt they will have that under consideration in time if they have not already--that I do not know.
Note: President Hoover's eighty-second news conference was held in the State, War, and Navy Building at 12 noon on Tuesday, January 14, 1930.
