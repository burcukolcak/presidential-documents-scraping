The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I am sorry to say that I haven't got a single particle of news of any sort or kind at the present time. You know more about things that are going on than I do, so I can't help. That is about all there is to it.
Note: President Hoover's eighty-third news conference was held in the State, War, and Navy Building at 4 p.m. on Friday, January 17, 1930.
