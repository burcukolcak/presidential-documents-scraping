Herbert Hoover
July 11, 1930

The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I think I have done my share on print for tomorrow morning already.
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE LONDON NAVAL TREATY
There are just one or two matters in the background of this question of documentation to the Senate solely for your own information. There seems to be some misunderstanding as to the character of the documentation. It consists mostly of opinions of not only our own officials in different capacities but the opinions which they have secured from other officials of foreign governments on these problems--often enough their views on the attitudes of officials in other governments and views as to public opinion and public questions in connection with treaties of this kind. It represents a lot of material which may be reliable and some of it unreliable. It also includes a lot of tentative suggestions that came up from different quarters of the world as to methods of handling specific problems, some of which are serious and some of which are not. All of it involves somebody's name and somebody's position, and a great many of them officials of other governments, as well as our own. And there is no explosive material from General Dawes, as has been commonly rumored--nothing of that character in it.
SHIPPING ADVISORY BOARD
I have one other question, as to the new Advisory Board in shipping questions. The Board assembled this morning, and the Shipping Board has provided them with offices and arranged for full cooperation with them, and I am in hopes they will get ahead rapidly with their work.
Otherwise, I think I have made enough contribution from the White House for today.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and twenty-fifth news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, July 11, 1930.
In his remarks, the President referred to Charles G. Dawes, United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James.
