The President's News Conference
UNITED STATES SHIPPING BOARD
THE PRESIDENT. Some questions have been up before the Shipping Board and the administration for the last year in respect to the sale of some of the transatlantic shipping lines, and in order to determine what course should be pursued I have asked the Shipping Board, or have sent to the Shipping Board today a suggestion that I would appoint some outstanding men to investigate the whole of the questions involved and advise on it. I will give to you a copy of the letter to the Board, which explains itself.
And today I have sent Mr. [Edward C.] Plummer's name up for reappointment on the Board.
NAVY SELECTION BOARD
And I have approved the recommendation of the Navy Selection Board for eight admirals, and various captains and commanders, a list of which will be given to you.

I have no other news than that.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and sixteenth news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, June 6, 1930.
On the same day, the White House issued the list of the Navy Selection Board recommendations.
