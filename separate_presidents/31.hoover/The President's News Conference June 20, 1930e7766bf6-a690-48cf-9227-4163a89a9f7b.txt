Herbert Hoover
June 20, 1930

The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I would like to have a little more inspiration from your side on things I can talk about.
APPOINTMENTS
I have only two questions--regarding the Tariff Commission and the Power Commission. There will be some changes in the personnel of the Tariff Commission, and the whole Power Commission, of course, is to be appointed. And I am in hopes of being able to have all those changes in front of the Senate before they finally leave Washington.

So I am rather short of material to discuss at the present moment.
Q. Could you indicate, Mr. President, how extensive the changes in the Tariff Commission will be ?
THE PRESIDENT. I haven't decided that yet. We will have some changes, but I haven't decided what they will be.
Q. About the sailfish, Mr. President, is that something new ?
THE PRESIDENT. That just came in brand new. It is an unpleasant reminder of pleasant things.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and twentieth news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, June 20, 1930.
As a surprise, Mrs. Hoover had new furnishings installed in the President's office during the previous evening. A large silver replica of a sailfish appeared on his desk serving as a reminder of 'pleasant times and pleasant days.
