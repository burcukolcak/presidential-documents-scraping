The President's News Conference
WHITE HOUSE PRESS RELATIONS
THE PRESIDENT. I haven't anything this morning. I want to take this occasion to thank you for your many courtesies during the last year, and to make the suggestion that perhaps your committee should consider the press relations of the White House from the beginning of the administration. You might have a session and see if you have anything to suggest that might be helpful on your side and mine. We have had a year's experience with it now. Some things do not work out as well as they might and other things better than could be expected.
In any event, it might be worthwhile reconsidering the whole setup. If there is no change that the committee thinks could be made, why it is all right with me.
So, again I want to thank you for the many courtesies that I have had from the press and the very agreeable relationship on my side. We do not always agree on things, but people that have a sense of sportsmanship in the world always agree to disagree and let it go at that.

Thank you.
Note: President Hoover's ninety-fourth news conference was held in the State, War, and Navy Building at 12 noon on Tuesday, March 4, 1930.
