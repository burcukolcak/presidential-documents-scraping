The President's News Conference
FEDERAL FARM BOARD
THE PRESIDENT. I have to announce to you something that I think you all know, and that is Mr. [Alexander] Legge's resignation. And I know that I reflect the view of the agricultural community when I express intense regret that his private affairs have made it necessary for him to leave the Board. He has been urged I think by every farm organization in the United States to continue as Chairman of the Farm Board, and I have urged him with all the pressures that I could bring to bear, but he feels obligations elsewhere.
I have appointed Mr. James C. Stone as the Chairman of the Board, and Mr. [Charles C.] Teague has been elected Vice Chairman. We, therefore, have a vacancy on the Board which will require some 2 or 3 weeks to fill.
RICHARD N. ELLIOTT
I have given an interim appointment to Congressman Elliott as Assistant Comptroller General.

And that is all the news I have got today.
ALEXANDER LEGGE
Q. Mr. President, does that resignation take effect immediately ?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and seventy-eighth news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, March 6, 1931.
Richard N. Elliott served as Representative from Indiana from 1917 until his appointment as Assistant Comptroller General.
