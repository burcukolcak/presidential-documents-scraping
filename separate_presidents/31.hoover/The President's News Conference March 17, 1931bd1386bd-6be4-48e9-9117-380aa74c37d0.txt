The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I haven't anything for you this morning at all, I am sorry to say. I have just said that part of you, at least, will have a chance to get seasick for the next 3 days to see whether you can find any news out of that. Otherwise than the fact that we are going, I haven't got anything to give you.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and eightieth news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, March 17, 1931.
The President referred to his forthcoming tour to Porto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
