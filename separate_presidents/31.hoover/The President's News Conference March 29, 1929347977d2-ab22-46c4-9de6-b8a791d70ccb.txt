The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. There is no use getting out your paper because the only questions I have today relate to matters that I am unable to make any announcement about.
ARMS LIMITATION CONFERENCE
I have one question on instructions to limitation of arms conference. That also must be delayed until Mr. Stimson can say something about it himself.
So I am dry of anything, and it is your fault
THE PRESIDENT'S WEEKEND PLANS
Q. Mr. President, are you going to take a little trip on Saturday ?
THE PRESIDENT. The family wants to go on a picnic tomorrow, and we thought we would go up into the Shenandoah hills--back tomorrow night.
POSTMASTER APPOINTMENTS
Q. Mr. President, can you tell us if you are giving any consideration to the issuance of [an] Executive order for postmaster appointments such as Mr. Wilson 1 issued?
THE PRESIDENT. No, not at the present time--haven't come to any conclusions about that.
So I am sorry that I cannot give you some warranty for this appearance.
Note: President Hoover's eighth news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, March 29, 1929.
