The President's News Conference
FEDERAL TAXES AND SPENDING
THE PRESIDENT. I have canvassed the financial situation in the Government exhaustively with our different departments, and I can state that there will be no increases in taxes if the next Congress imposes no increases on the budget or the expenditure proposals which the administration will present. But for Congress to do this the people must cooperate to effectively discourage and postpone the consideration of demands of sectional and group interest.
WILLIAM R. CASTLE, JR.
I have to announce that Mr. Castle will be the new Under Sectary of State.
ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT
Mr. [French] Strother will by the first of June have completed the 2 years for which he agreed to come to the White House, and he will be returning to his work, much to our regret. In the meantime, Mr. Joslin will carry on, at least for sometime to come--carry on Mr. Strother's work as well as his own.
EARTHQUAKE IN MANAGUA, NICARAGUA
The flash has just come in that Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, has been destroyed by an earthquake and is now burning up. I have directed the Red Cross to take the matter in hand at once, and the Army and Navy will cooperate with them.

Further than that I have no news.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and eighty-third news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, March 31, 1931.
On the same day, the White House issued a text of the President's statement on Federal taxes and expenditures (see Item 117).Theodore G. Joslin was Secretary to the President.
Managua, Nicaragua was struck by an earthquake at 10:02 a.m. on March 31, 1931. An estimated 1,000 people were killed, and 25,000 were left homeless. On April 3, relief and rehabilitation operations were organized under a Central Relief Committee, composed of Americans and Nicaraguans, headed by Matthew E. Hanna, American Minister to Nicaragua.
