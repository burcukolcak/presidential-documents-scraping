The President's News Conference
APPOINTMENT OF DWIGHT F. DAVIS
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I have within the last hour had a telegram from Mr. Dwight Davis, saying that he would accept the Governor Generalship of the Philippines, and he will be appointed.
TACNA-ARICA DISPUTE
The Tacna-Arica dispute has been settled.1 The State Department told me a few minutes ago that they would have the whole of the documentation ready for you, they thought, at 4 o'clock, so that you can get it from them. I have nothing to add to the particular publication of it, and there is no particular background to it so far as I know except that after some 7 or 8 years it is settled.
I think that is all I have got on my mind.
1 A longstanding dispute between Chile and Peru over possession of the provinces of Tacna and Arica was settled on the basis of a compromise suggested by Mr. Hoover after his preinaugural tour of Central and South America.
Note: President Hoover's twenty-second news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, May 17, 1929.
