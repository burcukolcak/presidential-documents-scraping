The President's News Conference
THE O'FALLON DECISION AND RAILWAY RATES
THE PRESIDENT. I have some questions about the effect of the O'Fallon decision, and you can say, if you wish, that I am confident that there will be no increase in railway rates as the result of the O'Fallon decision.
LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMISSION
I also have some questions about the meeting of the Law Enforcement Commission. I have asked the Commission to meet at the Cabinet Room here at 2:30 next Tuesday afternoon. [p.149] That comprises my entire budget.
The Commission will meet for organization purposes and hope to get under way with its work promptly.
Q. Mr. President, do you suppose the Commission will have a series of meetings here ?
THE PRESIDENT. The Commission will determine that. I cannot forecast how they will do their work.
RAILWAY RATES
Q. Mr. President, is that statement on the railway rates for quotation ?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes, if you like. I would like to have you get it accurately.
"I am confident there will be no increase in railway rates as the result of the O'Fallon decision."
