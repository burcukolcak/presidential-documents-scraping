The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I have a number of inquiries from you gentlemen upon contentious questions, but the job for the country to concentrate on now is further measures of cooperation for economic recovery. And that is the only suggestion I have for you on this occasion.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and fifty-second news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, November 7, 1930. On the same day, the White House also issued a text of the President's statement.
This was the first news conference following the midterm elections held on November 4, 1930. Returns at the time indicated that the Democrats had made major gains, winning 18 of the 32 gubernatorial contests, 22 of the 36 contests for Senate seats, and 216 of the 431 contests for seats in the House of Representatives.
