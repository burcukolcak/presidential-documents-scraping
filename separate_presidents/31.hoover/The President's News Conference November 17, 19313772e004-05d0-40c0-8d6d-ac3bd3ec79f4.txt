The President's News Conference
UNITED STATES TARIFF COMMISSION
THE PRESIDENT. I have this morning Mr. [Henry P.] Fletcher's resignation as Chairman of the Tariff Commission. You have already been advised of this, but he attaches to his letter a complete report of the work of the Commission to date showing that by November 30 the docket will be clear of all applications and all Senate references, and we will have it mimeographed and given to you today.

Q. Mr. President, when does he officially leave ?
THE PRESIDENT. The end of this month.
ITALIAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
As you know Mr. Grandi has arrived. He is a national guest and I have some conversations with him beginning at 4 this afternoon, in conjunction with Secretary of State Stimson.
HOME LOAN DISCOUNT BANKS
The only other item here is the continuous flood of telegrams concerning the mortgage discount bank which are coming from every town and village in the United States. That, of course, is not of so much interest to you for publication, but it is an interesting phenomenon that it has received such extraordinary universal support.

Other than that I have nothing this morning.
ITALIAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Q. Will you have conversations with Mr. Grandi tomorrow ?
THE PRESIDENT. I don't know yet.
Note: President Hoover's two hundred and twenty-second news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, November 17, 1931.
Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dino Grandi arrived in the United States on November 16, 1931.
On the same day, the White House issued the texts of representative letters and telegrams of endorsements of the Federal home loan discount bank system.
