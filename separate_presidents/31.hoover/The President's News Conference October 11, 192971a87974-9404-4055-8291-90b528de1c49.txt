The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I thought your burdens had been fairly heavy this week, and I would not add much to them today. I haven't anything for you.
I have one question relating to the Army and Navy game, which is on the lighter side of life, and I may say that I hope that the Army and Navy combatants(?)1 will be able to come to an agreement and to resume the game. I will add nothing about internal warfare or anything like that.
1 ?The question mark appears in the transcript.
Q. Mr. President, are you contemplating making any trip other than this week out into the West [p.323]
THE PRESIDENT. Not at all--no notion of any other trip before Christmas, and I have no notion of anything afterwards. That was just by way of fixing the date as a certainty. That is all I have today. You have all worked hard this week, so I won't add anything this week.
Note: President Hoover's fifty-seventh news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, October 11, 1929.
