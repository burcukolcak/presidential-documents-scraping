The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I am sorry, but this is one of those days when I haven't anything that I can very well discuss.
I have one or two questions, but I am not quite ready with the data behind them, so that I can't make a competent statement on them. And you seem to be able to find a supply of news elsewhere.
DEATH OF SENATOR THEODORE F. BURTON
Q. Mr. President, are we to look for a statement from you on Senator Burton ?
THE PRESIDENT. I just sent one. So I am afraid I can't help you any this morning.
Q. Mr. President, are you going to the funeral service for Senator Burton at the Capitol tomorrow ?
THE PRESIDENT. Yes.
Note: President Hoover's sixty-first news conference was held in the White House at 12 noon on Tuesday, October 29, 1929.
