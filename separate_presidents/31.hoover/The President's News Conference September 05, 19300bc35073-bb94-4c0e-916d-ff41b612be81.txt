The President's News Conference
FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD
THE PRESIDENT. There is certainly a dearth of news here today. I have only one item and that is the appointment of Eugene Meyer as Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, and the resignation of Mr. [Edmund] Plait, who has hitherto represented the New York District on the Board. Mr. Plait has been wanting for some time to retire and get into private business. Therefore, Mr. Meyer will come on the Board at once.
We have one more member to choose on the Board and you already have the list of the districts from which he can be chosen so you can excite all those districts about it

Q. Mr. President, will you be going away this weekend
THE PRESIDENT. I don't think so.
Note: President Hoover's one hundred and thirty-eighth news conference was held in the White House at 4 p.m. on Friday, September 5, 1930.
On the same day, the White House also issued a text of the President's statement about appointments to the Federal Reserve Board (see Item 285).
