Veto of a Bill for the Relief of Alexander M. Proctor.
To the Senate:
I return herewith Senate Bill 2179, An Act for the relief of Alexander M. Proctor.
I am advised that this bill would not operate to change the records of the War Department nor would it authorize the issue of a certificate of honorable discharge to Alexander M. Proctor, but that under its provisions Mr. Proctor would be entitled to a pension at the rate of $50 (maximum) per month under the act of March 3, 1927, known as the Indian War Pension Act. The relief appealed for by Mr. Proctor is for a change in his military record to an honorable discharge. This the bill does not accomplish. I am assured also that Mr. Proctor neither desires nor needs a pension. Therefore, I am returning the bill without my approval.

The White House,

Note: The Senate referred the bill to the Committee on Military Affairs and no further action was taken.
Mr. Proctor had received a dishonorable discharge in 1875 following the discovery that he had misrepresented his age when enlisting.
