Letter on Trade to Governor General Frank Murphy of the Philippine Islands.
My dear Governor General:
As you know, consideration is being given by this Government to the question of future relations between the United States and the Philippines. These relations have been the subject of conferences which you and I have had during your visit in Washington. As a result of these discussions I contemplate calling the joint trade conference provided for in Section 13 of the Tydings-McDuffie Act at as early a date as practicable after the inauguration of the Commonwealth Government, in order that effective measures for promoting mutual trade advantages between the two countries may be given early consideration.
To facilitate the work of the conference I have asked our Interdepartmental Committee to continue studies already begun Â· so that the necessary basic material will be available when the conference convenes. I trust you will also be able to inaugurate similar studies in the Philippine Islands which will provide pertinent data' for consideration by the conference.
Sincerely yours,

Governor General Frank Murphy,

Washington, D. C.
