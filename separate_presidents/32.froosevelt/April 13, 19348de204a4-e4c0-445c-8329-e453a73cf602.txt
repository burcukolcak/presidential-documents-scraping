Letter on the Freedom of the Press.
My dear Mr. Connolly:
A press association, collecting and disseminating news, enjoys a prominent place and exercises a tremendous influence in its field of operations. That it has functioned always without fear or favor, exercising the responsibilities for clean, factual and intelligent reporting, should be a matter of great pride to its builders, and its world-wide staff of workers.
I do not believe it would be amiss here for me to say that I personally find high satisfaction in the knowledge that it is possible in this land of ours for anyone to establish a newspaper or a news service and to enjoy the freedom of operation guaranteed by our fathers and which, I am glad to say, still prevails. I am glad, too, that our Government never has seen fit to subsidize a newspaper or a news service and I dare to make the prediction that it never will.
Very sincerely yours,
Mr. Joseph V. Connolly,
President, International News Service, Inc.,
New York, N. Y.
