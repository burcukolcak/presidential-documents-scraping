Message to the Senate on General Pulaski's Memorial Day.
To the Senate:
I return herewith Senate Joint Resolution 21, "Authorizing the President to proclaim October 11th of each year General Pulaski's Memorial Day for the observance and commemoration of the death of Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski," without approval.
I take special note that this proclamation would be made an annual event.
Every American should have the deepest appreciation of the brilliant and gallant services of General Pulaski in the Revolutionary War. His devotion to duty ended only when he fell in action in the service of the Republic; he is one of our heroes of that time and of all time.
General Pulaski was distinguished among the noble company of those who gave their all for that cause; some were Americans; some were from countries across the sea. I do not think that General Pulaski would have wished to be singled out from his fellows and comrades for more honor than we can give to them all. Our tributes to the memory of the officers who served on the staff of General Washington will be the more fitting and appropriate if we do not seek to legislate separate memorial days for each of them, however illustrious they may be.
For our own leader of the American Revolution, the greatest of Americans, and for him alone, have we as a people set apart one day each year.
