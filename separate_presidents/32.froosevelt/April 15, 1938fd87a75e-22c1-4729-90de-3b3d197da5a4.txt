Executive Order 7868â€”Transfer of Jurisdiction Over Certain Lands from the Secretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the Interior
Whereas certain lands, together with the improvements thereon, largely contiguous or in close proximity to existing Indian Reservations, have been, or are in the process of being, acquired in connection with the projects hereinafter designated, under authority of Title II of the National Industrial Recovery Act of June 16, 1933 (48 Stat. 200), the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of April 8, 1935 (49 Stat. 115), and section 55 of Title I of the act of August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 750, 781; and
Whereas it appears that the transfer of jurisdiction over such lands from the Secretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the Interior for administrative purposes would be in the public interest:
Now, therefore, by virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me under the aforesaid National Industrial Recovery Act, the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, and the act of August 24, 1935, it is hereby ordered that jurisdiction over the lands within the hereinafter-described areas, together with the improvements thereon, acquired or in the process of acquisition by the United States in connection with the hereinafter-designated projects, be, and it is hereby, transferred from the Secretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the Interior: Provided, however, that the Secretary of Agriculture shall retain such jurisdiction over the lands now in process of acquisition by the United States as may be necessary to enable him to complete the purchase of such lands; and the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized (1) to administer, through the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, such lands for the uses for which they were, or are in the process of being, acquired, and, insofar as consistent with such uses, for the benefit of such Indians as he may designate, (2) in connection with the administration of such lands to exercise all powers and functions, insofar as they may relate to these lands, conferred upon the Secretary of Agriculture by Executive Order No. 7530 of December 31, 1936, and Executive Order No. 7557 of February 19, 1937, and (3) to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order:
