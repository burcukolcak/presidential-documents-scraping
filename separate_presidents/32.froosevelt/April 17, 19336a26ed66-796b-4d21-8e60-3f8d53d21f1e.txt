Letter to Mrs. Russell William Magna of the DAR.
My dear Mrs. Magna: It is with very genuine regret that I find it impossible to be with you tonight. Up until six o'clock this evening I had planned to come but an important conference at the White House tonight makes it impossible for me to do so.
Will you convey to all the delegates a greeting from me and express to them my deep appreciation of the loyal and patriotic service they are constantly rendering. Particularly in a time like this the country needs the fine ideals, the loyalty to our national institutions and the willingness to serve which your organization always manifests. Again expressing my regret that I cannot be with you, Sincerely yours, Mrs. Russell William Magna, Daughters of the American Revolution, Washington, D. C.
