Letter to Editors and Publishers on Cooperation from the Press.
To Editor and Publisher:

We have passed another milestone in the life of the Fourth Estate. The press associations, publishers, editors and advertisers are preparing to reassemble for their annual business meetings. The Editor and Publisher, as in the past several years, again offers me the opportunity of extending best wishes to those attending these meetings. This I do, gladly and sincerely.
In the past year, the press as a whole has benefited materially, due to improved conditions. Additional benefits within the coming year are confidently expected.
That these benefits may be broadly expanded until they encompass other interests and people at large, I ask the continued cooperation of the press. I welcome constructive criticism of us in Government and urge that we, together, continue the battle against depression until there is a real national recovery on all fronts.
Very sincerely yours,

Editor and Publisher,

New York, N.Y.
