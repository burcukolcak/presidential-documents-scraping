Withdrawal of the Nomination of Thomas R. Amlie for the Interstate Commerce Commission.
My dear Mr. Amlie:
I have your letter requesting me to withdraw your nomination as a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission. I am doing so shortly.
I deeply regret that a certain type of opposition should deprive the Interstate Commerce Commission of one as able and as wholeheartedly devoted to the public service as you are.
You and I have often differed on important issues, but I can assure you nothing has occurred to alter my belief in your qualifications to serve as a minority member of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Those who for political reasons have called you a Communist do not perhaps realize that such name-calling ill serves the democratic form of Government which this Nation as a whole wishes to continue.
A quarter of a century ago I, too, was called a Communist and a wild-eyed radical because I fought for factory inspection, for a fifty-four-hour-a-week bill for women and children in industry and similar measures. You are still young and I hope that you will continue to work for the improvement of social and economic legislation under our framework of Government.
Very sincerely yours,
Thomas R. Amlie, Esq.,

Washington, D.C.
