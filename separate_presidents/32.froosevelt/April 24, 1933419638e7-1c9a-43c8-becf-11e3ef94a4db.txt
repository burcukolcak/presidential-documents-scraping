Message Regarding the 400th Anniversary of the Birth of William the Silent.
This 400th Anniversary of the birth of William the Silent will be remembered not only by the people of the Netherlands, who owe to him their very existence as a nation, but by those in all parts of the world who cherish the principles of liberty and tolerance for which he labored and for which he gave his life. It is particularly fitting that it should be celebrated in this country. The men who won our independence and established our Government drew inspiration from his ideals and from his example. Indomitable courage in the face of adversity, a wise tenacity of purpose unshaken by conflicting counsels, and an unswerving faith in his countrymen and in the future of his country were his outstanding characteristics. They are characteristics which are needed today. The men and women of this country, in the present crisis in our national life, may find renewed hope and confidence in his noble example.
