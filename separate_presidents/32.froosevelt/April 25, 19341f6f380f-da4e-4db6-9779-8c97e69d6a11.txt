Letter to the United Parents Associations.
My dear Mr. Simon:
Parents and parents' associations occupy a unique position in the evolution and stabilization of our democratic form of government, and in the economic and social development of our country.
The school has been called upon to assume many of the responsibilities which were formerly undertaken by the home. It cannot supplant the home in understanding and bringing out the best in the individual child. It is therefore, as I see it, through these group conferences and meetings of parents that parents may discuss how to preserve the essentials of the home, clarify its functions, and adapt them to changing conditions.
The parents of our children are the guardians of our future citizens. They cannot evade the responsibility which is theirs through example and intelligent understanding to inspire and lay the ground work for that type of character which does what is right under any given circumstance, and is able to withstand temptation.
Parents as citizens might well set up standards for themselves as well as for their children. No group of parents can set itself up as immune from the problems of home and society which confront others. The soundness of our governmental institutions and of our economic system depends largely upon the standards which the majority of our citizens set up, and their desire to achieve them even at the cost of personal sacrifice.
I see great hope for the future in the formation, encouragement and support of parents' associations throughout the land.
Very sincerely yours,
Mr. Robert E. Simon,
Education Chairman of United Parents Associations,
