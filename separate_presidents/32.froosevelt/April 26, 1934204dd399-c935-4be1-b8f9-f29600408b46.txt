Statement on the Settlement of the Railroad Wage Dispute
I am very glad that the railroads and their employees have been able to settle their wage dispute by mutual agreement. The country should be, and will be, grateful to them for this disposition of what might have developed into a troublesome controversy. I congratulate both sides on the wisdom and restraint which they have exhibited. They have set a good example.
