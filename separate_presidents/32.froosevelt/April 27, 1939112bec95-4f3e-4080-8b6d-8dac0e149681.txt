Transmittal to Congress of a Survey on Interterritorial Freight Rates.
To the Congress:
Herewith I submit a survey entitled "Supplemental Phases of the Interterritorial Freight Rate Problem of the United States," which survey was conducted by the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority, pursuant to Executive Order No. 6161 (June 8, 1933), by which are delegated to it certain powers granted to me by sections 22 and 23 of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933.
I am, also, herewith submitting a letter from the Tennessee Valley Authority, dated the sixth day of February, 1939, forwarding the aforesaid survey to me, explaining its relation to the initial report on this subject submitted to the Congress on June 7, 1937, and published as House Document No. 264 (75th Cong., 1st sess.). This letter also restates the views of the Authority on the effects upon our national economy of the regional freight rate discrimination disclosed in the two reports, and urges the adoption of appropriate legislation to eliminate this discrimination.
I invite the attention of the Congress to the suggestion, contained in the Authority's letter, that the report, with its accompanying tables and charts, be published as an official document.
