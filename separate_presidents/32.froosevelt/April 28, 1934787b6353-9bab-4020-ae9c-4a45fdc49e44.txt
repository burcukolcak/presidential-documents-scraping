Letter on Brotherhood Day.
My dear Dr. Ashworth:
I have just learned of the proposed observance of Brotherhood Day by the National Conference of Jews and Christians and I am deeply interested in its possibilities.
This occasion presents an opportunity for concerted thinking on a vital problem of national welfare; it should help us all in our efforts to rise above ancient and harmful suspicions and prejudices and to work together as citizens of American democracy. Good neighborliness, good citizenship and plain common sense in everyday relationships are potential fruits of such a nationwide observance.
Very sincerely yours,
Dr. Robert A. Ashworth,
New York, N.Y.
