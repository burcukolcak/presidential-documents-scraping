Letter to Alben Barkley Urging Equal Opportunity to Exercise the Right to Vote. From U.S.S. Houston.
My dear Alben:
In view of the interest which we all feel in the processes by which public servants are selected throughout the country, as well as the results that flow therefrom, I am taking the liberty of expressing the hope that in your State, without regard to political parties, the greatest freedom and the widest opportunity may be accorded to all the people for participation in the selection of candidates, as well as in their final election.
One of the purposes of the present national Administration in most of its activities is to improve the lot of the men and women whose voices have not always been heard and whose welfare has not always been regarded by those in charge of our Government. The right to equality of treatment under that Government and in the choosing of that Government is inherent in democracy and its denial cannot anywhere be justified.
May I indulge the hope and belief that in your State and in all the States those who are charged with party responsibility will preserve and guarantee these indisputable rights to the people of every class?
Very sincerely yours,
Hon. Alben Barkley,

Washington, D. C.
