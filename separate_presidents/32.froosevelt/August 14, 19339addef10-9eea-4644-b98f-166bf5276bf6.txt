Letter to James A. Moss of the United States Flag Association on their Crusade Against Crime.
My dear Colonel Moss:
I acknowledge with thanks your telegram in which the Steering Committee of the National Council of '76 of The United States Flag Association pledges cooperation to the Department of Justice and assures support in our efforts to free the country of its scourge of frightful crime.
I am deeply interested in and heartily endorse the crusade against crime which the Association is conducting under the sponsorship of its National Council of '76. It is a fine patriotic undertaking of the greatest importance which deserves, and I am confident will receive, the support of all loyal citizens.
Will you please convey to the members of the Steering Committee my deep appreciation of their fine spirit of cooperation?
Very sincerely yours,
[Franklin D. Roosevelt]
Colonel James A. Moss,
President General
The United States Flag Association
Washington, D.C.
