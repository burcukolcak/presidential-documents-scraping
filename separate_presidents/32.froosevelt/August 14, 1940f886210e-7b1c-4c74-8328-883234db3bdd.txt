Letter on Young People Continuing Education Until Called to Service.
My dear Mr. Administrator:
REPORTS have reached me that some young people who had planned to enter college this fall, as well as a number of those who attended college last year, are intending to interrupt their education at this time because they feel that it is more patriotic to work in a shipyard, or to enlist in the Army or Navy, than it is to attend college. Such a decision would be unfortunate.
We must have well-educated and intelligent citizens who have sound judgment in dealing with the difficult problems of today. We must also have scientists, engineers, economists, and other people with specialized knowledge, to plan and to build for national defense as well as for social and economic progress. Young people should be advised that it is their patriotic duty to continue the normal course of their education, unless and until they are called, so that they will be well prepared for greatest usefulness to their country. They will be promptly notified if they are needed for other patriotic services.
Sincerely yours,
The Honorable,
The Administrator,

Federal Security Agency,

Washington, D.C.
