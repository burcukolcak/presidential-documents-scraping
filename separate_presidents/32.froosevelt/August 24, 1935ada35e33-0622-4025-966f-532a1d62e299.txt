Statement on Signing Amendments to the Agricultural Adjustment Act.
This legislation supplements and strengthens the original Agricultural Adjustment Act, enacted May 12, 1933, which unquestionably has been of great value to American farmers. It carries forward the agricultural program on the broad economic basis of the original Act.
The Act as a whole will enable the Agricultural Adjustment Administration to move forward in its constructive and essential work in behalf of agriculture.
