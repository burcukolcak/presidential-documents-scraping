Proclamation 2056â€”National Fire Protection Week-1933
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
It has been a commendable custom for the President of the United States to request the annual observance of Fire Prevention Week throughout the country. It is a week set aside for the purpose of informing the public of the dangers of fire to life and property. Fires which are largely preventable take a cruel toll of many lives and destroy property exceeding $400,000,000 in value each year. Of late, progress has been made in reducing the Nation's fire loss, and this fact should encourage continuous vigilance and alertness so necessary to decrease the hazards of fire.
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning October 8, 1933, to be observed as Fire Prevention Week.
To prevent our enormous waste by fire, the cooperation of all citizens is requested, and the organizations, groups, and individuals interested in fire prevention are asked to take the leadership in instructing the public in the simple precautionary measures advocated as fire prevention safeguards.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Doneat the City of Washington this 28 day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and fifty-eighth.

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
