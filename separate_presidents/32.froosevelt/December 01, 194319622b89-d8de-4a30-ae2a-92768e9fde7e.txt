Veto of a Bill Designating December 7 as Armed Services Honor Day.
To the Senate:
I return herewith, without my approval, Senate Joint Resolution 59, authorizing the President of the United States of America to proclaim Armed Services Honor Day for the recognition and appreciation of the patriotic devotion to duty of all members of all branches of the armed military and naval forces of the United States of America.
The measure designates December 7, 1943, as Armed Services Honor Day and authorizes and requests the President to issue a proclamation commending the observance of that day in honor of all men and women who have served or are now serving in any and all branches of the military and naval armed services of the United States. The measure further requests the Governors of every State to invoke the people's cooperation and urges local governmental units to make plans and hold appropriate ceremonies for proper observation of the occasion in every community.
I consider the commemoration of the day fixed in the measure to be singularly inappropriate. December 7, two years ago, is a day that is remembered in this country as one of infamy on the part of a treacherous enemy. The day itself requires no reminder, and its anniversary should rather serve to cause all the people of the Nation to increase their efforts contributing to the successful prosecution of the war.
Furthermore, it seems to me premature to establish at this time a day to be set aside to honor and commemorate all who have served in the armed forces of the United States during the course of the present war. I think that a more suitable date can be selected for this purpose, and that future events will ordain the proper date for such a commemoration.
For the foregoing reasons, I am constrained to withhold approval of this Resolution. This Joint Resolution was presented to me on November 25, 1943.
