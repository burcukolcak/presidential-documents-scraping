Statement Discouraging the Sale of Airplanes to Belligerents Who Bomb Civilians.
THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT and the American people have for some time pursued a policy of wholeheartedly condemning the unprovoked bombing and machine gunning of civilian populations from the air.
This Government hopes, to the end that such unprovoked bombing shall not be given material encouragement in the light of recent recurrence of such acts, that American manufacturers and exporters of airplanes, aeronautical equipment and materials essential to airplane manufacture will bear this fact in mind before negotiating contracts for the exportation of these articles to nations obviously guilty of such unprovoked bombing.
