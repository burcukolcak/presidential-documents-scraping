Greetings to the American Foundation for the Blind.
I am very happy to know of the ceremony at which you are officiating this afternoon. It is a milestone in the career of an organization, founded on sympathy and understanding, which has served not only to guide those who are without light, but to show the path to their fellow citizens, so that in our worldly progress we may come to recognize our obligation to them, and in the recognition and performance of that obligation benefit ourselves.
