Communique on a Meeting with Churchill and the President of Turkey.
MR. ROOSEVELT, President of the United States of America, M. Ismet Inonu, President of the Turkish Republic, and Mr. Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, met in Cairo on December 4, 5, and 6, 1943.
Mr. Anthony Eden, His Majesty's principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, M. Numan Menemencioglu, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, and Mr. Harry Hopkins took part in their deliberations.
Participation in this conference of the head of the Turkish state, in response to the cordial invitation addressed to him by the United States, British, and Soviet Governments, bears striking testimony to the strength of the alliance which unites Great Britain and Turkey, and to the firm friendship existing between the Turkish people and the United States of America and the Soviet Union.
Presidents Roosevelt and Inonu and Prime Minister Churchill reviewed the general political situation and examined at length the policy to be followed, taking into account the joint and several interests of the three countries.
The study of all problems in a spirit of understanding and loyalty showed that the closest unity existed between the United States of America, Turkey, and Great Britain in their attitude to the world situation.
The conversations in Cairo have consequently been most useful and most fruitful for future relations between the four countries concerned.
The identity of interests and of views of the great American and British democracies with those of the Soviet Union, as also the traditional relations of friendship existing between these powers and Turkey, have been reaffirmed throughout the proceedings of the Cairo Conference.
