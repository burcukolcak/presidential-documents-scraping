Greeting to the Vice-President's Hunting Feast.
Private but not too confidential
Dear Jack:
I have read in the papers that tonight you and twenty-four members of the Senate are attending the funeral of my old friend Bessie. I knew her many years ago when I was hunting in northern Pennsylvania. She was the pet of the camp and would always come when you whistled and eat out of your hand.
I am sorry, indeed, that Joe Guffey removed the tinkling little bell which was always worn around her neck. It makes me feel so chokey when I think of her untimely demise that I do not think that I could attend the funeral service tonight even if I had been invited.
I understand fully, of course, that this unfortunate hunting accident was not your faultâ€”and I am glad, too, that if Bessie had to go you shot her instead of whistling her up and cutting her throat with a knife. Dear Bessie probably never knew what hit her.
Under all the unfortunate circumstances attending her death, I hope, nevertheless, that all of you will enjoy the wake.
As ever yours,
Honorable John N. Garner,

The Vice-President of the United States,

The Raleigh Hotel,

Washington, D.C.
