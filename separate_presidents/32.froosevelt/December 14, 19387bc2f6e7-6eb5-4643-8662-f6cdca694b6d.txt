Letter on Scholarships for Refugees from Germany.
My dear Mr. Lane:
I have received your letter of December 2, 1938, and am deeply interested to note the plans which the President and Corporation of Harvard University and the student body are making to provide for scholarships and support for refugees of all creeds from Germany.
This program appears to be in the best traditions of the University, and I sincerely hope that it will be taken up by other institutions throughout the country.
Very sincerely yours,
Mr. Robert E. Lane,
Harvard Committee To Aid German Student Refugees, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
