A Letter on the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Airplane.
Dear Mr. Wright:
I have noted with keen interest the plans for a nationwide observance tomorrow of the Thirtieth Anniversary of the first flight of man in an airplane.
It is a source of gratification to me to know that it was an American who gave the world mechanical wings, and it is an even greater satisfaction to realize the part that America has taken in the rapid development of this newest and swiftest form of transportation.
Although only thirty years have passed since that eventful day when you made the first actual flight in a heavier-than-air powerdriven vehicle, the airplane has progressed to a point where, today, it is an indispensable unit in our national defense and an exceedingly important adjunct to the commerce of the Nation. I trust and believe that each succeeding year will produce still more important developments, and that with each succeeding future anniversary we will have reason to be even more grateful to the two pioneers who made possible this great industry.
May I add my personal and very sincere congratulations to you on this historic anniversary?

Sincerely yours,

Orville Wright, Esq.,
