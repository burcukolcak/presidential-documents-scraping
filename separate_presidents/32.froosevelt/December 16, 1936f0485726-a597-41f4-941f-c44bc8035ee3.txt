Statement on Return from the Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace.
A very delightful trip has come to an end.
I am made especially happy by the continuing good news from the Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace. I have been in daily communication with Secretary of State Hull, and agree with him that the unceasing efforts on the part of the members of the Conference who represent the twenty-one American Republics justify the highest hopes of us all.
The Conference is still in session, and this is not the time to analyze its specific accomplishments. But we have every reason for gratitude for the far-reaching and historic accomplishments already in sight at Buenos Aires.
The Conference should be an inspiration to all the peoples of the Americas and an example to the rest of the world. Good neighbors we are; good neighbors we shall remain.
