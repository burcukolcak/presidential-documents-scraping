Christmas Greetings to Disabled Veterans.
To you, who in time of national peril, have defended your country with courage, fortitude and heroic self-sacrifice, I extend my heartfelt holiday greetings. It is my earnest wish and that of an ever grateful nation that for you and those dear to you this Christmas season will be one of happiness and hope, and that the New Year will see your restoration to comfort and health in a happy nation long destined, in the Providence of God, to remain at peace.
