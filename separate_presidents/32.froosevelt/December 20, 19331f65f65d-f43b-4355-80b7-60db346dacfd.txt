The President's Reemployment Agreement Is Extended for Four Months.
THE President's Reemployment Agreement according to its original terms will end on December 31. At that time permanent Codes of Fair Competition will apply to approximately 70 percent of all employees who will eventually be covered by Codes.
In the midst of winter and with many persons out of work, it is essential that the new year should not bring with it any let down in the Recovery Program in the trades and industries which at that time have not come under approved Codes and to which, therefore, only the President's Reemployment Agreement applies.
I am, therefore, inviting every employer in those trades and industries to join with me in an extension of the President's Reemployment Agreement for four months. By that time it is expected that the process of Code making will have been virtually completed.
I urge all employers in trades and industries not covered by Codes to cooperate by continuing to maintain higher wages and shorter hours. The need for their help is still great.
Employers joining with me in this extension of the President's Reemployment Agreement may continue to display the Blue Eagle as a symbol of their cooperation and those few employers who have not heretofore signed the agreement may sign it as extended and upon delivering a signed certificate of compliance to the Post Office may obtain a Blue Eagle.
Display of the Blue Eagle on or after January 1, 1934, by an employer whose business is not entirely covered by an approved Code will be treated as an acceptance of the extension of the President's Reemployment Agreement and a representation that he is complying with it for that part of his business not covered by approved Codes.
