Letter on the Dominican Republic's Acceptance of Haiti's Mediation Proposals.
His Excellency

General Rafael Leonidas Trujillo President of the Dominican Republic Ciudad Trujillo, Dominican Republic
Great and Good Friend:
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's telegram advising me that inasmuch as the Haitian Government has had recourse to the peace procedure provided for in the Gondra Treaty of 1923 and in the Conciliation Convention of 1919 for the purpose of finding a peaceful solution of the controversy which unfortunately exists between Your Excellency's Government and the Government of Haiti, the Government of the Dominican Republic will take part in the procedure invoked by the Government of Haiti.
Permit me further to express my gratification by reason of Your Excellency's statement that the Government of the Dominican Republic will not give the slightest ground for a disturbance of the peace of America, in the preservation of which all the peoples of the New World have so great and legitimate an interest.
I extend to Your Excellency my most sincere wishes that the controversy which regrettably exists between two sister republics may obtain a rapid, just, and pacific solution through the utilization of the inter-American peace instruments to which they have now announced their determination to have recourse.
I am your sincere friend.
