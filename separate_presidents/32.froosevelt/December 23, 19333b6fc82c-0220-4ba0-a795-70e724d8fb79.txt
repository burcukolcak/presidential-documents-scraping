Statement on the Christmas Amnesty Proclamation
DURING the World War, a large number of persons were convicted under the Espionage Act and the Selective Service Act of giving utterance to sentiments adverse to the prosecution of the War and to the enforcement of the draft. They have paid the penalty that the law imposed on them. The emergency that made it necessary to punish them has long expired. Fifteen years have elapsed since the end of the War.
Accordingly I have issued a Christmas Amnesty Proclamation, extending a full pardon to all persons who were convicted of such war-time offenses, and who have complied with the sentences imposed on them. The effect of this proclamation is to restore to such persons their full civil rights.
The benefit of the Proclamation extends to all persons who were convicted of violations of Section 3 of Title I of the Espionage Act or of a conspiracy to violate the same; or of a conspiracy to violate Section 5 of the Selective Service Act; provided that they carried out the terms of the sentences which the courts inflicted. The former statute relates to the publication of seditious literature and the making of seditious speeches; the latter provision covers conspiracy to obstruct or interfere with the enforcement of the draft.
The proclamation expressly provides that the pardon does not extend to any other offenses than those specifically enumerated, whether committed before or after such offenses.
