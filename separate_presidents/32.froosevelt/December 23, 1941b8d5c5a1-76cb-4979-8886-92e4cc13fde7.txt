Statement to the Management-Labor Conference on Uninterrupted Production.
Gentlemen of the Conference:
Moderator Davis and Senator Thomas have reported to me the results of your deliberations. They have given me each proposition which you have discussed. I am happy to accept your general points of agreement as follows:
1. There shall be no strikes or lockouts.
2. All disputes shall be settled by peaceful means.
3. The President shall set up a proper War Labor Board to handle these disputes.
I accept without reservation your covenants that there shall be no strikes or lockouts and all disputes shall be settled by peaceful means. I shall proceed at once to act on your third point.
Government must act in general. The three points agreed upon cover of necessity all disputes that may arise between labor and management.
The particular disputes must be left to the consideration of those who can study the particular differences and who are thereby prepared by knowledge to pass judgment in the particular case. I have full faith that no group in our national life will take undue advantage while we are faced by common enemies.
I congratulate youâ€”I thank you, and our people will join me in appreciation of your great contribution.
Your achievement is a response to a common desire of all men of good will that strikes and lockouts cease and that disputes be settled by peaceful means.
May I now wish you all a Merry Christmas.
