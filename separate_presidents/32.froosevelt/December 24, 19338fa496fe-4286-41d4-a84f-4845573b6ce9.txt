Typical Christmas Greetings to American Diplomatic Officers.
As the year draws to a holiday pause before its close, I take much pleasure in sending out to you and through you to your personal and official family, and to the Foreign Service staffs my heartiest good wishes. Your loyal and intelligent cooperation with us in Washington has made these recent months of our association a source of great satisfaction and encouragement to me in this important period of our country's development.
In offering my best greetings for Christmas and the New Year, I look forward in confident anticipation to continuing mutual cooperation during 1934.
