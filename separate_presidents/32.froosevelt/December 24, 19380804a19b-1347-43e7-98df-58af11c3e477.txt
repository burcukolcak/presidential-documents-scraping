Christmas Greetings to the Army and Navy.
It gives me great pleasure to send my most cordial and hearty Christmas greetings to the Army and the Navy. Events of the past twelve months have served to focus public attention on the national defense and to bring home to all of our people a greater appreciation of the protective missions of our land and sea forces. The nation is grateful to its democratic armed forces, volunteers to a man, for their whole-hearted devotion to duty. It is my sincere hope that this holiday season will bring happiness and good cheer to all who wear the uniform of our republic.
