Statement on Signing a Proclamation Suspending the Marketing Quota Provisions of the Sugar Act of 1937
I have issued a proclamation today terminating the suspension of marketing quotas on sugar, which suspension was made necessary on September 11, 1939, by the extraordinary purchases of sugar by consumers immediately after the outbreak of the war in Europe and the excessive speculative activity and advancing prices which accompanied such purchases. Since that time consumer hoarding of sugar has ceased and the price of raw sugar has declined to the price which was in effect before the war. It should be noted that under the law the quotas may again be suspended if such action becomes necessary to protect the consumers.
