Statement on Conferences with Prime Minister Churchill.
Much has been accomplished this week through the medium of the many conferences held, in the meetings of the supply and production officials, in the sessions held by members of the military and naval groups, and in the discussions with the chiefs of missions of all Nations at war with the common enemy. Included were conferences with the Russian and Chinese Ambassadors, the Canadian Prime Minister, and the Netherlands Minister.
As a result of all of these meetings, I know tonight that the position of the United States and of all Nations aligned with us has been strengthened immeasurably. We have advanced far along the road toward achievement of the ultimate objective-the crushing defeat of those forces that have attacked and made war upon us.
The conferences will continue for an indefinite period of time. It' is impossible to say just now when they will terminate.
It is my purpose, as soon as it is possible, to give insofar as safety will permit—without giving information of military value to the enemy—a more detailed accounting of all that has taken place in Washington this week and of all that will take place during the remainder of the meetings.
The present over-all objective is the marshaling of all resources military and economic, of the world-wide front opposing the Axis. Excellent progress along these lines is being made.
