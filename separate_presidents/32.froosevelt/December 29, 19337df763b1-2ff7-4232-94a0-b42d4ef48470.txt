A Telegram on the President's Opposition to the Return of the Saloon.
Hon. Rubey M. Hulen,

Chairman, Democratic State Committee, Columbia, Mo.
Referring to your telegram of December twenty-fifth, it is obviously neither proper nor within my power to interfere in any way with the formulation of State legislation for the control of the liquor traffic. In view of the Party pledges given the Nation before the election in 1932 I have great confidence that our part}, leaders not only in your State, but wherever this question of liquor control is coming up will respect pledges made to the Electorate and will provide legislation that will make impossible the return of the open saloon and all its attendant evils. May I call your attention to the following in the proclamation which I issued repealing the Eighteenth Amendment: "I ask especially that no State shall by law or otherwise authorize the return of the saloon either in its old form or in some modern guise."
