A Proclamation
Whereassection 318 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (ch. 497, 46 Stat. 590, 696) provides, in part:
"Whenever the President shall by proclamation declare an emergency to exist by reason of a state of war, or otherwise, he may authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to extend during the continuance of such emergency the time herein prescribed for the performance of any act * * * ";
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the aforesaid provisions, do hereby proclaim an emergency to exist.
And I do further proclaim that it is necessary and proper, because of the emergency, that all merchandise (except grain) imported during the calendar year 1931 and entered for warehousing under section 557 of the Tariff Act of 1930 be permitted to remain in warehouse for a further period; and I therefore hereby authorize the Secretary of the Treasury, until further notice, to extend the warehousing period for such merchandise for not more than one year from and after the expiration of the three-year period prescribed in sections 557 and 559 of the Tariff Act of 1930:Provided,however, that in each and every case the Secretary of the Treasury shall require that the principal on the warehouse-entry bond, in order to obtain the benefits under the extension granted, shall either furnish to the Collector of Customs for the district in which the merchandise is warehoused the agreement of the sureties on such bond to remain bound under the terms and provisions of the bond to the same extent as if no extension were granted, or furnish an additional bond with acceptable sureties to cover the period of extension.
And I do further proclaim that it is necessary and proper, because of the emergency, that as to all wool or hair of the camel imported or withdrawn from bonded warehouse during the calendar year 1931 conditionally free of duty, under bond, under paragraph 1101 of the Tariff Act of 1930 for use in the manufacture of press cloth, camel's hair belting, rugs, carpets, or other floor coverings, or in the manufacture of knit or felt boots or heavy fulled lumbermen's socks, there shall be permitted a further period during which proof that such wool or hair has been so used may be furnished; and I therefore hereby authorize the Secretary of the Treasury, until further notice, to extend the period during which proof of such use may be furnished for not more than one year from and after the expiration of the three-year period prescribed in said paragraph 1101:Provided,however, that in each and every case the Secretary of the Treasury shall require that the principal on the bond, in order to obtain the benefits under the extension granted, shall either furnish to the Collector of Customs for the district in which the bond was given, the agreement of the sureties on such bond to remain bound under the terms and provisions of the bond to the same extent as if no extension were granted, or furnish an additional bond with acceptable sureties to cover the period of extension.
And I do further proclaim that it is necessary and proper, because of the emergency, that as to articles manufactured or produced in the United States with the use of imported or substituted merchandise for drawback purposes a further period for exportation (or shipment to the Philippine Islands) of the completed articles be permitted in those cases in which the merchandise involved was imported during the calendar year 1931; and I therefore hereby authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to extend the period for exportation (or shipment to the Philippine Islands) of the completed articles in such cases for not more than one year from and after the expiration of the three-year period prescribed in section 313 (h) of the Tariff Act of 1930.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
