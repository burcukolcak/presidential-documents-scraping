Message to Congress Recommending Acceptance of Andrew W. Mellon's Gift of Art.
To the Congress:
I commend to the consideration of the Congress the matter of enacting appropriate legislation to effect the acceptance by the United States of the magnificent gift referred to in my recent exchange of letters with Mr. Andrew W. Mellon. The conditions under which the gift is tendered are set out in the correspondence, copies of which are transmitted herewith.
The works of art thus offered to the Government constitute one of the finest and most valuable collections in existence, containing only objects of the highest standard of quality.
It is with a keen sense of appreciation of the generous purpose of the donor and the satisfaction that comes with the knowledge that such a splendid collection will be placed at the seat of our Government for the benefit and enjoyment of our people during all the years to come, that I submit this matter to the Congress.
The Attorney General and the Trustees of the Smithsonian Institution have conferred with representatives of the donor and will be glad to discuss the necessary legislation with the appropriate committees.
