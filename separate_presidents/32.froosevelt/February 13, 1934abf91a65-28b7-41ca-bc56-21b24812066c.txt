Letter to the Chief of Chaplains of the War Department.
My dear Colonel Brasted:
The Great Teacher said: "I come that ye may have life and that ye may have it more abundantly." The object of all our striving should be to realize that "abundant life."
The supreme values are spiritual. The hope of the world is that character which, built upon the solid rock, withstands triumphantly all the storms of life.
To build this exemplary character is our great task. Without it the abundant life cannot be realized, and the best citizens and best soldiers of a country are those who have put on the armor of righteousness.
Chaplains of the military and naval services and clergymen everywhere who by word and life are advancing the cause of idealism and true religion are doing a commendable work, one that is absolutely essential to the life of the Nation.
Very sincerely yours,
Colonel Alva J. Brasted, Chief of Chaplains, U. S. A.,
War Department, Washington, D. C.
