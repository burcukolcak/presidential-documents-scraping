Letter on Treasury Secretary Woodin's Resignation.
The following correspondence was made public today at the White House:
Tucson, Arizona,

December 13, 1933
Dear Governor:
It is with great regret that I am compelled to tender you my resignation as Secretary of the Treasury, to take effect at your convenience any time before January first.
The state of my health will not permit me to remain in this position.
I cannot express what a wrench it is to me to leave your official family and you must know how proud and happy I have been to have served you.
With great admiration and affection.
Faithfully yours,
W. H. WOODIN
The White House,

Washington, D.C., December 20, 1933

Dear Will:
That you feel you must definitely leave the Treasury post by the end of the year is, of course, a great sorrow to me; but I am even more saddened by the thought that the throat is still giving trouble. I know, however, that it is of the highest importance that you shelve all official cares, and that with your fine courage and constitution you will soon get wholly well. Remember that when that day comes you are wanted and needed in the service of the country. Your calm, practical and courageous action in the difficult days of last spring and summer will always be remembered.
All of us miss you greatly and all of us send you our devoted regards.
Henry Morgenthau, Jr., will go in on January 1, and I am happy in the thought that you so strongly approve the choice.
Take care of yourself.
Faithfully and affectionately yours,
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
Hon. William H. Woodin,
Tucson, Arizona.
