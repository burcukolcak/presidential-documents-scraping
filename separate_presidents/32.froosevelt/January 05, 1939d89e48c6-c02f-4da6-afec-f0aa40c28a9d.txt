Letter on the Sixth Observance of Brotherhood Day.
Dear Dr. Clinchy:
The sixth observance of Brotherhood Day under the auspices of the National Conference of Christians and Jews during the week of Washington's Birthday, 1939, gives emphasis to principles that are fundamental in the American way of life.
Never has it been more essential that our people of every national origin, race or faith should proclaim those civic ideals that they hold in common and engage together in those activities that reflect their common social aims.
Here in the United States, while maintaining the right to differ in our creeds, all groups must unite in maintaining for all, the liberties guaranteed by the American Constitution and in cultivating that mutual respect, friendship and cooperation across dividing lines, which will bind us together as a nation.
It is my hope that the observance of Brotherhood Day this year will advance these ideals.
Very sincerely yours,
Dr. Everett R. Clinchy,

National Conference of Christians and Jews,

New York, N.Y.
