Transmittal to Congress of a Report on Natural Resource Development.
To the Congress:
Plans and programs to win the war and to win the peace must grow out of our common national purpose and with democratic participation in planning by all of us. Through efforts to state our objectives and public discussion of their merits, we play our parts as free citizens. In that spirit, I am transmitting herewith for the information of the Congress the "Development of National Resourcesâ€”Report for 1942," prepared by the National Resources Planning Board, continuing the series begun last year and establishing the custom of an annual planning report as a companion document to the Budget of the United States.
The National Resources Planning Board, as the planning arm of my Executive Office, is charged with the preparation of long-range plans for the development of our national resources and the stabilization of employment. At my direction, it is correlating plans and programs under consideration in many Federal, State, and private organizations for postwar full employment, security, and building America. In this report the Board outlines some of our major objectives in planning to win the peace.
To facilitate its use by the Congress, I recommend that this report on these plans and programs be printed, together with supporting illustrations and tables, in conformity with similar reports by the Board.
