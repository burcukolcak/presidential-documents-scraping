Excerpts from the Press Conference
Q. Mr. President, quite a few of us have been writing stories about the activities of National Committeemen practicing before the Departments, and some have gone so far as to say that it is embarrassing the Administration. Have you anything to say on that?
THE PRESIDENT: I think if we can avoid reference to individuals, it is all right to talk about the general principle. I have felt all along that it is not quite in accord with the spirit of the Administration that any individual who holds a high Party position, such as National Committeeman, should earn a livelihood by practicing law, because, in a sense, he holds himself out as having access to the back door of the Administration. It just "is not done." . . .
