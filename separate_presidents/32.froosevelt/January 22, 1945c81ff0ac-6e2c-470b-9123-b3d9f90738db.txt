Statement on Food Conservation.
During the past three years every American who has played a part in the job of growing, conserving, harvesting, distributing, and processing our food supply has done a magnificent job.
As we enter a new year, the demands for our food at home and abroad are so great that it is essential for every man and woman to do everything to help in the huge task of getting the food produced and seeing that it is conserved and shared. Many of our favorite foods are scarce.
To this end, I ask the people in cities, towns, and villages to assist our farmers in every possible way to reach the food goals which have been set for this year.
I call upon the millions of victory gardeners who have done so much to swell the Nation's food supply in these war years to continue their good work.
I ask those people who can spare the time to assist the Nation's food processors in the task of preparing the food for our armed services, our civilians, and our allies.
I ask the millions of women who have preserved food at home so that our armed services could have the fruits and vegetables they need, to carry on until the war is won.
I ask every American to share our available food by observing the rules of rationing and by cooperating with food merchants in the observance of food price ceilings.
I know I can count on the American people to respond to these calls to action, so that we can all truly continue to say when the war is won that our food has played an important role in the fight for freedom.
