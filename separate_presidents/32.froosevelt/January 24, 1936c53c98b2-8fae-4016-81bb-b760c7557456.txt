Excerpt from a Press Conference Release on Land Use
So to manage physical use of land in the United States that we will not only maintain soil fertility, but will hand on to the next generation a country with better productive power and a greater permanency of land use than the one we inherited from the previous generationâ€”that is the broad objective.
We have got to go a long way to catch up with the mistakes of the past, so as to make the United States, as a whole, as productive as it was a hundred years ago.
