Radio Message on the Seventieth Anniversary of the Canadian Confederation.
On behalf Of the Government and people of the United States it gives me sincere gratification to extend a word of greeting to our Canadian friends and to congratulate them on the seventieth anniversary of Canadian Confederation.
Through the years that have elapsed since that memorable July 1st, 1867, we of the United States have watched with the keenest and most sympathetic interest the splendid progress of the Canadian nation which, in ever increasing measure, commands our respect and inspires our affection. Individually and collectively, we pledge you the continuation of our warm friendship. I do not know of any greater gift in the power of nations or of individuals to bestow.
On this occasion the Canadian people will pause to contemplate the changes, spiritual and cultural as well as material, of the past seventy years. The field is broad, but in whatever direction you may look you will find just cause for pride. We rejoice with you in your past and your present and in the promise which the future holds.
Ours is an enviable record of friendship and amity, as witness an unfortified boundary of more than five thousand miles as the outward and visible token of mutual confidence and good will. This friendship between our two peoples is secure from every hazard of destruction or misunderstanding because it is based upon a common aspiration to maintain, to defend, and to perpetuate the democratic form of constitutional, representative government. In that spirit I salute our neighbor of the north. I congratulate the Canadian people on the successful achievements of free institutions through three score and ten years of Confederation. And as one who has spent so many happy moments on Canadian soil, I send you my affectionate greetings.
