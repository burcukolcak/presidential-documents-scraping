Message to Congress on a Steeply Graduated Excess Profits Tax.
To the Congress:
We are engaged in a great national effort to build up our national defenses to meet any and every potential attack.
We are asking even our humblest citizens to contribute their mite.
It is our duty to see that the burden is equitably distributed according to ability to pay so that a few do not gain from the sacrifices of the many.
I, therefore, recommend to the Congress the enactment of a steeply graduated excess profits tax, to be applied to all individuals and all corporate organizations without discrimination.
