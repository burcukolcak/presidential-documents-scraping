Statement on the Prevention of Forest Fires.
More than thirty years ago we, as a Nation, began a great battle to save our forest resources.
This battle we are renewing, I am proud to say, over a wide front. Twelve million acres of land unsuited to agriculture have been acquired by the Government since 1933, and will be given a chance to become again a rich domain of useful trees, clear streams, and abundant wildlife. More than a billion seedlings have been set out in areas so completely ruined by cutting and burning that Nature's methods of reforesting had little chance against man's methods of destruction.
Foresters and the men of the CCC are doing their part in the battle to protect and increase our forest wealth, but they are waging a stubborn war against fire. Behind this simple statement there is a tragic story. Nine times out of ten the thing that starts a forest fire is man's carelessness or his indifference. It is hard to believe, but twenty-five percent of all our forest fires are incendiary in origin. Another twenty-five percent are caused by smokers. We are destroying our forest wealth through fire alone at the rate of $51,000,000 a year.
'This frightful waste of a vital natural resource can be greatly reduced through the whole-hearted cooperation of our citizens in being careful with fire in the woods and in reporting small fires promptly. I urge you to do your part in helping us keep fire away from our forests.
