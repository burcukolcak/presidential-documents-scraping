Remarks at Cape Haitien, Haiti.
I am very happy to come back to Cape Haitien. I shall always remember as long as I live the week which I had the privilege of spending in the Republic of Haiti.
I am glad to come back especially at a time when the relationship between the Republic of Haiti and the Republic of the United States will be restored to a basis of complete independence.
I am glad that, as a result of the visit of President Vincent to Washington, as he has so well said, two out of three points which we considered have already been consummated or are about to be consummated.
Very soon, I think within a month or six weeks, the last Americans who have served here with the Garde d'Haiti and with the Marines will leave the Republic of Haiti. That is not all. I am very hopeful and very certain that when these Americans leave your shores you will think of them with the spirit of friendship and that you will be happy in the days to come remembering that they tried to help the people of Haiti, and so when they go, Mr. President, I am certain also that you will carry on the same spirit of friendship between our peoples which must always exist in the future. We shall have the same confidence, closer relationships of commerce and also something that you desire far more than commerce, and that is a spirit of understanding and a spirit of friendship between not only our two peoples but also our two Governments.
And so, Mr. President, I am happy to come here once more. ! wish that I had the opportunity again to go from one end of the Republic to the other. In this short visit, I want to thank you for your hospitality; and I want to thank you for the great pains to which you have gone to make my visit most comfortable, and I want to drink to the health of the President of Haiti, to the Government of Haiti, and to the people of Haiti. May our friendship ever continue!
