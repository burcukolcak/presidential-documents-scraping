Remarks in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands.
I just wanted to say a word while we are here in the family that I am very proud of the work that has been done down in the Virgin Islands because it shows what can be done with a little help from Washington and a great deal of cooperation down here toward improving the conditions of a great many thousands of human beings. Of course, we never expect the Virgin Islands to be a tremendous factor in trade but we do hope that they may be self-sustaining.
The experiment that we are working out in the Virgin Islands is being watched by Washington with a great deal of interest. We have a unit in the Virgin Islands where we can actually see the results of their work. I am very proud of what you have done. I hope to come here again before I leave Washington and see some more of these fine results. I am glad to see you all.
