Letter to Leon McCord on Repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment.
Dear Mr. McCord,
I have received your telegram of July 3rd in reference to the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment.
I think I have made it abundantly clear that the platform of the Democratic Party adopted last year should be carried out in so far as it lies in our power. The Special Session of the Congress has already translated into law a great majority of the pledges made.
One of the pledges of the platform reads as follows: "We advocate the repeal of the 18th Amendment. To effect such repeal we demand that the Congress immediately propose a Constitutional Amendment to truly representative conventions in the States called to act solely on that proposal."
The Congress has acted on this and many of the States are now engaged in holding elections for the conventions proposed.
Finally, I have made it clear ever since my nomination a year ago that I subscribe to the Democratic platform one hundred percent.
In view of the fact that I have had so great a number of telegrams similar to yours not only from your State, but from Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky and others, I am taking the liberty of giving this message to you to the press.
Sincerely,

Hon. Leon McCord

National Democratic Committeeman,

Montgomery, Ala.
