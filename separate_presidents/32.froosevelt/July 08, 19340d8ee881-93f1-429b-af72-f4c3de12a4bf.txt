Remarks in St. Croix, Virgin Islands.
My friends in St. Croixâ€”I am very glad to come here and I am very grateful to you for this splendid reception and very hearty welcome, and I want you to remember that today, more than ever before, the people of the continental United States remember and realize that you, also, are a part of the American family.
