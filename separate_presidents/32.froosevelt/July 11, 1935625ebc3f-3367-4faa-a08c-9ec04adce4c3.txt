Statement on Accepting a Portrait of King George V.
Mr. Ambassador:
I am happy to accept on behalf of the American people this admirable portrait of His Majesty King George V, which is presented by the artist, Mr. Frank Salisbury.
I have already expressed to Mr. Salisbury my appreciation of his gift but I should be grateful, Mr. Ambassador, if you would tell him of the particular pleasure with which I have actually today received the portrait.
I likewise should be grateful if you would inform His Majesty that the portrait will be hung in the national gallery where it will be seen by great numbers of our citizens who come to Washington from all parts of the United States. It will be a privilege for these citizens to observe the likeness of a monarch whose faithful and steadfast qualities of leadership have aroused so much admiration in this country. The portrait will be a symbol of the many ties which draw together the peoples of our respective Nations.
I thank you, Mr. Ambassador, for your courtesy in coming here personally this morning to present the portrait.
