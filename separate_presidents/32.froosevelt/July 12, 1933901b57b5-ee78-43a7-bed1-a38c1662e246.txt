Letter to the Postmaster General Regarding Executive Order 6203.
My dear Mr. Postmaster General:

I have signed and am returning herewith an Executive Order relating to the filling of postmasterships of the first, second and third classes.
The studies which you have made show that there would be large savings to the Government if the existing law were changed and all present postmasterships were placed on a strictly Civil Service basis as is the case under the existing law relating to fourth class post offices.
Will you, therefore, be good enough to prepare for me proposed legislation to this effect in order that I may submit it to the next session of Congress?

Very sincerely yours,

The Hon. James A. Farley

The Postmaster General

Washington, D.C.
