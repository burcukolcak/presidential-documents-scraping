A Tribute to Speaker Joseph W. Byrns on the Occasion of His Death.
Speaker Byrns belonged to that school of statesmen which is the hope and justification of our democracy. By a happy coincidence he represented for more than a quarter of a century the Hermitage District of Tennessee, a district of sentimental significance because it holds the sacred dust of Andrew Jackson; and there was about Speaker Byrns a simplicity and rugged honesty which we have come to associate with the name of Jackson. Fearless, incorruptible, unselfish, with a high sense of justice, wise in counsel, broad of vision, calm in adversity and modest in victory, he served his State and the Nation with fidelity, honor and great usefulness.
I personally mourn the passing of a steadfast friend of many years.
