Letter on Railroad Retirement Legislation.
My dear Mr. Chairman:
In conformity with my telephone conversation with you, I am enclosing herewith a letter to me from the Attorney General under date of June 4th. This letter follows conferences between the Attorney General, the Coordinator of Transportation and Mr. Donald Richberg. The Attorney General suggests that in view of the sweeping character of the Supreme Court decision in the Railroad Retirement case, it would be unwise to attempt to secure new legislation at this session of the Congress. He further suggests the passage of a Resolution by the Congress to create a commission to investigate the factual situation and make findings and suggestions for further legislation, if any.
Very sincerely yours,
Hon. Sam Rayburn,

Chairman, Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee House of Representatives,

Washington, D. C.
