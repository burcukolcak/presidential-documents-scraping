Letter Affirming Federal Relief Program Policy.
My dear Mr. Mayor:
In reply to your telegram regarding federal relief program, there is no intention of shifting from present policy of providing relief for able-bodied unemployed through a work program. The states and municipalities must continue to provide for direct relief as their fair share of the total program and cannot expect assistance from the federal government in meeting this responsibility.
Any confusion regarding the respective responsibilities of federal, state and local governments which results in a weakening of the efforts of states and municipalities in the field of direct relief or of the federal work program will prove disastrous and should at all costs be avoided. I will appreciate very much your cooperation in making this clear to mayors.
Very sincerely yours,
Honorable F. H. LaGuardia,

United States Conference of Mayors,

New York, N.Y.
