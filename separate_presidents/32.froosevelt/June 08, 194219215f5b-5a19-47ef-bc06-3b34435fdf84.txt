Letter Accepting the Annual Award of The Churchman.
My dear Mr. Shipler:
You and your distinguished associates have given me The Churchman Award for the promotion of good will and understanding among all peoples. I wish I could be with you tonight to accept the award in person and to tell you how deeply I appreciate the honor. It symbolizes a cause that has long been close to my heart and mind: never more so than in this fateful year of destiny for all peoples.
The spiritual liberties of mankind are in jeopardy. Their religious freedom is at stake. The road ahead is dark and perilous. Yet we and our associates in the great alliance of the United Nations are determined to establish a new age of freedom on this earth. We are dedicating all that we have and are to that end. We are fighting in that cause at the side of valiant forces, representing every race and every creed. And with the united help of all free men and of all the great institutions of freedom, of which the churches of the free stand first, we shall create a new world in which there is freedom of worship and utterance, freedom from want and from fear, for all peoples everywhere in the world.
