The President's Commentary on the Four Power Pact.
The initialing at Rome of the Four Power Pact between France, Germany, Great Britain and Italy is a good augury. The United States welcomes every effort toward replacing conflicting national aims by international cooperation for the greater advantage of all. This agreement of the principal European Powers to work closely together for the preservation of peace should give renewed courage to all who are striving for the success of the Geneva and London Conferences.
