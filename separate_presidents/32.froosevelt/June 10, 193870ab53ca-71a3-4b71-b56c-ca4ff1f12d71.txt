Letter on the National Labor Relations Act.
My dear Hatton:
There has just come to my attention the minority report of the Committee on Judiciary relative to H.R. 6449 "Amending the Walsh-Healy Act."
I note this minority report states: "The President of the United States has recognized the disastrous effects of industrial strife now prevalent in the country and the unsatisfactory operation of the National Labor Relations Act, and has announced that a special commission will be appointed by him to study the entire problem, looking to recommendations for labor legislation in the Seventy-sixth Congress."
I wish to call to your attention the fact that I have no intention of appointing any commission to study the operation of the National Labor Relations Act. I assume that the signers of the minority report have reference to the proposed study of industrial relations in Great Britain. As I publicly stated on June 3, I am solely interested in securing a report on the status of industrial relations in Great Britain with particular emphasis on the functioning of collective agreements, in order that certain current misconceptions may be clarified.
I am taking the liberty of bringing these facts to your attention so that the House of Representatives may be correctly informed of the purpose of the proposed survey of British industrial relations.
Very sincerely yours,
Honorable Hatton W. Sumners,

House of Representatives,

Washington, D. C.
