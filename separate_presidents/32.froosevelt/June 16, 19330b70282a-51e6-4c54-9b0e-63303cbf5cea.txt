Letter of Appreciation to the House of Representatives.
Dear Mr. Speaker:
Before the adjournment of the Special Session I want to convey to you and to the members of the House of Representatives an expression of my thanks for making possible, on the broad average, a more sincere and whole-hearted cooperation between the legislative and the executive branches of the United States Government than has been witnessed by the American people in many a long year.
This spirit of teamwork has in most cases transcended party lines. It has taken cognizance of a crisis in the affairs of our Nation and of the world. It has grasped the need for a new approach to problems both new and old. It has proven that our form of government can rise to an emergency and can carry through a broad program in record time.
I am certain that the American people are appreciative of the work of this Special Session of the Seventy-third Congress.
Please let me add that the past few months have given to me very special pleasure in the renewal of old friendships and the forming of new friendships among the House of Representatives. To each and every one of you I send my best wishes for a well-deserved and happy holiday during the coming months.
Hon. Henry T. Rainey
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.
