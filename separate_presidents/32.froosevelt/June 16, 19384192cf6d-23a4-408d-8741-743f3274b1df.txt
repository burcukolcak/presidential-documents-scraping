Greeting on the Close of the Congressional Session.
My dear Mr. Speaker:
In these closing hours of the 1938 Session of the 75th Congress I want to extend through you to the members of the House of Representatives of the United States my sincere good wishes.
I am confident that the country joins with me in the belief that this session of the Congress has resulted in much constructive legislation for the benefit of the people. Definitely, we are making progress in meeting the many new problems which confront us.
With appreciation of all that you have done,
Faithfully yours,
Hon. William B. Bankhead,

Speaker of the House of Representatives,

Washington, D. C.
