Request to the N.R.A. for Information on Labor Standards and Trade Practice.
My dear Mr. O'Neill:
In line with our recent discussion, I am requesting you to set up in the Division of Business Cooperation a section devoted to accumulating, checking and reporting accurate information concerning the extent to which changes occur in the maintenance of labor standards or fair practice provisions of codes of fair competition, following the abolition of such codes.
It is of primary importance that this work should be done very carefully and under the supervision of an impartial committee, which might be constituted as follows: An impartial chairman, a representative of management and a representative of labor, and a member designated by the Department of Commerce and another by the Department of Labor. Through such a committee this work may be coordinated with the informational services of the Departments of Commerce and Labor, and with similar services maintained by organizations of employers or employees.
Information should be collected through field offices and other available sources under such supervision that reports sent to Washington can be checked, compiled and put in form for appropriate publication with assurance that they are accurate and as comprehensive as possible. It should be emphasized that the purposes of this work are to gather and publish reliable information and to counteract any propaganda from private sources which may be designed to promote a special interest.
Very sincerely yours,
Honorable James L. O'Neill,

Acting Administrator,

National Recovery Administration,

Washington, D. C.
