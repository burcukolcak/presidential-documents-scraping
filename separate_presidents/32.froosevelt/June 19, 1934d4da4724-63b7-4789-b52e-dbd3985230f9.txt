Statement on a Labor Dispute in the Steel Industry.
I have discussed with the Secretary of Labor every detail of the proposal that has been made by a committee of the Amalgamated Steel, Iron and Tin Workers on behalf of employees in the steel industry. The Secretary has described to me also the proposal that the employers in the Steel Industry made last week to the Administrator for N.R.A.
It is my hope that some method will be found to adjust all the points that are in controversy and to preserve orderly relations without sacrificing any principle that is involved.
I have referred the proposal to the Secretary of Labor for careful study and to undertake any negotiations that seem advisable. The Secretary is fully empowered to represent me in taking whatever action seems advisable under the circumstances and will, of course, consult and cooperate with all other agencies of Government concerned.
