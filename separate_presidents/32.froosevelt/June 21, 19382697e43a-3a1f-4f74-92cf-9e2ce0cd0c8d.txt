A Letter to the Committee to Study Industrial Relations in Great Britain.
My dear Miss Dickerman:
It is with great pleasure that I have learned that you have accepted the invitation of the Secretary of Labor to cooperate in the preparation of a report on industrial relations in Great Britain.
In view of the many comments that have come to my attention relative to industrial relations in Great Britain, I feel that there is a definite need for an impartial report which will adequately portray the real situation that prevails in British industry. I trust that, through conferring with British Government officials, industrial leaders, and labor officials, you will be in a position to report to the Secretary of Labor not only on the exact status of labor-employer relations in England, but also on the evolution of the established and accepted procedures that account for the current state of industrial relations in that country.
Very cordially yours,
Miss Marion Dickerman,

Hyde Park, N. Y.
