By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Whereasunder and by virtue of section 336 of Title III, Part II, of the act of Congress approved June 17, 1930 (46 Stat. 590, 701), entitled "AN ACT To provide revenue, to regulate commerce with foreign countries, to encourage the industries of the United States, to protect American labor, and for other purposes," the United States Tariff Commission has investigated the differences in costs of production of, and all other facts and conditions enumerated in said section with respect to, velveteens and velvets, including velveteen or velvet ribbons, cut or uncut, whether or not the pile covers the entire surface, wholly or in chief value of cotton, being wholly or in part the growth or product of the United States and of and with respect to like or similar articles wholly or in part the growth or product of the principal competing countries;
Whereasin the course of said investigation a hearing was held, of which reasonable public notice was given and at which parties interested were given reasonable opportunity to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard;
Whereasthe commission has reported to the President the results of said investigation and its findings with respect to such differences in costs of production;
Whereasthe commission has found it shown by said investigation that the principal competing country for velveteens, wholly or in chief value of cotton, is Germany, and that the duties expressly fixed by statute do not equalize the differences in the costs of production of the domestic articles and the like or similar foreign articles when produced in said principal competing country, and has specified in its report the decreases in the rate of duty expressly fixed by statute found by the commission to be shown by said investigation to be necessary to equalize such differences; and
Whereasin the judgment of the President the decreased rates of duty on velveteens, wholly or in chief value of cotton, specified in said report are shown by such investigation of the Tariff Commission to be necessary to equalize such differences in costs of production;
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,President of the United States of America, do hereby approve and proclaim the following rates of duty found to be shown by said investigation to be necessary to equalize such differences in costs of production:
A decrease (within the limit of total decrease provided for in said act) in the rate of duty expressly fixed in paragraph 909 of Title I of said act on plain-back velveteens, cut or uncut, whether or not the pile covers the entire surface, wholly or in chief value of cotton, from 62-% per centum ad valorem to 31-% per centum ad valorem; and
A decrease in the rate of duty expressly fixed in paragraph 909 of Title I of said act on twill-back velveteens, cut or uncut, whether or not the pile covers the entire surface, wholly or in chief value of cotton, from 62-%2 per centum ad valorem to 44 per centum ad valorem.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Doneat the city of Washington this 24 day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and fifty-seventh.
