By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 (54 Stat. 885), it is hereby determined and ordered that:
1. The national interest requires that between July 1, 1941, and June 30, 1942, 900,000 men be inducted into the land forces of the United States under the said Act.
2. At such time or times between July 1, 1941, and June 30, 1942, as he deems expedient, the Secretary of War shall make or cause to be made timely requisition for not to exceed 900,000 men selected under the said Act and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, and shall induct such men into the land forces of the United States.
3. In the manner provided by the said Act and regulations, the Director of Selective Service shall direct and supervise the selection of such numbers of men as in his judgment are likely to be required from time to time to meet the requisitions made pursuant to paragraph 2 hereof, and shall make or cause to be made available for induction into the land forces of the United States a sufficient number of selected men to fill such requisitions.
