Letter to the Senate Requesting Ratification of the Migratory Bird Treaty with Mexico.
To the Senate:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith a convention for the protection of migratory birds and game mammals, between the United States of America and the United Mexican States, signed at Mexico City, February 7, 1936, and an exchange of notes expressing an understanding between the Governments of the two countries that ratifications are to be exchanged in Washington and the convention will come into force on the day on which ratifications are exchanged.
The convention is similar to the treaty for the protection of migratory birds in the United States and Canada signed August 16, 1916. That convention was unquestionably a great step forward toward the restoration and protection of our migratory birds. But inasmuch as numbers of species of the birds whose protection in the United States and Canada has long been provided for, extend their migrations to Mexico and still farther south, and in order to protect other groups of girds which migrate between the United States and the United Mexican States, it is obvious that effective conservation requires further international cooperation. It is for these purposes that the convention with Mexico has been concluded.
The attention of the Senate is invited to the accompanying report from the Secretary of State and the comment of the Secretary of Agriculture presented therein.
