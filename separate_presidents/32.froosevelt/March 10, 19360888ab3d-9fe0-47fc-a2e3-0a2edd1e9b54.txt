Statement on the Proposed Farm Market Survey.
Chester C. Davis, as Administrator of the Agricultural Adjustment Act and related Acts, has been selected to make a special study for the United States Government of economic conditions in Europe which have a direct bearing upon agricultural programs already undertaken or being planned in this country.
In requesting him to make this study for our Government, Secretary Wallace and I have had in mind the distinguished service Mr. Davis has given American Agriculture, especially during the past two and one-half years. As Administrator, he has been directing governmental efforts which, to a considerable degree, were made necessary by changes in the European outlets for American farm products.
Information to be gathered by him at close hand into the precise nature and extent of these economic changes abroad is expected to assist greatly in developing American farm programs.
Mr. Davis plans to sail for Europe about March 20th. During the absence of Mr. Davis, H. R. Tolley, nationally known agricultural economist, director of the Giannini Foundation and formerly Assistant Administrator, will be Acting Administrator of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and as such will be in direct charge of the present work of developing the programs under the new Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act.
