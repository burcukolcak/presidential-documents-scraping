Statement on the Proposed Constitution of the Philippine Islands.
I am happy to state that the Constitution submitted to me on behalf of the Philippine Constitutional Convention for certification under the Tydings-McDuffie Independence Act conforms with the provisions of the Act.
The members of the Convention are congratulated on the satisfactory completion of a task so important and significant in the life of their people.
In the event of ratification of this Constitution, the authority granted to the Commonwealth Government will permit exercise by the Filipino people of general control of their local affairs, subject only to a few important exceptions.
During the period of the Commonwealth, there will remain with the Government of the United States authority commensurate with and necessary for or appropriate to the ultimate responsibilities of sovereignty.
Animated solely by feelings of cordiality, sympathy and loyalty, the people of the United States and the people of the Philippine Islands have been conducting together a great experiment, and during the period of the Commonwealth Government this experiment will continue until the ultimate withdrawal of United States sovereignty and the establishment of complete independence.
