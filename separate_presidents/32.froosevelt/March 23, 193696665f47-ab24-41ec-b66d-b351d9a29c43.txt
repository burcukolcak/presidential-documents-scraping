Letters on Continuing the C.C.C.
My dear Mr. Fechner:
In reviewing the Emergency Conservation Work program for the period ending March 31, 1937, at which date the emergency conservation work will terminate according to existing law, I have determined that the present number of Civilian Conservation Corps camps shall be maintained unless such camps are reduced as a result of the completion of the work now being performed by the enrollees of any such camps, or the reduction through discharges, separations, or other causes in the number of enrollees to approximately 163 in any one camp.
I have also determined that the total number of enrollees for the Civilian Conservation Corps should be gradually reduced to about 350,000 and this number maintained through March 31,1937.
It is appreciated that no hard and fast rule can be laid down. You are therefore authorized to take such measures as may be necessary to carry out this general program as nearly as may be practicable.
Additional funds not to exceed $6,825,000 will be allotted to you as and when needed from the appropriation contained in the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 for the balance of this fiscal year, and steps will be taken to secure the necessary funds for the fiscal year 1937.
Very truly yours,
Honorable Robert Fechner,

Director of Emergency Conservation Work,

Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. Buchanan:
I am enclosing a copy of a letter which I have today written to Mr. Fechner requesting him to maintain the Civilian Conservation Corps at about 350,000 enrollees up to the time the emergency conservation work ceases on March 31, 1937.
This will probably involve an increase in the estimate of $246,000,000 contained in the budget for the Civilian Conservation Corps for the period July 1, 1936 to March 31, 1937, on the basis of 300,000 men, of whatever amount is determined to be necessary to care for the increase of the number of enrollees by 50,000. An estimate to cover this amount will be submitted in due course through the usual channels.
Very truly yours,
Honorable James P. Buchanan,

Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,

House of Representatives.
