Transmittal to Congress of the Anglo-American Base Transfer Agreement.
To the Congress:
On September 3, 1940, I transmitted for the information of the Congress notes exchanged between the British Ambassador at Washington and the Secretary of State on the preceding day, under which this Government acquired the right to lease naval and air bases in Newfoundland and in the islands of Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jamaica, St. Lucia, Trinidad, and Antigua, and in British Guiana. I now transmit for the information of the Congress a copy of an agreement for the use and operation of these bases, which was signed in London on March 27, 1941, together with the notes exchanged in connection therewith. These bases are for American defense against attack and their construction is consistent with such defense. International developments since my message to the Congress of September third last have emphasized the value to the Western Hemisphere of these outposts of security.
