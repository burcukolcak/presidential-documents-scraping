Letter to General Delafield.
My dear General Delafield:
The celebration of Army Day at this time is fortunate in that it presents a fitting occasion for the Nation to take stock and consider the ideals which led us to stand shoulder to shoulder, facing the dangers of war.
Present emergencies are being met with this same spirit of unity. The problems are great but will be overcome, Together we cannot fail.
I wish to add my endorsement to the celebration of Army Day and especially to commend the citizen components of the Military Service for their patriotism and continued service to their country.
Very sincerely yours, Brig.

Gen. John R. Delafield,

Commander-in-Chief,

Military Order of the World War,

Washington, D. C.
