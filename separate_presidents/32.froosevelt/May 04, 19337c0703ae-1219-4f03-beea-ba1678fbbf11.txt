Message to Congress on Emergency Railroad Legislation.
To the Congress:
The steam railways still constitute the main arteries of commerce in the United States. At this time, however, available traffic is not sufficient profitably to utilize existing railway facilities and the supplementary facilities provided by new forms of transportation.
Our broad problem is so to coordinate all agencies of transportation as to maintain adequate service. I am not yet ready to submit to the Congress a comprehensive plan for permanent legislation.
I do believe, however, that three emergency steps can and should be taken at this Special Session of the Congress.
First, I recommend the repeal of the recapture provisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission Act. The Commission has pointed out that existing provisions are unworkable and impracticable.
Second, railway holding companies should be placed definitely under the regulation and control of the Interstate Commerce Commission in like manner as the railways themselves.
Third, as a temporary emergency measure, I suggest the creation of a Federal Coordinator of Transportation who, working with groups of railroads, will be able to encourage, promote or require action on the part of carriers, in order to avoid duplication of service, prevent waste, and encourage financial reorganizations. Such a Coordinator should also, in carrying out this policy, render useful service in maintaining railroad employment at a fair wage.
The experience gained during the balance of this year will greatly assist the Government and the carriers in preparation for a more permanent and a more comprehensive national transportation policy at the regular session of the Congress in 1934.
