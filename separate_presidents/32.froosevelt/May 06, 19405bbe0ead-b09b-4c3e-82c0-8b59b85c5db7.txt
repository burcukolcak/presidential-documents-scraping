Greeting to New Citizens.
My dear Madam Secretary:
It gives me real pleasure to join in the observance of "I Am An American Day," which has been set aside as a public occasion for the recognition of all who, by coming of age, or naturalization, are attaining the status of citizenship.
Great responsibility rests upon those born here, who are reaching their majority and also upon those born in other lands who, as new citizens, are taking the oath of allegiance to the United States. Now, they must be prepared to share with millions of their fellow citizens in the responsibilities and duties which are those of all patriotic and home-loving Americans.
It will be their responsibility and their duty always to think first of America and at the same time to think in terms of humanity. This nation was created to insure the things that unite and to eliminate the things that divide. It will continue to be a land of opportunity for native-born and foreign-born citizens. It will continue to offer them the hope, liberty and justice which have always prevailed in this great democracy of ours.
I join with citizens everywhere in welcoming the more than two million American-born boys and girls reaching the age of twenty-one this year, and also additional thousands of foreign born becoming citizens by adoption. In return for the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, I am sure they will, for all the years of their lives, perform the high patriotic and American duty of supporting their Government at all times in keeping with its principles, traditions and ideals as a democracy.
Very sincerely yours,
The Honorable,?

Frances Perkins,

Secretary of Labor,

Washington, D.C.
