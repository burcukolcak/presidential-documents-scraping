Statement on Mother's Day.
On the ninth day of May, 1914, President Wilson, in response to a Joint Resolution of the Congress, issued a proclamation directing Government officials to display the United States flag on all Government buildings and inviting the people of the United States to display the flag at their homes or other suitable places on each second Sunday in May as a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country.
In the intervening years the observance of Mother's Day has assumed a deep and growing significance. It is not my purpose this year to issue a special proclamation on the subject as I believe that the attention of the American people will be so devoted to the cause of that day that repeated formal action on the part of the Chief Executive is unnecessary.
I prefer to think that the tributes which will be paid to mothers will come simply and spontaneously from our hearts.
