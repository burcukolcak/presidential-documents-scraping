Congratulations to General Eisenhower on the Victory in Tunisia.
General Dwight D. Eisenhower:
My warm personal congratulations to you on the great success of the recent operations in North Africa. The power and coordination with which the Allied forces are crushing our enemies in Tunisia is a tribute to your leadership. The unprecedented degree of Allied cooperation makes a pattern for the ultimate defeat of the Axis.
Convey to General Alexander my appreciation of the splendid manner in which he directed the ground armies of three Nations in a series of devastating blows against the enemy. My congratulations to Air Marshal Tedder on his overwhelming air victory; to Admiral Cunningham on the destruction of the Axis shipping by his naval craft; to General Montgomery on the culmination of his odyssey; and to General Anderson for his perfect team play.
