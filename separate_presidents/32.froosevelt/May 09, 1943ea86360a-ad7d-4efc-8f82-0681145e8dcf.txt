Congratulations to General Giraud on the Victory in Tunisia.
General Henri Honore Giraud:
I express the admiration of the people of America in saluting the brilliant contributions of the French forces under your command which culminated yesterday in the capture of Tunis and Bizerte. Soldiers of France have demonstrated that they waited only the opportunity to spring back at their Nazi oppressors. This precedent, so victoriously established, is the beginning of the day when the United Nations, working in concert, will restore France to its people.
