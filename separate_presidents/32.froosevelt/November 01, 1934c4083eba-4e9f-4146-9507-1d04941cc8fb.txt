Statement Appealing for Support of the American Red Cross.
Our people continue to look to the American Red Cross as the kindly and always helpful good neighbor to whom they turn for practical aid in emergency. They do so with the assurance that this national relief agency, with an organization in thirteen thousand American communities, has not and will not fail them.
In the difficult twelve months which have elapsed since last November Red Cross volunteers throughout the land have worked in close cooperation with the Federal, State and local governments in their humanitarian labors. Their service has not been limited to aid in furnishing the actual necessities of life, but has extended to the equally important field of safeguarding public health and of training their neighbors in the proper methods of caring for the sick or the injured.
At the same time the organization has continued to fulfill its obligation as our agency of relief for every community visited by disaster.
The Red Cross is looked upon as the representative of all of our people in times of distress. In order that it may continue its service to humanity it is highly important that we lend our support through individual membership.
I hope everyone who possibly can do so will respond generously to the Red Cross appeal.
