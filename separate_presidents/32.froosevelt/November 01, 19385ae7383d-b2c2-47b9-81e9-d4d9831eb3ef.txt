Honorable Charles Broughton,

Democratic National Committeeman,

Sheboygan, Wisconsin.
Your very interesting letter has come to my attention. As you know I have previously indicated my interest in the campaign of Senator Duffy. Ryan always has cooperated loyally. He is a real friend of liberal government. I sincerely hope that the great liberal State of Wisconsin will not diminish its strength in the Senate of the United States by entrusting to one who is neither liberal in heart nor in mind the vitally important duty of representing Wisconsin in the Senate.
