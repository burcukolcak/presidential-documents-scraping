Statement on Seizure of the Coal Mines.
For some time we have not been producing the coal which we need to fight the war. When we should be working to increase to the utmost the production of coal, production has stopped because of the failure of the miners to return to their work.
I have been obliged to direct the Secretary of the Interior to take immediate possession of the mines and to operate them for the Government.
Because I appreciate the desire of the miners to work under a contract, I have authorized the Secretary of the Interior to enter into collective bargaining contracts with representatives of the miners to govern the terms and conditions of employment during the period of Government operation. Such contracts will be made in accordance with the recent opinion of the National War Labor Board and will be subject to its approval in accordance with the provision of the War Labor Disputes Act.
As President of the United States and as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, I call upon every miner to return without a day's delay to the mines.
The grievances of the miners have been heard. They have been fairly dealt with. The Government offers the miners a fair contract. They have no right in wartime to refuse to work under it.
Coal must be mined. The enemy does not wait. The failure to mine coal at this critical moment is impeding the prosecution of the war and endangering the lives of our sons and brothers, the sons and brothers of the miners, on the battlefields.
The mines will be opened by the Government on Wednesday morning. Every miner will be expected to be at his post of duty, ready to work for his Government.
