Franklin D. Roosevelt
November 03, 1939

Greeting to Congress at the Close of the Extraordinary Session.
My dear Mr. Vice President:
As it seems probable that this extraordinary session of the Congress will be brought to adjournment within a few hours, may I extend through you to the Members of the Senate my congratulations and good wishes?
I hope that world events will not make it necessary to have any other extraordinary session—and, therefore, in anticipation of seeing you all on the third of January next, I extend to you in the meantime my best wishes for a Happy Thanksgiving and a Merry Christmas. May I add that I hope those Members from States whose Governors have set November thirtieth as Thanksgiving Day will celebrate both Thanksgivings—the twenty-third and the thirtieth.
Very sincerely yours,
The Honorable

The Vice President of the United States,

United States Senate,

Washington, D.C.
