Congratulations to the U.S.S.R. on Its Twenty-fifth Anniversary.
His Excellency Mikhail Kalinin, President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Moscow, U.S.S.R.:
On the occasion of this twenty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet State I convey to Your Excellency the congratulations of the Government and people of the United States.
For the second time in a generation our two countries are in the forefront of a gathering of Nations aligned against a common enemy. Collaboration in the mighty military task before us must be the prelude to collaboration in the mightier task of creating a world at peace.
The resistance of free peoples has made possible the mounting powers of the United Nations. The Russian Army and the Russian people in their continuing struggle against Nazi conquest today bear the brunt of the massed weight of the Nazi might and their incomparable heroism stands as a symbol of determination and unrelenting effort.
Let Your Excellency rest assured that the steadily growing power of the United States has been, and will continue to be, dedicated to complete victory.
