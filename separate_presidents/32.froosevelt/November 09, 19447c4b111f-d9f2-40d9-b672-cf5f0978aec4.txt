Letter to Herbert H. Lehman on the First Anniversary of U.N.R.R.A.
On the first anniversary of the creation of U.N.R.R.A., I wish to send to you and to the members of your staff my warmest congratulations on the great progress which you have made during this last year in preparing for the tremendous tasks ahead and my renewed good wishes for the successful fulfillment of your noble undertaking.
I and the other responsible officials of this Government have watched with keenest interest the development of U.N.R.R.A. from the signing of the Agreement in the White House last November 9 to the present moment when U.N.R.R.A. men and women are actually engaged in bringing hard-won assistance to the gallant people of Greece. This Government has endeavored in every way to support you and your staff to the fullest limit of our ability. This has not always been an easy task in the face of the pressing and staggering demands which the fighting of a deadly war on many fronts has placed and will continue to place upon our resources of manpower, of supplies, and of transportation. But we are determined that the sacrifices of the liberated peoples shall be rewarded and that, to the extent we have it in our power to help, these people shall promptly receive the clothing, food, and other supplies which they need to start life over.
I am confident that your inspiring leadership, together with the cooperation of the member Governments, will result in making U.N.R.R.A. an enduring example of international cooperation in action.
