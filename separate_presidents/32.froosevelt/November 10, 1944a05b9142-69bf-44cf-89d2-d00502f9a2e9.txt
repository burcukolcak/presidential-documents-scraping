Remarks to the Crowd Greeting the President at Union Station, Washington, D. C.
This is a very wonderful welcome home that you have given me on this rather rainy morning—a welcome that I shall always remember. And when I say a welcome home, I hope that some of the scribes in the papers won't intimate that I expect to make Washington my permanent residence for the rest of my life.
All these years—eight in the Navy Department, twelve in the White House—and four to come—will have a great effect on Washington. The city is very different from the Washington that I first came to in the first administration of President Cleveland.
So I want to tell you how glad I am to be here and say one word to you- especially the Government workers- for all that you are doing to win this war. And when I say especially Government workers, I don't overlook all the other people in the city who make it possible for them to come here and live here and work here.
So thanks very much.
