Congratulations to General Eisenhower on the Landings in North Africa.
Both personally and on behalf of the American people I send sincere congratulations to you and every member of your command on the highly successful accomplishment of a most difficult task.
Our occupation of North Africa has caused a wave of reassurance throughout the Nation not only because of the skill and dash with which the first phase of an extremely difficult operation has been executed, but even more because of the evident perfection of the cooperation between the British and American forces. Give my personal thanks to Admiral [Sir Andrew Browne]
