Congratulations to the Postmaster General on Trans-Pacific Sky Mail.
My dear Mr. Postmaster General:
Please convey to the people of the Pacific Coast the deep interest and heartfelt congratulations of an air-minded sailor. Even at this distance I thrill to the wonder of it all.
They tell me that the inauguration of the Trans-Pacific sky mail also celebrates the 100th anniversary of the arrival of the first clipper ship in San Francisco. The years between the two events mark a century of progress that is without parallel, and it is our just pride that America and Americans have played no minor part in the blazing of new trails. There can be no higher hope than that this heritage of courage, daring, initiative and enterprise will be conserved and intensified.
Very sincerely yours,
The Honorable,

The Postmaster General,

Washington, D.C.
