Letter to the United States Conference of Mayors.
My dear Sirs:
I am glad to have this opportunity to extend my greetings to the United States Conference of Mayors, and through your organization to thank the mayors of the various cities of this country for the help and support the cities have given the National Administration in carrying out its program for national recovery.
During the past year I have conferred, from time to time, with the official committees of the Conference in an attempt to appraise and consider those problems which mutually confront our several levels of government. Through this contact with the representatives of our larger urban areas, it has been possible to secure a first-hand picture of conditions existing in and facing municipal governments. This fine cooperation has enabled the Federal Government to develop national policies and programs which have taken local needs into consideration.
Our efforts along the road of economic recovery have been productive of substantial results. It is undoubtedly true that the coming session of Congress will give further attention to proposals involving unemployment relief, public works, unemployment insurance, old-age pensions and housing, all of which vitally affect the city governments. I cannot say what final action Congress will take with reference to these subjects, but I assure you the Federal Government is anxious to work effectively and cooperatively on all of these common problems.
It is through teamwork of all governmental units that victory may be attained.
I wish you all success in your discussions and regret that I cannot personally meet with you.
Very sincerely yours,
United States Conference of Mayors, Chicago, Illinois.
