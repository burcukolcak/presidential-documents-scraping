Rear-Platform Remarks at Grafton, W. Va.
I am glad to come back here. The last time I came through, there was no such thing as the Tygarts Valley Dam, and I am gladÂ· to see it now. I am not talking politics, but I am calling your attention to the fact that this dam up here is a pretty good boondoggling idea.
I am told by the engineer in charge that here in Grafton there are no people who want work who cannot get work. And so, as has been well said on a number of occasions this morning on the train, we are not here to defend the New Deal, we are here to proclaim it.
This is a very different sight from what I saw in West Virginia in 1932. I believe the country is well on the way not only toward recovery, but toward the kind of recovery that is going to stay.
