Statement on Labor Dispute in Captive Mines.
The President and the Administrator of National Recovery in a long conference with the captive mine owners made clear certain fundamentals in regard to the operation of captive mines.
1. The captive mines come under the Coal Code already signed by the commercial mine owners, except as to provisions of said Code relating to the sale of coal.
2. The workers in every captive mine can choose their own representatives for the purpose of collective bargaining.
3. Upon failure to agree on any point after such collective bargaining, the President will pass on the questions involved, and will in making decisions use the principle that captive mines must operate under conditions of work substantially the same in the broadest sense as those which obtain in the commercial mines, which represent 90 percent of coal production.
4. The President will ask the mine owners and workers to abide by such decisions.
5. The President will put into effect such Government assistance as may be necessary to carry out the decisions in fairness to owners and workers.
6. On or before Monday the President will propose this formally to the captive mine owners.
7. The owners have assured the President that they will enter into negotiations at once in good faith with representatives of their workers.
8. In the meantime and with realization that every effort at speedy ending of these matters is being sought, the President requests that work be continued and resumed and that order be maintained.
