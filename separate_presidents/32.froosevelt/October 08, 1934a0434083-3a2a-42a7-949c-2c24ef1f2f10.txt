Letter to the Annual Convention of the American Legion.
My dear Commander Hayes:
I was delighted to receive your very cordial invitation to attend and address the Sixteenth Annual National Convention of the American Legion to be held at Miami, Florida, commencing October twenty-second. I well recall meeting with the American Legion last year in Chicago when you were elected to your present high office. My reception there always will be keenly appreciated.
It is with sincere regret, therefore, that this year I find it will be impossible to join with the American Legion at Miami. Other commitments and pressure of public business preclude the acceptance of your invitation.
My failure to be there, however, will in no sense lessen my distinct interest in your proceedings. The American Legion is a significant American organization, patriotic in its concepts and strong in its influence. Comprised of veterans of the World War and perpetuating the memory of those who have passed on, you can well stand as a beacon to guide your country's further national security.
While I realize your interests are in many directions, our national welfare is paramount. I urge you to carry such a spirit into your convention. Your country expects this of you and I am confident it will not be disappointed.
I wish your convention every success.
Very sincerely yours,
National Commander E. A. Hayes,

The American Legion,

Indianapolis, Indiana.
