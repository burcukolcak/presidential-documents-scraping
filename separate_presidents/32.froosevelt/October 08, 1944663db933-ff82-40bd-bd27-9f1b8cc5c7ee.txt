Statement on the Death of Wendell Willkie.
The Nation will long remember Wendell Willkie as a forthright American. Earnest, honest, whole-souled, he also had tremendous courage. This courageâ€”which was his dominating trait-prompted him more than once to stand alone and to challenge the wisdom of counsels taken by powerful interests within his own party. In this hour of grave crisis the country loses a great citizen through his untimely passing.
