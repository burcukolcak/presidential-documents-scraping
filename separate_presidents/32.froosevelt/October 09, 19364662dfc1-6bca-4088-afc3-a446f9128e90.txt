Remarks at the Dowling School for Crippled Children, Minneapolis, Minn.
THIS welcome that you children have given me reminds me very much of the welcome that the children give me down in Warm Springs, Georgia. Down there, as up here, there are a lot of them in wheel-chairs and a lot of them with crutches and a lot of them with arm-rests, but they have the same kind of cheerful faces you have.
I am glad the Federal Government has been able to help the School of Minneapolis, especially in building the swimming pool. I hope that all of you will be able to learn to swim, because that is about the only exercise I can take, and I know how much you will enjoy it if you learn.
It is fine to come here today. I am glad to see all of you. I wish I could go through the School and see the work you are doing. Some day I know that I shall be able to come and have the time to see all that you are doing.
