A Message on Navy Day.
My dear Mr. Secretary:
I commend again to our countrymen the annual observance of Navy Day in accordance with the established custom of setting apart the birthday of Theodore Roosevelt for that purpose. On this eightieth anniversary of the birth of that distinguished American, it seems particularly fitting to pay tribute to the vision and foresight of one who always urged: "The work of upbuilding the Navy must be steadily continued."
We should rejoice that on this day when the Navy is at home to our .people that we are at peace with all the world. But within the past year unsettled world conditions have made it imperative that we take stock of our national defense and face the facts. This survey of defense requirements was brought to the attention of the Congress with the result that an increase in strength of the Navy was authorized in approximation of the needs and responsibilities of our country. I believe it entirely consistent with our continuing readiness to limit armaments by agreement, that we maintain an efficient Navy adequate in men and material to insure positive protection against any aggressor. The Fleet must be ready.
Navy Day brings vividly to mind my pleasant official and personal association with the Navy. The lasting impression that I received of the Navy's efficient work in the stress and strain of war, strengthens my faith in its capacity to meet emergencies. I wish again to express my thanks and that of my fellow countrymen for the Navy's past achievement. The competent leadership that directs our forces afloat and ashore is to be commended.
War will be avoided by all honorable means, but should it come, I feel assured that the efficiency and devotion to duty of officers and men of the Navy will more than justify the confidence of our citizens in their first line of defense.
Very sincerely yours,
The Honorable,

The Secretary of the Navy,

Washington, D. C.
