Franklin D. Roosevelt
October 18, 1940

Statement on the President's Personal Entrance into the Campaign.
In the speech of acceptance to the Democratic Convention on July 19, 1940, the President said:
"I shall not have the time or the inclination to engage in any purely political debate. But I shall never be loath to call the attention of the nation to deliberate or unwitting falsifications of fact."
There has been in this campaign, however, a systematic program of falsification of fact by the opposition. The President does not believe that it has been an unwitting falsification of fact. He believes it is a deliberate falsification of fact.
He has, therefore, decided to tell the American people what these misrepresentations have been and in what respect they are false. With that purpose in mind, the President will make five speeches between now and election day.
