Remarks at a Businessmen's Rally for Senator Wagner. Ebbets Field, Brooklyn, New York.
I wanted to come here for two reasons. You know I come from the State of New York, and I have made a series of inspection tours here. I come from the State of New York and I practiced law in New York City, but I have never been to Ebbets Field before. I have rooted for the Dodgers. And I hope to come back here some day and see them play.
But the chief reason I came here today is to pay a little tribute to my old friend Bob Wagner. We were together in the legislature—I would hate to say how long ago—thirty-some years ago, in the Senate of the State of New York, and we have been close friends ever since, I think largely because we had the same ideals of being of service to our fellow men.
If anybody knew and could visualize all the way through the help that Bob Wagner has been to mankind, there wouldn't be any question about asking him to go back to the Senate for six years more, to carry on the splendid service that he has rendered.
And so I just came here to say that word in his behalf. He deserves well of mankind.
Thanks ever so much.
