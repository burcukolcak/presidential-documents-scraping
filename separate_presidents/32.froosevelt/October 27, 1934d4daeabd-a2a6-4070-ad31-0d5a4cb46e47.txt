Franklin D. Roosevelt
October 27, 1934

Letter on Navy Day.
My dear Mr. Secretary:
It is gratifying to learn of the plans to observe Navy Day in accordance with the custom which has been followed annually since 1922 of setting apart the birthday of the late President Theodore Roosevelt for that occasion.
From the very beginning of our national life, the Navy has always been, and justly deserves to be, an object of special pride to the American people. Its record is indeed one to inspire such sentiments. I am very sure that the commemoration of this day each year tends to bring the Navy into closer contact with our people, from whom it draws its inspiration.
It is with real pleasure and a feeling of deep personal pride for our Navy that I send to the officers and men of the Navy the Nation's congratulations on this Navy Day, and I am certain that they will continue to justify the confidence of their countrymen and perpetuate the high endeavor, efficiency and tradition that has marked the service of the Navy to the Nation.
Very sincerely yours,
The Honorable,

The Secretary of the Navy,

Washington, D. C.
