Telegram about Governor Benson of Minnesota.
George W. Kelley,

Chairman, Working Newspapermen's Benson

Volunteer Committee,

St. Paul, Minn.
This is my reply to the telegram you and your associates sent me on October 26. Will you please advise them. I have read with great interest your telegram upon the character of the political campaign in Minnesota. Apart from every other consideration, it is encouraging to receive this further evidence that American newspaper men are taking an increasingly courageous and intelligent interest in the problems of government.
If the political writers of Minnesota newspapers are inferring that I have deliberately withheld approval from or disapproved the candidacy of your progressive governor for reelection, they are of course misinterpreting my attitude. I have repeatedly indicated the high esteem in which I hold Governor Benson, and the interest I take in his efforts to develop liberal governmental policies in Minnesota. There is no reason for the modification of that attitude.
As a matter of ultimate good for the nation there is every reason why liberals throughout the nation should be working this year in the closest of harmonious cooperation.
