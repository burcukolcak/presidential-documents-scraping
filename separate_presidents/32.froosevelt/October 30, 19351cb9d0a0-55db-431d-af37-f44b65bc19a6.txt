Statement Against Profiteering in Italian-Ethiopian War.
In dealing with the conflict between Ethiopia and Italy, I have carried into effect the will and intent of the Neutrality Resolution recently enacted by Congress. We have prohibited all shipments of arms, ammunition and implements of war to the belligerent Governments. By my public statement of October 5th, which was emphasized by the Secretary of State on October 10th, we have warned American citizens against transactions of any character with either of the belligerent Nations except at their own risk.
This Government is determined not to become involved in the controversy and is anxious for the restoration and maintenance of peace.
However, in the course of war, tempting trade opportunities may be offered to our people to supply material which would prolong the war. I do not believe that the American people will wish for abnormally increased profits that temporarily might be secured by greatly extending our trade in such materials; nor would they wish the struggles on the battlefield to be prolonged because of profits accruing to a comparatively small number of American citizens.
Accordingly, the American Government is keeping informed as to all shipments consigned for export to both belligerents.
