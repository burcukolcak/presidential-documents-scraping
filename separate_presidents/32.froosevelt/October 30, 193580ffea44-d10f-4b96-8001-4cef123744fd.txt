Tribute to Nurses.
My dear Doctor Parrish:
It has just come to my attention that some thirty-eight nurses, victims of an infantile paralysis epidemic in Los Angeles, are being cared for in the Los Angeles General Hospital and in the hospital of Physicians and Surgeons in Glendale. My heart goes out to these young sufferersâ€”living martyrs to their unselfish devotion to the nursing profession. I should greatly appreciate it if you would convey to each of them an expression of my fellow feeling for them in the sacrifice they have made and are making.
Any words of mine seem feeble indeed in the face of their affliction; and yet, I cannot restrain the impulse to record my appreciation of their heroism. Because of their suffering the suffering of others was alleviated. They will ever be held in honored reverence for their unselfish ministrations.
Very sincerely yours,
Doctor George Parrish,

Health Officer,

Los Angeles, California.
