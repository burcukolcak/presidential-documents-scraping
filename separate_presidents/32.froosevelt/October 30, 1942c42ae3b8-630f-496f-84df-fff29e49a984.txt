Franklin D. Roosevelt
October 30, 1942

The President Expresses the Hope That All Those Eligible Will Vote on Election Day.
I hope very much that the press and the radio will tell all citizens of the United States that the President hopes they will go to the polls next Tuesday and vote.
We are engaged in an all-out war to keep democracy alive. Democracy survives through the courage and fortitude and wisdom of many generations of fighting Americans. And that includes using not only bullets but also ballots.
I ask that employers- all over the countryâ€”will so arrange the work day, that they and all their employees can go to the polls and that there will be no deductions in pay for reasonable time necessarily taken to vote.
I have directed that those responsible for the operation of the Government's workshops- shipyards, navy yards, arsenals, ordnance depots, as well as the executive departments and agencies- should give all the employees an opportunity to vote without any loss of wages for the time away from work.
