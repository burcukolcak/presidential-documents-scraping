Rear-Platform Remarks at Cheyenne, Wyo., during a Drought Inspection Trip.
As you know, I have already had a very successful conference with Governor Miller in regard to the drought situation in Wyoming. That is in line with the conferences that I am having with the Governors of all those States which are affected by the present drought problem.
I was very glad to see, coming through this State on the U. P., that farther west the conditions are not so bad. I am sorry that I have not the time to inspect that part of the State, the northeast, where the drought problem has been very serious.
We are trying to tie in all of the various agencies that have to do with drought, the local authorities, the State Government and then the Federal Departments. That is why, on this train, we have the Secretary of Agriculture, the Administrator of Resettlement and the Administrator of Relief, all working together toward a program which we hope is going to make things better in the years to come.
As a matter of fact, of course, the problem in this State is not so serious as it was in 1934 and I am glad to see on this trip that we are much more prosperous, taking things by and large, than we were then.
One of the best indications of our increasing prosperity is the very large number of tourists that are moving around this part of the country this summer. In the national parks and in the national forests the actual number of people who are seeking recreation during the summer is greater than it was in 1929, and that is saying a lot.
The train is about to pull out. It has been good to see you. Good-bye.
