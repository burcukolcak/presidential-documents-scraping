Proclamation 2352â€”Proclaiming a National Emergency in Connection with the Observance, Safeguarding, and Enforcement of Neutrality and the Strengthening of the National Defense Within the Limits of Peace-Time Authorizations

Whereasa proclamation issued by me on September 5, 1939, proclaimed the neutrality of the United States in the war now unhappily existing between certain nations; and
Whereasthis state of war imposes on the United States certain duties with respect to the proper observance, safeguarding, and enforcement of such neutrality, and the strengthening of the national defense within the limits of the peacetime authorizations; and
Whereasmeasures required at this time call for the exercise of only a limited number of the powers granted in a national emergency:
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,President of the United States of America, do proclaim that a national emergency exists in connection with and to the extent necessary for the proper observance, safeguarding, and enforcing of the neutrality of the United States and the strengthening of our national defense within the limits of peacetime authorizations. Specific directions and authorizations will be given from time to time for carrying out these two purposes.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this eight day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-fourth.
