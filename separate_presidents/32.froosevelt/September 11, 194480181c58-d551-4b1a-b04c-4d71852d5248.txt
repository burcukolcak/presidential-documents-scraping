Statement on the Liberation of Luxembourg.
To no people who have borne the Nazi yoke can liberation mean more than those of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Ruthlessly attacked and occupied by the German military in May, 1940, their country was not only incorporated into the Third Reich and German citizenship thrust upon them, but their sons were forced to serve in the ranks and wear the hated uniform of their oppressors. With unparalleled sacrifice and fortitude the heroic Luxembourgers have resisted every Nazi effort to break their spirit. On the occasion of their release from tyranny and their return to the free institutions which they hold so dear, the American people salute the brave people of Luxembourg.
