Message to Congress on Benefit Rights of Workers Called into Active Service.
To the Congress:
The social gains of recent years, including insurance and other benefit rights, must be preserved unimpaired. The National Guard legislation, which I recently approved, contained provisions evidencing this policy in connection with benefit rights of workers who are called into active service, and a similar provision is contained in pending selective service legislation.
I recommend to the Congress early consideration of the problems thus recognized, and enactment of the necessary legislation incident to preserving insurance protection under the Social Security Act, the Railroad Retirement Act, and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, and to facilitate State action under the Federal-State unemployment insurance program.
The agencies administering the Federal acts have been considering the needed technical changes to meet these problems and are now ready to furnish recommendations to the Congress in this connection.
