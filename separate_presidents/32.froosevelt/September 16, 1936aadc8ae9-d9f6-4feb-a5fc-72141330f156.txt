Letter Thanking the American Labor Party for Its Support.
My dear friends:
I have learned with a sense of deep appreciation through your letter of August 29th that the American Labor Party, New York State, will throw its full support to me this year. It gives me much pleasure to become your candidate.
The assurance that your organization recognizes me as the leader of progressive forces in favor of humanity in government quickens the sense of responsibility on my part. The issues are clear-cut and sharply defined this year. Opposed to us are all of the forces of reaction and special privilege.
But the fight for democracy in our industrial economy and for the maintenance of our American democratic institutions against the attacks of predatory interests must go on without abatement. The loyal support which you pledge on behalf of the American Labor Party gives me new strength and new courage to continue the struggle and renewed faith that we shall not know defeat.
Very sincerely yours,

American Labor Party,

New York, N. Y.
