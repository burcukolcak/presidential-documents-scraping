Statement on the Seventieth Anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation.
I heartily congratulate the Negroes of the United States upon the seventieth anniversary of their emancipation. Their progress during these seventy years has been remarkable. They have contributed greatly to the economic development of the Nation and I am sure that as prosperity returns they will share proportionately in the greater security, increased comfort and happiness resulting therefrom.
