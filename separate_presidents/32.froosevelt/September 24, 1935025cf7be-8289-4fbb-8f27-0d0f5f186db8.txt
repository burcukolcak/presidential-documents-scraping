Letter on Navy Day.
My dear Mr. Secretary:
It is with pleasure that I learn of the plans to observe Navy Day in accordance with the annual custom of setting apart the birthday of the late President Theodore Roosevelt for that occasion. Arms, Ammunition and Implements of War
In the unsettled conditions existing throughout the world it is imperative that we should heed the needs of national defense. By the passage of the Vinson-Trammell Bill which authorizes the upbuilding of our Navy to the limits of existing treaties, our national legislation gave very definite expression of its purpose to increase the strength of the American Navy to a degree commensurate with America's needs, interests and responsibilities.
Happily recalling my own personal association with our Navy, I take pride in endorsing the commemoration of Navy Day this year and in expressing my own appreciation and that of our fellow countrymen in the Navy's past achievements; also the conviction that the officers and men of the Navy will continue to justify the faith and confidence that their civilian compatriots have always accorded them.
Very sincerely yours,
The Honorable,

The Secretary of the Navy,

Washington, D. C.
