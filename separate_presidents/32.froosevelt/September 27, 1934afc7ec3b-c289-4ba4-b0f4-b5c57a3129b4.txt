Greeting to the International Association of Chiefs of Police.
Mr. Chairman and Members of the International Association of Chiefs of Police:
It affords me a great deal of pleasure to address this brief personal message of greeting and best wishes to my friends of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.
I wish to commend your organization for the cooperation which it is furnishing in the great movement which the agencies of government—national, State and local—are now organizing against the forces of crime. No undertaking is more vital to the welfare of society at this time than that of the prevention and detection of crime. The social order cannot exist except upon the basis of a respect for and observance of the law, and it is only when the people of a country are secure in their homes and in the normal activities of their lives from the depredations of the criminal classes that national progress can be maintained.
This respect for law and this security are possible only when the administration of justice is entrusted to wise, upright, patriotic and courageous officials.
It is of great importance that the International Association of Chiefs of Police shall press forward its vigorous efforts directed toward the elevation of the standards of police institutions and officials. Permit me, therefore, to wish you success in your great work.
