Statement on the Prayer for Peace.
In the last week the White House has received many hundreds of telegrams from churchmen, clergy, and, in general, from the religious homes of America asking the President to proclaim and set aside a Day of Prayer.
The President asks the press to say in reply that he does not want to proclaim a Day of Prayer but that he hopes on this coming Sunday that the people of the United States will offer a prayer during the day for continued peace of the world. He would like the people throughout the country to join with him and his family in such a prayer.
