Statement by the President on Senate Resolution 99.
THE ADOPTION by the Senate of Senate Resolution 99 is further evidence that the country stands firm in its support of the North Atlantic Treaty. It reaffirms the basic principle of our foreign policy--that the security of the United States is intimately bound up with the security of other free nations.
The dear endorsement of the appointment of General Eisenhower and the plans to assign troops to his command shows that there has never been any real question but that this country would do its part in helping to create an integrated European defense force.
Our main task now is to get on with the job of building our own strength and help to build the strength of the free world--a job which we all agree should continue to be carried out through collaboration by the executive and the legislative branches of the Government.
Note: Senate Resolution 99 is published in the Congressional Record (vol. 97, p. 3282) and in the State Department Bulletin (vol. 24, p. 637).
