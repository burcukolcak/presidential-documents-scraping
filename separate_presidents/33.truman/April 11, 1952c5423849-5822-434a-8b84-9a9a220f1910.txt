Statement by the President on the 500th Anniversary of the Birth of Leonardo da Vinci.
ON April 15, 1952, associations in many countries dedicated to art, science, and scholarship will celebrate the 500th anniversary of the birth of Leonardo da Vinci, the illustrious Italian painter, sculptor, inventor, scientist, and humanist. His achievements have become the common heritage of all men and have left an indelible record in the history of Western civilization. He has impressed his influence on the culture of our own and many other nations.
By virtue of his wisdom, his creative energy, his zeal for the truth, and his devotion to the ideal of human dignity he helped provide new foundations for subsequent progress in the sciences and arts, in the mastery of the resources of nature, and in the acceptance of modern concepts of freedom and justice.
Italy and France, the nations with which da Vinci was most closely associated during his long life, are celebrating his anniversary on April 15. Since the American people have a common interest in the heritage of Western civilization which owes so much to da Vinci, it is fitting that we also take note of the anniversary with appropriate observances in our museums and other institutions of art, science, and learning.
