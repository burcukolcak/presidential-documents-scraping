Letter to the Speaker Transmitting Supplemental Estimate of Appropriations for the European Recovery Program.
Sir:
I have the honor to submit herewith for the consideration of the Congress a supplemental estimate of appropriation for the fiscal year 1948 in the amount of $4,245,000,000 for expenses of the European recovery program.
The Congress, by enacting the Economic Cooperation Act, has recognized the imperative need for prompt American assistance to the free peoples of Europe. For this purpose, appropriations of $4,300,000,000 for the first year of the European recovery program were authorized. I urge that this full amount, less $55,000,000 already appropriated by the Congress to prevent a break in the pipeline of essential supplies, be appropriated at this time.
The details of this estimate, the necessity therefor, and the reasons for its submission at this time are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, transmitted herewith, in whose comments and observations thereon I concur.

Respectfully yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Speaker of the House of Representatives]
Note: On June 28, 1948, the President approved the Foreign Aid Appropriation Act, 1949 (02 Stat. 1054).
The letter from the Director of the Bureau of the Budget is printed in House Document fro (Both Cong., 2d sess.).
