Special Message to the Senate Transmitting Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation with Italy.
To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith a treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation between the United States of America and the Italian Republic, together with a protocol and an additional protocol relating thereto, signed at Rome on February 2, 1948.
The enclosed treaty, together with the two related protocols, was negotiated on a basis of complete equality between the two Governments. It is comprehensive and is designed to provide an effective basis for the future development of cultural, business, and trade relationships between the two countries. I consider that this treaty is an important manifestation of the friendly relations which exist between this country and post-Fascist Italy, and that it confirms the determination of the two Governments to apply in their economic and cultural intercourse the liberal principles that are fundamental to the democratic way of life. I commend it to the early consideration of the Senate.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, a copy of each of two notes, signed and exchanged on the same date, and a report on the treaty made to me by the Acting Secretary of State.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: The treaty was favorably considered by the Senate on June 2, 1948, and after ratification entered into force on July 26, 1949. It was proclaimed by the President on August 5, 1949.
The text of the treaty is printed in the U.S. Statutes at Large (63 Stat. 2255).
