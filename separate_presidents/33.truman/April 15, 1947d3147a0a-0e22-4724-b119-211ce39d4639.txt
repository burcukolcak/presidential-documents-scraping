CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE MEDAL FOR MERIT TO CORDELL HULL
CORDELL HULL, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the United States as the Secretary of State from September 9, 1939 to December 6, 1941. With a high order of statesmanship based on deep loyalty to his country, Mr. Hull served with great distinction and selfless devotion during the years of crises and difficulties. He labored unceasingly through these years to create conditions for peace. At the same time, he endeavored to prepare the United States to meet the rising dangers from abroad. He contributed immensely to the Good Neighbor policy, which was to bear rich fruit in a tragic hour for the United States and the entire Western Hemisphere.

CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE MEDAL FOR MERIT TO CORDELL HULL
CORDELL HULL, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the United States as the Secretary of State from December 7, 1941 to November 30, 1944. After war came to the United States, Mr. Hull gave himself unsparingly to the war effort. He made diplomacy a powerful weapon in support of our armed strength. He made diplomacy also a potent instrument in laying the foundations of a stable and peaceful world order in the postwar era. As a tribute to his effective work in bringing about the establishment of an international organization, he is now known as the "Father of the United Nations."
