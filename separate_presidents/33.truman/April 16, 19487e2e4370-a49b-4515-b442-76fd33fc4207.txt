Proclamation 2779â€”National Farm Safety Week, 1948

Whereasneedless hazards on the farms of our Nation continue to cause thousands of accidents each year which could be prevented by a positive safety program; and
Whereasthese accidents, which annually cause some 18,000 farm residents to lose their lives, constitute an unnecessary and tragic waste of human life; and
Whereasthe reduction of accidents to a minimum cannot be achieved without the vigilance and efforts of those who are endangered:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the nation to observe the week commencing July 25, 1948, as national Farm Safety Week. I urgently request each member of every American farm family to accept responsibility for eliminating at least one possible source of accidents during that week. I also ask all organizations and persons interested in farm life and welfare to join in a concerted attack upon these menaces to the lives and happiness of American farmers and their families.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Doneat the City of Washington this 16th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-second.
