Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Extending the Lend-Lease Act.
THIS IS the third time that the Lend-Lease Act has been extended by the Congress--each time by overwhelming majorities.
This mighty instrument for victory is one of the growing monuments to the boldness, imagination and effective statesmanship of Franklin Roosevelt.
At a critical time in the history of this country, he saw the vital need for aiding those who were fighting against Axis aggression and oppression all over the world.
The wisdom and effectiveness of that vision are being shown every day on the battlefronts all over the world.
On the Western European front--the British, the French, the Dutch, the Belgians and other Allied forces have been equipped in part with lend-lease guns and other munitions; and, shoulder to shoulder with our men are fighting their way into the heart of Nazi Germany.
In Italy--American, British, Polish, Brazilian and other Allied armed forces are joined in a common effort to speed final victory.
On the eastern front--the Soviet forces, aided by lend-lease supplies, are striking blows which are breaking the back of Nazi military power.
In the Far East--the Chinese, the British, the Australians, the New Zealanders, the Dutch and other fighting Allies, have joined with us in a combined attack which is now beating at the doors of Tokyo.
Lend-lease has been an effective instrument to help assure a complete United Nations victory with the least cost in American and Allied lives.
Lend-lease will be carried on until the unconditional surrender or complete defeat of Germany and Japan.
Note: As enacted, the bill (H.R. 2013) is Public Law 31, 79th Congress (59 Stat. 52).
