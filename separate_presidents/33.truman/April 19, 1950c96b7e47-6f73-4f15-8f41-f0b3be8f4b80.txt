Whereasit is appropriate that on one day each year we offer public acknowledgment of the gratitude and love that we feel for our own mothers and of the reverence and respect that we feel for all mothers; and
Whereasin recognition of the fitness of such acknowledgment, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May of each year as Mother's Day, and has requested the President to issue a proclamation in commemoration of that day:

I also call upon the people generally to display the flag at their homes or other suitable places on Sunday, May 14, 1950, as a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country. Let all the sons and daughters of America pay tribute to their mothers on that day and renew their devotion to the ideals for which motherhood has always stood.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Doneat the City of Washington this 19th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth.
