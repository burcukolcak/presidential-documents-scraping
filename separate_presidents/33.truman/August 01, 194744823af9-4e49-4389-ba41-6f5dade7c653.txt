Remarks to Reporters Following the Death of the President's Mother
THE PRESIDENT. I merely wanted to make a few remarks to you this morning. I couldn't hold a press conference this week, but I wanted to say to you personally a thing or two that I couldn't very well say any other way, so I asked Charlie1to ask you to come in.
1Charles G. Ross, Secretary to the President.
I wanted to express to you all, and to your editors and your publishers, appreciation for the kindness to me during the last week.
I was particularly anxious to tell the photographers how nice they were to me, and to the family, and I didn't know any other way to do it but just call you in and tell you.
I had no news to give you, or anything else to say to you, except just that, and I felt like I owed it to you.
You have been exceedingly nice to me all during the whole business, and I hope you will believe it when I say to you that it is from the heart when I tell you that.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
Note: The President spoke in his office at the White House at 11:30 a.m. The meeting is carried in the White House Official Reporter's records as the President's one hundred and fourteenth news conference.
