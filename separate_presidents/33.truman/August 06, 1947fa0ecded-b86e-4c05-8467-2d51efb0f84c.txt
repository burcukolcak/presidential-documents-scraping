Memorandum of Disapproval of Bill Repealing the Ship Warrants Act.
I AM withholding my approval from the bill (H.R. 673) "To repeal certain provisions authorizing the establishing of priorities in transportation by merchant vessels."
The purpose of the bill is to repeal the Act of July 14, 1941 entitled "An Act to provide for priorires in transportation by merchant vessels in the interests of national defense, and for other purposes," as amended and extended (55 Stat. 591; 56 Stat. 371).
The Act in question, which was known as the Ship Warrants Act, authorized the War Shipping Administration to establish a system of ship warrants which became effective upon arrival by President Roosevelt on January 4, 1943. On June 6, 1946 the ship warrant rules and regulations were revoked and on July 25, 1947, the Act was repealed by Public Law No. 239.
Accordingly, this legislation is not necessary.
