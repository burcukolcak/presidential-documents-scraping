The President's News Conference
THE PRESIDENT. I have only a simple announcement to make. I can't hold a regular press conference today; but this announcement is so important I thought I would call you in.
Russia has declared war on Japan! That is all!
[Much applause and laughter, as the reporters raced out]
Note: President Truman's seventeenth news conference was held in his office at the White House at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, August 8, 1945. The White House Official Reporter noted that Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy and Secretary of State James F. Byrnes were special guests at this conference.
