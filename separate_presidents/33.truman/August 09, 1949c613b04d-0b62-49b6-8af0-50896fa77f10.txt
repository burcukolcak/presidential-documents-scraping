Toasts of the President and President Quirino at a Dinner in Honor of President Truman.
MR. PRESIDENT, I am extremely happy that you are not going home emptyhearted, and I am very sure you won't go home empty-handed, either.
I appreciate most highly this presentation, and I shall treasure it all my life, and give it to my daughter.
I want to drink to the health of the first President of the Philippine Republic who has visited the United States of America.
May he live long and happily, and be prosperous as the President of the Philippines.
Note: The President proposed this toast at a dinner given in his honor at the Statler Hotel in Washington by President Quirino. The toast proposed by President Quirino follows:
Mr. President, and gentlemen:
I have traveled 10,000 miles to be able to present in person a likeness of a man who has deep love for the Philippine people, and whose friendship we now enjoy. He is a true friend, a true man. The only way we can enjoy his friendship is to wish that God keep him in health.
I may go home empty-handed, but I am sure I will not go home emptyhearted.
I invite you, gentlemen, to join with me in wishing the President of the United States continued health.
