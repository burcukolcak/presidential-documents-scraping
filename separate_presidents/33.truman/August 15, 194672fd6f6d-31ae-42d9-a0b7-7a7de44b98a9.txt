Harry S. Truman
August 15, 1946

Statement by the President: The Jewish New Year.
TO ALL my fellow citizens of the Jewish faith I extend hearty greetings and good wishes on their New Year's Day.
Its celebration this year comes at a time when the United States and its allies are seeking to lay the foundation of lasting peace in the world. This task cannot be completed unless all persons, without distinction of race, language or religion, are made secure in the enjoyment of their inherent human rights. To this end, the treaties of peace now being discussed bind the nations who warred against human freedom to guarantee to all their peoples freedom of opinion, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of worship.
These freedoms are the heritage of centuries of civilization. All of us share the responsibility for seeing that they are extended to all mankind.
