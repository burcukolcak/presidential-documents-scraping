Statement by the President on Myron C. Taylor's Mission to the Vatican.
AT MY REQUEST the Honorable Myron C. Taylor is proceeding to Rome as my personal representative for further exchanges of views with His Holiness Pope Pius XII, on problems relative to the establishment of peace under a moral world order and to the alleviation of the human suffering still continuing in many parts of the world. Mr. Taylor has also been asked to hold conversations with other leaders on similar problems while he is in Europe.
The purpose of these further conversations, as on earlier occasions, is to gather for my guidance and assistance various views and impressions concerning existing conditions affecting peace and the relief of distress, and to obtain the energetic cooperation of all men and women of good will, whether in religion, in government, or in other activities of life, in the interest of progress toward solution of these problems.
I am seeking by this means a greater clarification of the nature of the vital tasks that confront each of the nations that have pledged themselves to cooperate in the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security and to promote economic and social advancement. I wish to have the benefit of the constructive views and suggestions of leaders everywhere, to the end that the thought and action of the United States as to world affairs may contribute to that moral world order of peace and security and well-being for which we and the other United Nations struggled to victory in World War II.
