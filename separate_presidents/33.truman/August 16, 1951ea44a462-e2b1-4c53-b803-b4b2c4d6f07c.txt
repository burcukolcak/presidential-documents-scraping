By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 215 of the Public Health Service Act, approved July 1, 1944 (58 Stat. 690), and as President of the United States, I hereby amend the regulations relating to commissioned officers and employees of the Public Health Service prescribed by Executive Order No. 9993 of August 31, 1948 (13 F.R. 5093), as amended by Executive Order No. 10031 of January 26, 1949 (14 F.R. 377), as portions of Chapter I, Title 42, Code of Federal Regulations.
Section 21.155 of Subpart H of Part 21 of said regulations is amended to read as follows:
§21.155 Separation on grounds of disloyalty. The loyalty to the Government of the United States of commissioned officers of the Service shall be subject to investigation, review, and determination in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order No. 9835 of March 21, 1947, entitled "prescribing Procedures for the Administration of an Employees Loyalty Program in the Executive Branch of the Government," as amended by Executive Order No. 10241 of April 28, 1951. If the Administrator finds, in accordance with the standards and procedures prescribed by, or adopted pursuant to, the said Executive Order No. 9835 as amended (including those relating to the right of appeal to the Loyalty Review Board for an advisory recommendation), that, on all the evidence, there is a reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of the officer involved to the Government of the United States, such officer shall be separated from the Service.
