CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE MEDAL FOR MERIT TO DAVID K. NILES
DAVID K. NILES, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the United States. Mr. Niles, as Adviser on labor problems to the War Production Board, with his immediate perception and keen insight into the complex labor-management problems which were created by a wartime economy, aided immeasurably in uniting both labor and management in the collaborative production of the weapons of war. In this task he won the full confidence and high regard of all those with whom he dealt by the display of an essential fairness and desire to understand and reconcile the problems of worker and employer, and by communicating to them his own zeal in the American principle of democratic action. His numerous contributions in this important field strengthened and vitalized the spirit of war workers and their employers on the home front in forging the bond with the fighting front which made victory possible. He gave unstintingly of his time and efforts, and handled all of his assignments with finesse and dexterity. Mr. Niles worked assiduously, and rendered invaluable services to his country.
