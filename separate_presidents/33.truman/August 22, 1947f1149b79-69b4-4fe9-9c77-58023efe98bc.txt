Executive Order 9887â€”Designating Public International Organizations Entitled to Enjoy Certain Privileges, Exemptions, and Immunities
By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act, approved December 29, 1945 (59 Stat. 669), and having found that the United States participates in the Preparatory Commission for the International Refugee Organization under the authority of section 5 of Public Law 146, 80th Congress, 1st Session, and that section 1 of that Act authorizes me to accept membership for the United States in the International Refugee Organization, which membership I have duly accepted, I hereby designate the Preparatory Commission for the International Refugee Organization and its successor, the International Refugee Organization, as public international organizations entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions and immunities conferred by the said Act.
The designation of the above-named organizations as public international organizations within the meaning of the said International Organizations Immunities Act is not intended to abridge in any respect privileges and immunities which such organizations may have acquired or may acquire by treaty or Congressional action.
This order shall become effective immediately as to the Preparatory Commission for the International Refugee Organization, and shall become effective as to the International Refugee Organization on the date that organization comes into existence in accordance with the terms of its Constitution.
