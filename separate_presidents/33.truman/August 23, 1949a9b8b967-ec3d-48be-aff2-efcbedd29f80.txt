Remarks to a Group of South Carolinians.
Ladies and gentlemen, and distinguished Members of the Congress from South Carolina:
It certainly is a most cordial invitation which you have given to me, and one which it would be exceedingly hard to refuse.
I hope that some time when business is not so pressing on me as it is at present that I may pay another visit to South Carolina.
I have been there many a time. I was there at an azalea festival with John Garner, and I have been there on several other occasions, when I didn't attract so much attention as I do now; and I enjoyed the visits every time. People are naturally hospitable and cordial.
I am very happy to have you here and to meet each and every one of you. I hope that you will do me the favor of allowing me to shake hands with you as a group, for the simple reason that I have several delegations coming in today--more than usual. As you know, I shake hands with 30 or 40,000 people every year. Last year I shook hands with 200,000, and the arm's getting kinda tired. So, if you will allow me to shake hands with you collectively instead of individually, I will consider it a personal favor.
And I will count that in your favor when I go to make up my mind as to whether I will come or not.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 11:10 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House.
