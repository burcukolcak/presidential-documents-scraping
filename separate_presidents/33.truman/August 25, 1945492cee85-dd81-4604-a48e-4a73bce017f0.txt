Statement by the President Concerning Veterans Hospitals.
A PROGRAM for the construction of new hospital beds for the treatment of veterans was recently recommended by the Veterans Administration.
When these recommendations reached my desk I had decided to accept the resignation of General Hines as Veterans Administrator and to appoint General Omar N. Bradley as his successor.
In all fairness to General Bradley I thought he should have an opportunity to make his own recommendations, as he would be held responsible for his administration. In order that he might have this opportunity, I approved the program for the construction of 29,000 beds but withheld approval of any locations.
I expect General Bradley will expedite the submission of a program recommending locations for the beds. This will be acted on as promptly as possible.
