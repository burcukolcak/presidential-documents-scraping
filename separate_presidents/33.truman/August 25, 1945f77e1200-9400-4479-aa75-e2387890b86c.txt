Joint Statement Following Discussions With President de Gaulle of France.
THE VISIT of General de Gaulle, President of the Provisional Government of the French Republic, to the President of the United States of America, has been marked by an important exchange of views between the two Chiefs of State, who, in the course of their first meeting, expressed their sentiments of mutual high esteem.
The conversations, which began immediately after General de Gaulle's arrival in Washington, have made possible a thorough discussion of a wide range of subjects, among them those of most immediate interest to the two governments.
Subsequent to the second conversation between President Truman and General de Gaulle, and at their request, the Secretary of State, Mr. Byrnes, and Foreign Minister, Monsieur Bidault, had during two days a full and frank discussion of political and economic questions in which the two countries are deeply interested.
Following those discussions, both the Chiefs of State, and the Secretary of State and the French Foreign Minister, have fully recognized, in the course of a further meeting, the fundamental harmony between French and American aims in the construction of the postwar world and have expressed their readiness to act in accordance with this mutual understanding by establishing an even closer cooperation between the two countries.
