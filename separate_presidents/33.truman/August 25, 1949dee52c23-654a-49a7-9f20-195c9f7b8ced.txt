Remarks to the Delegates of Girls Nation.
IT IS a very great pleasure to have you young ladies here this morning. One young lady, who lives in South Carolina, asked me if in 5 years she might be an ambassador. I told her that she might, if she studied hard and learned all about foreign affairs. But, I couldn't make her any promises because that is a year or two beyond the time when my term will expire.
I hope you have had a good and instructive tour here. I hope you will know more about government when you leave than when you came. People ought to understand everything in connection with this Government of theirs, for the simple reason that it is the greatest government in the history of the world. It is the best government in the history of the world, and it will continue to be that best government if you young people will keep informed on it, and keep up with it, and on election day go and vote your sentiments, so that the continuation of this Republic will be assured.
Because, the responsibility of government-this Government--in the next few years is going to be on your shoulders. All of us old people will be out of the way by that time, and you not only may be able to be an ambassador, you might have this terrible job which I have; that is, President of the United States, and you might get a chance to live over there in that great white jail, with the balcony and everything.
It's a lot of fun to contemplate. Most of the time it is a lot of fun to do it, but it means a tremendous amount of hard work. You have got to be willing to work not only 8 hours a day but 18 hours a day, and sometimes 24.
Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 12:10 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. The delegates were in Washington attending the Third Girls Nation of the American Legion Auxiliary.
