Letter to George E. Allen Concerning the Liquidation of War Agencies.
Dear Mr. Allen:
As the various war agencies are dissolved from time to time, it will become necessary to liquidate such of their functions as are not transferred to the permanent Departments. This will involve unexpended funds, surplus personnel, and surplus equipment.
Many suggestions have been made as to the most efficient and economical method of carrying on this liquidation.
I have designated you as my Personal Representative to study the whole problem, and to make recommendations to me as to the best means of accomplishing liquidation.

Very sincerely yours,

HARRY S TRUMAN.
[Mr. George E. Allen, 1522 K Street NW., Washington 5, D.C.]
