Letter to Byron Price Requesting Him To Study Relations Between U.S. Forces of Occupation and the German People.
Dear Mr. Price:
In accordance with our previous discussions, I am asking you to go to Germany as my personal representative to survey the general subject of relations between the American forces of occupation and the German people. You are hereby authorized to visit any place you deem necessary for this purpose.
I hope you will place yourself at the disposal of General Eisenhower and General Clay for such advice and help as they may want in this field.
At the end of your assignment, the duration of which you yourself will determine, I request you to submit to me your report and recommendations.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
