Statement by the President Making Public a Report Entitled "The Military Chaplaincy."
IT IS gratifying to know that those who are serving the colors have readily available opportunities to receive spiritual advice and guidance.
On behalf of the American public, I want to congratulate our chaplains on the fine work they are doing--on foreign shores, ships at sea, and in the front lines of the Korean battleground.
The military chaplain braves many dangers as he does his work serving God and the young men who are defending the Nation's spiritual traditions.
I hope that our religious leaders and our public will read this report of the President's Committee thoroughly and will support its recommendations for the strengthening of the chaplaincy.
I pray with them for the safety and security of our young men and women in the Armed Forces, and ask that they support these men and women with all their resources and all their faith.
Note: The report of the President's Committee on Religion and Welfare in the Armed Forces, dated October 1, 1950, and entitled "The Military Chaplaincy," was transmitted to the President on November 28 (Government Printing Office, 1950, 43 pp.).
For the President's statement on appointing additional members of the Committee, see Item 3a.
