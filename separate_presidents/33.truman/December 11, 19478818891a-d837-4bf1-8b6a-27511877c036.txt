Citation Accompanying the Distinguished Service Medal Presented to Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz.
THE PRESIDENT of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Gold Star in lieu of the Fourth Distinguished Service Medal to
FLEET ADMIRAL CHESTER WILLIAM NIMITZ, UNITED STATES NAVY
for service as set forth in the following
CITATION:
For exceptionally meritorious service to the Government of the United States in duties of great responsibility as Commanderin-Chief, United States Pacific Fleet and Pacific Ocean Areas, from August 1945, and as Chief of Naval Operations from December 1945, to December 1947. With his primary and immediate objective the difficult task of reducing the most powerful Navy in history to a fraction of its wartime' peak, Fleet Admiral Nimitz administered not only the rapid demobilization of vast numbers of personnel and vessels, but also the programs for the establishment and maintenance of Active and Reserve Fleets with the potential strength and readiness required to support our national policy. Responsible for the organizational readjustment and training in all fields of Naval interest, Fleet Admiral Nimitz rendered distinguished service to his country during this critical period by insuring to the greatest possible extent the Navy's ability to maintain and further the security of the Nation.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: The presentation was made by the President in a ceremony at the White House at 3:30 p.m.
