CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF

THE MEDAL FOR MERIT

TO

RALPH K. DAVIES
RALPH K. DAVIES, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the United States. As Deputy Petroleum Administrator, Mr. Davies organized and directed the unique government-industry combination that achieved one of the outstanding victories of the war--the assurance of petroleum for every military and essential civilian need of the United Nations. Under his guidance, this unprecedented partnership furnished the United Nations with their most vital and most used munition. As a member of the President's Committee on Oil, Mr. Davies played a leading part in formulating and negotiating an international oil agreement, executed by officials of the United States and Great Britain. To these high duties Mr. Davies brought profound oil knowledge, an incisive intellect, rare vision, the quiet power of a gifted organizer and executive, the courageous devotion of a man characterized by unflinching determination, and a deep sense of public service.
