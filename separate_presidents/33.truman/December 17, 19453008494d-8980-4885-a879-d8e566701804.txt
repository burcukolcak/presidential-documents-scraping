Veto of Bill Raising the Rank of Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs of Naval Bureaus.
The House of Representatives:
I return herewith, without my approval, H.R. 1862, the principal purpose of which would be to give to chiefs of naval bureaus the rank of vice admiral and to the assistant chiefs of naval bureaus the rank of rear admiral.
This enactment would extend preferential rank and retirement benefits to a particular group in one of the branches of our armed forces, and would not take into account the matter of rank and other benefits for personnel holding comparable assignments within other branches. This is piecemeal legislation. The time has arrived when we must consider all branches of our armed forces in the enactment of laws governing rank, promotion, and other privileges and benefits and conditions of service. The matter of increased permanent rank for chiefs of bureaus of the Navy Department and their assistants should await decision by the Congress on the matter of the organization and composition of our whole post-war military establishment and consideration of the problem of suitable rank for higher commands and staff assignments in the ground, sea, and air forces.
