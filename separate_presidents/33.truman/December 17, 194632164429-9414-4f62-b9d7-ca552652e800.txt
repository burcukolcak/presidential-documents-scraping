Letter to Granville Conway Asking Him To Serve as Coordinator of Emergency Export Programs.
My dear Captain Conway:
Last year, when you occupied the position of War Shipping Administrator, I appointed you Chairman of the Interagency Committee on Export Transportation. In that capacity you coordinated the work of all agencies concerned with the shipment of grain, grain products, and coal. Under your leadership, these Government agencies succeeded in carrying out export programs of grain and coal of unprecedented magnitude.
Once again, we are faced with the problem of achieving large export goals in spite of serious obstacles. These obstacles are different, but no less serious than last year. This year, for example, we have a surplus of grain; but the export program will not succeed unless it is given central direction. Whatever the problems, I am determined that our shipments of these critically needed products must be at maximum capacity for the coming months.
For that reason I have asked you to return to Government service for approximately ninety days to assume the post of Coordinator of Emergency Export Programs. As such, I wish you to coordinate the work of all agencies concerned and to see that these programs are carried out successfully. To this end, you are authorized to call on all agencies to use their full legal powers and to take whatever steps are necessary. You can count on the cooperation of all concerned, and I know that with this cooperation you will fulfill your mission completely.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Captain Granville Conway, The Cosmopolitan Shipping Company, 42 Broadway, New York, N.Y.]
