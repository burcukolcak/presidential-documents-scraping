CITATION ACCOMPANYING THE AWARD OF

THE MEDAL FOR MERIT

TO

MYRON C. TAYLOR
MYRON C. TAYLOR had achieved a brilliant career in law, industry and finance before he entered the difficult field of diplomacy. The world had known him as a leading figure in American business. At a time of bitter industrial strife, with the vision of a statesman he worked effectively to stabilize labor-management relations and in that sphere of complex and conflicting interests set a pattern out of which grew a more equitable relationship between employer and employee. Through all the active years of a busy life, in peace and in war, this remarkable man with a deep sense of public service has been a patron of the arts and sciences and' a liberal benefactor in the fields of education and philanthropy. Happily he is now in the zenith of his powers--a hale veteran in high service. As a diplomatist Mr. Taylor has been the Personal Representative of two Presidents of the United States to His Holiness the Pope with the rank of Ambassador. On many missions to His Holiness and to other leaders in church and state throughout Europe he has labored diligently with men of good will in parallel efforts to promote peace and concord among nations torn asunder by jealousy, hatred and ill will and to ameliorate the misery which inevitably follows in the wake of war. He has carried out his manifold and arduous duties with selfless disregard of incessant demands upon his own health and strength. Resolute in action, firm in principle, an enlightened economist with a passion for justice, Mr. Taylor, through a long and versatile career, has earned the accolade of his countrymen whom he has served faithfully and well wherever duty called him.
