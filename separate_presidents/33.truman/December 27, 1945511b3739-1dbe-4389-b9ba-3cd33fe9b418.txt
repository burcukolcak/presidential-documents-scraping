Letters to the Members of the Board of Directors on the Termination of the Smaller War Plants Corporation.
[ Released December 27, 1945. Dated November 1, 1945 ]
Dear Maury:
As you know, in line with my reorganization plans, the Smaller War Plants Corporation's functions are being transferred to other agencies. But there is one more job I would like for you to do for small business. It is in connection with little business in world trade.
Sometime ago I authorized you to take a trip to the countries of the Pacific. The purpose of the Mission was to make a report to me concerning the development of small business in these countries and the possibility of stimulating international trade between them and small businesses at home. Particularly, I am interested in the development of American small business in the field of international trade.
The countries to be visited by you are the Philippines, China, Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.
It is assumed, of course, that you will work closely with representatives of the Department of State in each country which you visit.
I want to congratulate you on the job that you have done as Chairman of the Smaller War Plants Corporation and for the work you have done for small business.
With best wishes, I am
Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Maury Maverick, Chairman and General Manager, Smaller War Plants Corporation]
Dear Mr. Howington:
Your excellent service with the War Production Board is well known to me. I, however, am especially mindful of the work you have done as a member of the Board of Directors of the Smaller War Plants Corporation from the very day of its inception.
Small business is the keystone of the free enterprise system. I compliment you particularly on the work that you have done in the matter of war production and in harnessing the small plants of America for that purpose.
In reorganizing the Government, we have concluded that it is appropriate that the duties of the Smaller War Plants Corporation be taken over by other established branches of the Government. I am sure I will have your cooperation in this.
Thanking you for your great service to America, I am

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable James T. Howington, Vice Chairman, Board of Directors, Smaller War Plants Corporation]
Dear Judge Rowe:
This is to assure you of my appreciation for your work while a member of the Board of Directors of the Smaller War Plants Corporation. You, as a banker and as a lawyer, know the problems of small organizations.
In reorganizing the Government, we have concluded that it is appropriate that the duties of the Smaller War Plants Corporation be taken over by other established branches of the Government. I am sure I will have your cooperation in this.
I wish to compliment and thank you for your period of service and to assure you that I deeply appreciate it.
With best wishes, I am

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable C. Edward Rowe, Member, Board of Directors, Smaller War Plants Corporation]
Dear Pat:
We all appreciate very much the fact that you came here to Washington, leaving your heavy duties as President of the McDonough Steel Company, to serve on the Board of Directors of the Smaller War Plants Corporation.
You have worked hard, you have done your duty, and it has been an aid of the first order to war production.
Today I wrote your Chairman, Mr. Maury Maverick, about the study which I wished him to make in China. You are invited to go on this mission also, because of your knowledge of little plants, and because of the fact that you understand industrial production from the smaller business viewpoint.
I would like you to go with Mr. Maverick to assist him in making the report, which I know will be of great value.
Again let me assure you of my appreciation of your great service to the Government of the United States.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Patrick W. McDonough, Member, Board of Directors, Smaller War Plants Corporation]
Dear Larry:
I remember with great pleasure the time we served together in the Congress of the United States.
The Smaller War Plants Corporation, under present plans of reorganization, will have its powers assumed by other organizations. But I cannot fail to say to you that your work with the Smaller War Plants Corporation has been of great benefit to small business and the free enterprise system. I appreciate what you have done for a year as a member of the Board of Directors of the Smaller War Plants Corporation.
With best personal good wishes, I am,

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Laurence Arnold, Member, Board of Directors, Smaller War Plants Corporation]
