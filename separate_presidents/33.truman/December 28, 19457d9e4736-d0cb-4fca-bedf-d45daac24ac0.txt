Executive Order 9670â€”Establishing the Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge
WHEREAS on November 29, 1945, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the United States Department of the Interior entered into an agreement providing for the transfer by the Authority to the Department of certain rights with respect to the lands therein designated and described in the counties of Henry, Benton, Humphreys, and Decatur, Tennessee, so that such lands might be reserved and used as a wildlife refuge, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and subject to my approval of the agreement and my establishment of the contemplated refuge; and
WHEREAS I have this day approved the said agreement between the Tennessee Valley Authority and the United States Department of the Interior; and
WHEREAS it appears that the establishment of the wildlife refuge contemplated by the agreement will further the purposes of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act (45 Stat. 1222) and is in the public interest:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, I hereby reserve and set apart for the use of the Department of the Interior as a refuge and wildlife management area for migratory birds and other wildlife the lands designated and described for that purpose in the said agreement of November 29, 1945, between the Tennessee Valley Authority and the United States Department of the Interior, such reservation to be in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of the said agreement.
This reservation shall be known as the Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge.
