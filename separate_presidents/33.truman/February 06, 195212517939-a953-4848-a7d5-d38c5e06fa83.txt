Statement by the President on the Death of King George VI.
A WORLD personage who maintained the highest traditions of the English constitutional monarchy passes in the death of His Majesty King George VI.
From his accession to the throne through all the ills which beset the world throughout the years of his reign--including the most disastrous war in history--he played his part nobly and with full understanding of the responsibility which was his. His heroic endurance of pain and suffering during these past few years is a true reflection of the bravery of the British people in adversity.
The King was ever conscious of his obligations as sovereign of a nation which through centuries has been the champion of personal liberty and those free institutions which ruthless dictators despise. He shared to the end of his reign all the hardships and austerities which evil days imposed on the brave British people. In return he received from the people of the whole Commonwealth a love and devotion which went beyond the usual relationship of a King and his subjects. This relationship flowed from the kindness of the King's heart and his complete dedication to those he both ruled and served.
The visit of the late King and his gracious Queen to this country heightened the good relations between our two peoples. Then there followed the visit last year of Her Royal Highness, now Queen Elizabeth II. It is a commentary on present day democracy that the daughters of the King of England and the President of the United States could exchange visits on a basis of friendship and mutual understanding and good will.
My deepest sympathy goes out to the British people. God bless Queen Elizabeth and may her father's exemplary memory provide the courage and inspiration she will need in the great responsibilities that lie before her.
