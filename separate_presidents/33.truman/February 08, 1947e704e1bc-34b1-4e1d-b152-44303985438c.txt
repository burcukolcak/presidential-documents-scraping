Statement by the President Announcing Further Steps in Aid of Highway Safety.
AT THE President's Highway Safety Conference in Washington last May, an "Action Program" was formulated to unite all States and communities in a campaign for safe and efficient highway transportation. Three national committees were established, representing State officials, civil organizations, and the Federal agencies concerned with highway matters, to coordinate the efforts of their respective groups.
These committees have suggested to me the desirability of following up the conference this year with a meeting to appraise progress and to devise whatever additional plans may be necessary to promote wider adoption of the "Action Program" recommendations.
Accordingly, I have asked Major General Philip B. Fleming, the Federal Works Administrator, who served as Conference Chairman, to reconstitute the Committee on Conference Reports as an "Action Program" group for this purpose, and to arrange a meeting in Washington during June.
At that time, most of the 44 State legislatures meeting this year will have completed their work. The meeting therefore will provide each State with a timely opportunity to report its progress toward enactment of uniform laws on driver licensing and other matters vital to safety, as recommended in the "Action Program."
I have written to all Governors requesting their continued cooperation in this important campaign.
