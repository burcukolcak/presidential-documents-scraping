Harry S. Truman
February 13, 1951

Remarks to a Group of Trainees from NATO Countries.
I WOULD LIKE to say to you young men that this we appreciate. I think this is the best public relations between nations that can possibly be carried on. I understand that we have exchanges in the other countries, doing over there just what you have been doing here. When we get better acquainted, we learn to understand each other, and at your age is the time to get a perfect understanding of what people are like and what they are trying to do.
Our only ambition in the world is for peace, and a lasting peace. We have no designs on any nation, either for territory, conquest, or otherwise. We want to see everybody happy. If we can accomplish that, we will have lasting peace. And I hope you young gentlemen will go back and work for just that.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Note: The President spoke at 3:10 p.m. in his office at the White House to eight cadets from North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries who were about to receive training in the armed forces of the United Nations.
