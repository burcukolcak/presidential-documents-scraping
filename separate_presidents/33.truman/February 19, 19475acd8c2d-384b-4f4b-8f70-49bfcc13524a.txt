Special Message to the Congress on Termination of Emergency and Wartime Powers.
To the Congress of the United States:
During the year and a half that have elapsed since the defeat of our last enemy in battle, we have progressively eliminated the great majority of emergency controls over the Nation's economy. The progress of reconversion now makes it possible to take an additional step toward freeing our economy of war-time controls.
Accordingly, I am recommending that the Congress repeal certain temporary statutes still in effect by virtue of the emergencies proclaimed by the President in 1939 and 1941, and I have requested the executive departments and agencies to cease operations under powers derived from certain permanent statutes that are effective only during emergencies, to the extent that such operations are related to the 1939 and 1941 emergencies.
The recommendations I here present for the consideration of the Congress will, if accepted, materially assist in further freeing the country of war controls and will help make possible an early ending of the emergencies. I have under continuing study the question of terminating the emergencies proclaimed in 1939 and 1941, and intend to take action as soon as circumstances permit.
In my recent message to the Congress on the State of the Union I outlined the following program with respect to the termination of emergency and war-time powers:
"Two groups of temporary laws still remain: The first are those which by Congressional mandate are to last during the 'emergency'; the second are those which are to continue until the termination of the War.
"I shall submit to the Congress recommendations for the repeal of certain of the statutes which by their terms continue for the duration of the 'emergency.' I shall at the same time recommend that others within this classification be extended until the state of war has been ended by treaty or by legislative action. As to those statutes which continue until the state of war has been terminated, I urge that the Congress promptly consider each statute individually, and repeal such emergency legislation where advisable."
Accordingly, I now submit recommendations with respect to more than 100 laws which are affected by the limited emergency declared September 8, 1939, or the unlimited emergency declared May 27, 1941.
In the case of these statutes that remain in force until termination of the war, I have directed the executive departments and agencies to assist the Congress in its consideration of these statutes, individually, by making available full information concerning them to the appropriate Congressional committees. The work done on this subject in the 79th Congress by the Committees on the Judiciary of both Houses, with the assistance of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion, the Department of Justice, and other Government agencies should offer valuable aid to the Congress in accomplishing the task which remains. At a later date it may prove desirable to send a further communication to the Congress concerning these statutes.
Emergency laws dealt with in this message fall into five broad classes: (a) Temporary statutes which are no longer needed, and which consequently should be repealed forthwith; (b) Permanent statutes under which operations related to the 1939 or 1941 emergencies have been or are being discontinued, but which should remain for possible use during future emergencies; (c) Statutes appropriating funds, which should, when the funds are no longer required, be handled by rescission of funds rather than by repeal of the statutes; (d) Statutes which should be temporarily extended by the Congress pending consideration of permanent legislation or other dispositions as indicated below; (e) Statutes which should continue in force for the period or purpose stipulated.
In appendices to this message the statutes under reference are enumerated according to the above classifications.
A. Temporary Statutes Which Should Be Repealed
I recommend the outright repeal of the 24 statutes or portions thereof specified in Appendix A. To a greater or lesser degree, all these statutes were designed to meet special problems of the war which no longer face us. It should be noted, however, that repeal of one of these laws will restore customs duties over certain commodities. In repealing it, the Congress should provide for the customary thirty days' notice before duty changes become effective.
B. Permanent Statutes Effective Only During An Emergency
The 36 laws enumerated in Appendix B are permanent legislation but come into force only during emergencies. Many of them were enacted during or before the first World War. Nothing requires their removal from our body of permanent law at this time, and it is preferable that operations conducted under them by virtue of the 1939 and 1941 emergencies should lapse rather than that the statutes should be repealed.
I have requested the head of each executive department and agency to discontinue at the earliest possible moment and in any event not later than March 15, 1947, the exercise of such powers as are derived, from these statutes, by virtue of the existence of the emergencies of 1939 and 1941.
C. Statutes Appropriating Funds
When appropriated funds are no longer required, it is the established procedure of the Congress to rescind these funds rather than to repeal the appropriation acts. On six occasions since the surrender of Japan I have recommended that the Congress rescind certain appropriated funds, and I shah continue to make recommendations for rescission of funds whenever possible.
Dependent upon the emergencies of 1939 and 1941 are 20 appropriation provisions listed in Appendix C. Expenditures under two of these acts have already ceased. Expenditures under twelve others will be terminated as rapidly as possible, and appropriate recommendations for rescission will be made.
In the case of four acts making appropriations for roads under the Defense Highway Act of 1941, after the end of the emergency these funds will continue to be needed by the Federal Works Agency for maintenance of access road projects until June 30, 1947, completion of access road projects now under construction, strategic network projects, and necessary advance engineering. I shall shortly transmit a budgetary communication in the usual form for this purpose.
In the case of the appropriation acts by which funds were provided for clerical assistance to Senators and for the Capitol police force, this is, of course, a matter which exclusively concerns the Congress.
D. Statutes Which Should Be Temporarily Extended
In the case of most of the 12 statutes listed in Appendix D, the Congress may wish to consider permanent legislation. In order to preserve existing activities and conditions until the Congress has had an opportunity to consider such legislation, I recommend the temporary extension of these statutes until June 30, 1948. In a few cases, termination on an indicated date appears desirable even though permanent legislation is not contemplated. The reasons for temporary extension in each case, the period of extension requested, and the executive departments and agencies interested are set forth in Appendix D.
E. Statutes Remaining in Force for the Period or Purpose Stipulated
Of the remaining 10 statutes affected by the existence of the emergencies, five will continue in force for a stipulated period after the emergencies have been declared at an end, and two have no termination provisions. The remaining statutes consist of one mandatory law under which operations cannot be discontinued during the emergencies (Act of July 2, 1940); and another two laws which are needed until the end of the emergencies (Act of June 29, 1936, and Act of March 8, 1946). The five statutes with terminal provisions beyond the emergencies should be allowed to remain in force for the periods stipulated by their terms; the two statutes without termination provisions should continue for the limited purposes provided; and the remaining statutes should be permitted to lapse according to their terms.
These statutes are enumerated in Appendix E, which states the purpose for which each of these laws will be needed and lists the executive departments or agencies concerned.
