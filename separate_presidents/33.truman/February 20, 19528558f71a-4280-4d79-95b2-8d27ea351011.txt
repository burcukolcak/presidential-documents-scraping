Memorandum Concerning the President's Airport Commission.
Memorandum for the Heads of all Executive Departments and Agencies :

I HAVE today appointed a temporary commission to formulate recommendations for me concerning the location and use of airports. This is a matter which concerns me very much, not only at the moment but as a long term proposition.
I would like all Departments and Agencies to cooperate to the fullest extent in aiding the commission and meeting the requests for assistance which may be made by it.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
