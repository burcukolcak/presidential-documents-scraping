Statement by the President Commending the "Crusade for Christian Citizenship."
I HEARTILY commend the Christian Endeavor Movement for its "Crusade for Christian Citizenship."
Indifference to civic responsibilities and duties is one of the major causes of crime and bad government and contributes to the spread of communism. You are rendering America and freedom-loving peoples of the world a tremendous service as you are alerting youth to their tasks and helping them to be good citizens.
I hope your crusade will encourage many young men and women to make public service their career. We need fine Christian youth in the running of this country.
With the rising tide of Godless materialism it is imperative that youth and older folks as well have a vital interest in spiritual values and have faith in God. Only in this way can we hope for real brotherhood and peace.
