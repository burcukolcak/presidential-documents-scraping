Harry S. Truman
February 23, 1948

Remarks at Government House, St. Croix, Virgin Islands.
Governor Hastie, Administrator Taylor, fellow citizens and friends:
I am very happy to be here today to have this opportunity to visit St. Croix and to see for myself what this part of our American family is doing to meet our common problems. I have heard a great deal about the beauty of this island, and I am glad to say that the enthusiasm of my friends is more than justified.
Here, I know, our American way of working together toward peace and prosperity will bring results we can all enjoy. Governor Hastie and the Federal agencies are working together both here and in Washington to improve the use of St. Croix's many assets, and to develop new ones.
The Virgin Islands Company is our greatest hope for the stabilization of the economy of St. Croix, and I sincerely hope the Congress is going to recharter it. The new era of air travel should mean much to the islands, particularly to St. Croix with its splendid airport possibilities. Vacationists and tourists will travel more and more to the Caribbean, and to our own American soil in the Virgin Islands.
We must all be ready with enterprise and courage to make the most of these new developments, and through them to reach the higher standard of living we all strive for.
I bring you greetings from your fellow Americans, who watch with constant interest your efforts to meet problems which are familiar to them, too.
Note: The President spoke at 12 noon in Christiansted. In his opening words he referred to William H. Hastie, Governor of the Virgin Islands, and Harry E. Taylor, Administrator of St. Croix.
