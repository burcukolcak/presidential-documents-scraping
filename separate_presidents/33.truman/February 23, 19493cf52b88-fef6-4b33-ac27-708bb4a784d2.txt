Remarks at a Savings Bond Drive Dinner.
Mr. Secretary of the Treasury and all these distinguished guests and volunteers:
It is a wonderful thing you are doing for the country. I can't tell you how very much it is appreciated by every member of the Government of the United States. You are doing something that is going to be not only for the welfare of the country so far as stabilization and things of that kind are concerned, but you are going to do a favor to the people you call on, and the people you engage to help us in this opportunity drive.
I came over here personally to thank you and express my own personal appreciation as President of the United States for what you are doing.
Keep up the good work. As long as people are interested in the welfare of the Government, as you are interested in it, I haven't any doubt as to its stability and its lasting power. I think we are good for a thousand years.
I appreciate the fact that all of you are exceedingly busy people. You are making a contribution of your time and your effort to the welfare of your Government, and that is what makes this country great. Whenever an emergency faces us of any sort, I don't care whether it's a bond sale, or a snow. storm, or a flood, we always find the people at hand, willing to do what is necessary to make this great Republic what it is, a company of good neighbors, who think only of the welfare of the country as a whole.
That is what you are doing. You are making a great contribution, just as great as you made in the wartime.
Again I want to thank you for it.
Note: The President spoke at 8:30 p.m. in the Sapphire Room at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. In his opening words he referred to John W. Snyder, Secretary of the Treasury.
