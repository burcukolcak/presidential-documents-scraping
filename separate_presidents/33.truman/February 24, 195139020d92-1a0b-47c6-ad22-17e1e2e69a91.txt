Remarks at the White House Photographers' Association Award Ceremonies
I AM most happy to again hand out these first prizes for these historic pictures.
You know I have, I guess, about as great a collection as anybody of pictures and cartoons, particularly the pictures that win these prizes, and it gives me a great deal of pleasure to again hand this cup to the winner.
Note: The President spoke at 8:35 p.m. at the Library of Congress in Washington, where he opened the Association's eighth annual exhibit.
