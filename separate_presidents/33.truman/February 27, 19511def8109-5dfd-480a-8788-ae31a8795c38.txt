Remarks to a Group From the 82d Airborne Division.
MR. SECRETARY, it is a pleasure to see all these fine young men from, I understand, every State and Territory in the Union. I have been interested in your organization for a long time. Back in 1943 or 1944, I made an inspection of Fort Bragg as chairman of the Senate committee who was looking after things. I went up with the airborne people and wanted to jump out, and I almost got arrested by the major general because he said he would be court-martialed if I jumped out, so I didn't get to jump. I still have that anticipation and I hope some day to do it.
It is a pleasure to me, as I said before, to see you young men who are so thoroughly and completely interested in the welfare of the Nation. I know you will go back and put in everything you have so that if it ever becomes necessary for us to face a complete emergency you will be ready to make your contribution just the same as the rest of us will have to make ours.
I hope you have an enjoyable visit here. I understand that your principal interest up here is to see how the Congress works. Now, if you can find that out--and I served 10 years with the Congress--you will be a great bunch of young men.
Note: The President spoke at 12:15 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. His opening words "Mr. Secretary" referred to Secretary of the Army Frank Pace, Jr. The group of 52 paratroopers was stationed at Fort Bragg, N.C.
