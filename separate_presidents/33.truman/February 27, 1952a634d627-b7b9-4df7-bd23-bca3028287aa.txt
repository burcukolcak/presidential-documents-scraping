Remarks Welcoming Secretaries Acheson and Snyder on Their Return from the NATO Conference in Lisbon.
IT IS a very great pleasure to me this morning to welcome the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury--and I have already welcomed the Secretary of Defense-from a most successful conference.
I think we have accomplished in the last few days in London, Paris, and Lisbon the things we have been working for for the last 3 or 4 years.
It is indeed a high privilege of mine to congratulate the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury on the job they have accomplished.
Note: The President spoke at 10:35 a.m. at the Washington National Airport, following which Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Secretary of the Treasury John Snyder responded briefly. The text of the Secretaries' remarks was also released.
The ninth session of the North Atlantic Council was held in Lisbon, Portugal, from February 20 to February 25, 1952. The representatives from the United States to the Council, in addition to Secretaries Acheson and Snyder, were Robert A. Lovett, Secretary of Defense, and W. Averell Harriman, Director for Mutual Security.
