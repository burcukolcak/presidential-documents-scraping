Letter to General Bradley Regarding the Establishment of a Department of Medicine and Surgery in the Veterans Administration.
Dear General Bradley:
I have today given my approval to H.R. 4717, an enactment to establish a Department of Medicine and Surgery in the Veterans' Administration.
I recognize the emergency situation which confronts the Veterans' Administration at the present time in the recruiting of physicians, dentists and nurses.
It is my desire that, in carrying out the provisions of this law, you develop a system of recruitment and placement which will grant priority to qualified veterans and which will also provide against any possibility of discrimination because of race or creed.
I hope that this legislation will enable you and your associates to move forward in your determination to provide the veterans of this country with a progressive up-to-date Department of Medicine and Surgery. Much progress has been made in this direction, and I shall watch with real interest the additional steps which will be taken by you under this new law.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[General Omar N. Bradley, Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, Veterans' Administration, Washington 25, D.C.]
Note: As enacted, H.R. 4717 is Public Law 293, 79th Congress (59 Stat. 675).
