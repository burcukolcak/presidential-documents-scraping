Statement by the President on the Victory Clothing Collection for Overseas Relief.
THIS WINTER more than 300 million war victims throughout the world are paying the cost of victory in poverty, disease, cold and hunger. In all the countries devastated by war, lack of clothing intensifies their hardships. Their need is immediate and desperate.
I therefore urge every American to heed the appeal of the Victory Clothing Collection for Overseas Relief. The spare garments contributed by Americans last spring has helped clothe twenty-five million men, women, and children in Europe, China and the Philippines, and has made possible the start of their rehabilitation this winter.
In sharing our comparative plenty with the less fortunate once again, we make the Victory Clothing Collection an expression of our gratitude to the Almighty for the victory won at so great a cost.
