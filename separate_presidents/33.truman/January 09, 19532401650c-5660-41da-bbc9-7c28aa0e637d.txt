Letter Accepting Resignation of Robert A. Lovett as Secretary of Defense.
[Released January 9, 1953. Dated January 8, 1953]
Dear Bob:
I have your letter and I accept your resignation as Secretary of Defense, effective at the end of the President's term of office, January 20, 1953, as you desire.
I do this with regret. Your services in positions of great responsibility have been as varied as they have been distinguished. You not only have given time and energy to your country; with it you have brought results. Your foresight and initiative earned your colleagues' respect; the effective teamwork ensuing has been the Nation's gain.
The splendid achievements of the Department of Defense in these last years must be attributed in large part to your vision and deep understanding of international as well as domestic affairs. Your contribution to the national security places me and every other American in your debt.
You have discharged your duties well and faithfully. As we both prepare to leave office, I thank you for your devotion and your wisdom and your skill. Your good wishes, I appreciate. You have mine always.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
