Statement by the President Following a White House Meeting To Avert a Steel Strike.
THE SECRETARY OF LABOR, Mr. Schwellenbach; Mr. John W. Snyder of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion; and Dr. John R. Steelman, Special Assistant to the President, have been in conference most of the afternoon with Mr. Benjamin F. Fairless, representing the United States Steel Corporation, and Mr. Philip Murray, representing the United Steel Workers.
Mr. Fairless made an offer on behalf of the steel corporation. Mr. Murray countered with an offer on behalf of the Union.
Mr. Fairless asked for more time to present the proposition to the steel companies, as he could not speak definitely for his own company or the other companies on the counter-proposal of Mr. Murray.
At the request of the President, Mr. Murray agreed to postpone the calling of the strike for one week, during which time collective bargaining will proceed under the auspices of the President.
It is my belief that an agreement will be reached.
