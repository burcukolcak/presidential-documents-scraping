Letter Accepting Resignation of Jesse M. Donaldson as Postmaster General.
Dear Jess:
I have your resignation as Postmaster General and I accede to your wishes, effective at the end of my term of office, January 20, 1953.

I have been fortunate to have you in my official family. Your mastery of every phase of operations in the postal service is outstanding in the history of the Department, and I appreciate the fine manner in which you have conducted the affairs of the postal establishment. Also I have valued your wisdom and guidance, confident that you would put first the best interests of the United States and the American people.
Because you are a man who would never compromise principle for expediency, you have earned the respect of your countrymen as Postmaster General. You gave all that was in you, unselfishly and loyally, to me and to the Government during my administration. As a career postal employee for more than forty-five years and as a public official, you have served your country faithfully and well.
I hope that you will have a little time for leisure that has been denied you by your busy life. Whatever you do and wherever you are, my good wishes are with you.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
