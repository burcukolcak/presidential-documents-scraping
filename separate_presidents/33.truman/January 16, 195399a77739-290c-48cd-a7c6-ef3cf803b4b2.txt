Letter Accepting Resignation of Dean Acheson as Secretary of State.
Dear Dean:
I have your letter of resignation, effective at the end of my term, January 20, 1953, and I accept it with warm thanks for a job well done. I am glad I've had you with me all the way.
You have been my good right hand. There is no need for me to go into detail about all that you have accomplished. Certainly no man is more responsible than you for pulling together the people of the free world, and strengthening their will and their determination to be strong and free.
I would place you among the very greatest of the Secretaries of State this country has had. Neither Jefferson nor Seward showed more cool courage and steadfast judgment.
Our association has been a grand experience, from start to finish. I hope Mrs. Acheson prevails on you to take a good long rest. You deserve it.
Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: Mr. Acheson served as Assistant Secretary of State from February 1, 1941, to August 16, 1945, as Under Secretary of State from August 27, 1945, to June 30, 1947, and as Secretary of State from January 21, 1949, to January 20, 1953. His letter of resignation, dated January 7, was released with the President's reply.
