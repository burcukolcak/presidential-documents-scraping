Letter Accepting Resignation of Maurice J. Tobin as Secretary of Labor.
[Released January 16, 1953. Dated January 15, 1953]
Dear Maurice :
I want to thank you both officially and personally for the good work you have done as a member of my Cabinet, as I accept your resignation effective at the end of my term of office, January 20, 1953.
As Secretary of Labor, you have been in the forefront of the successful effort to bring full employment to the workers of this country. You have been instrumental in mobilizing the Nation's manpower for the defense of the free world. I am proud of your courageous struggle to obtain decent legislation for the rights of labor to organize and bargain collectively.
During your service, American workers have achieved the highest standard of living in history. You have contributed in great degree to this accomplishment not only by fighting for progressive labor legislation, but also by your farsighted administration of labor laws.
Your knowledge of government and politics and your sympathy with the problems of working people have enabled you to make a great contribution to the Department of Labor, the Government and the entire country.
I appreciated the commendation in your letter and the blessings you ask for me, particularly. You have my best wishes for the future.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
