Letter to the President-Elect Transmitting Report of the President's Committee on Government Contract Compliance.
Dear General Eisenhower:
I am glad to transmit to you the report of the President's Committee on Government Contract Compliance, which was handed to me on January sixteenth. At my request this Committee investigated fully the procedures now being used to obtain compliance with the non-discrimination clause required in nearly all Government procurement contracts. The Committee report submits a total of twenty-two recommendations for improving compliance. Some of them require legislative action; others can be accomplished by the Executive Branch but would require the approval of the Chief Executive.
I feel the Committee has done a thorough job of investigation and I wish to call your attention to these suggestions, some of which, I am sure, would be helpful.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Dwight D. Eisenhower, The Statler Hotel, Washington, D.C.]
