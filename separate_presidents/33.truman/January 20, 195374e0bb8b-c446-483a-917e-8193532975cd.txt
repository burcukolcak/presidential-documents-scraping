Letter to the President, American Federation of Government Employees, on the 70th Anniversary of the Merit System.
[Released January 20, 1953. Dated January 19, 1953]
Dear Mr. Campbell:
I am happy to join with you in the recognition of the 70th Anniversary of the establishment of the Federal Civil Service merit system. I have great faith and confidence in our civil servants. During the almost eight years of my Administration I have found in them a loyal and reliable force, always ready to do the public's work with impartiality and diligence. The people of the United States have a very great asset in this force. It is my fervent hope as I leave the Office of the Presidency that recent reckless attacks which can destroy that great asset will subside and that we will continue to go forward in creating a skilled corps of men and women with a public point of view who are willing to devote their careers to the people's business.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN

[Mr. James A. Campbell, President, American Federation of Government Employees, 900 F Street NW., Washington 4, D.C.]
