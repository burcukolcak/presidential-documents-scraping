Letter to the Chairman and Members of the President's Steel Fact-Finding Board.
Dear Mr. Feinsinger:
I have received the letter dated January 1946 signed by yourself and the other Members of the Steel fact-finding Board, Associate Justice Roger I. McDonough and Associate Justice James M. Douglas, in which you review the activities of the Board to date, and request instructions as to your further procedure.
For the present, I suggest that you continue your study of governmental data, and that you remain available for further consultation.
Your sincere desire to assist in every way possible in securing an early termination of this dispute is highly appreciated.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Nathan P. Feinsinger, Chairman, Steel Fact-Finding Board, Department of Labor, Washington, D.C.]
