Special Message to the Congress Concerning Relief to Palestine Refugees.
To the Congress of the United States:
I commend to the favorable consideration of the Congress the enclosed letter from the Acting Secretary of State and the accompanying draft legislation to authorize an appropriation for a special contribution by the United States to the United Nations for the relief of Palestine refugees. In submitting this proposed legislation, I wish to invite attention to the provisions of the resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations emphasizing the critical situation of these refugees and urging all states members of the United Nations to make voluntary contributions as soon as possible to meet their needs.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
