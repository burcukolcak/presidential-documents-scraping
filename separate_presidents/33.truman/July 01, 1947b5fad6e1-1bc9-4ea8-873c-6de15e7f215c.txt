Statement by the President Upon Signing Resolution Authorizing Him To Accept Membership in the International Refugee Organization.
I HAVE just signed the joint resolution authorizing the President to accept membership in the International Refugee Organization. Pursuant to this authorization I have also signed, on behalf of the United States, the necessary instrument of acceptance, which will be deposited promptly with the Secretary General of the United Nations by our Representative, the Honorable Warren R. Austin.
This action constitutes an important step toward the creation of an operating specialized agency established by the United Nations. I am confident that, through the International Refugee Organization, we shall give the world new reason to believe that no problem is too difficult if the nations firmly resolve to cooperate in solving it.
I am happy to accept membership in the International Refugee Organization on behalf of the United States.
Note: As enacted, the joint resolution providing for membership and participation by the United States in the International Refugee Organization is public Law 146, 80th Congress (61 Stat. 214).
