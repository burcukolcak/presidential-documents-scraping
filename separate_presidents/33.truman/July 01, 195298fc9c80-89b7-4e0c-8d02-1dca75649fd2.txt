Rear Platform Remarks in Newport, Arkansas.
THIS HAPPENS to be the number one whistlestop of 1952.
There are going to be a lot more of them. You have the privilege of being number one.
I hope you will be able to hear the rebroadcast of my power program speech tomorrow at Bull Shoals Dam. And that is a good name, you know--Bull Shoals. It will set out the policy of the Government of the United States towards public power, and it will be a part of the Democratic platform of 1952.
I am exceedingly sorry that I won't be able to make the same sort of back platform speeches as I did in 1948. I will be working for somebody else in 1952.
But I am happy indeed to have your wonderful Governor here with me this afternoon, and your Congressman, and the Secretary of the Army, frank Pace, and my Congressman of North Arkansas--who really is a Congressman from Missouri. It is a pleasure indeed, and I am going to enjoy every minute of this trip, because I like this part of the country. I have been in every county in this part of the State of Arkansas, and every county in southern Missouri. And I used to know everybody in Missouri by his first name when I was running for the Senate, but it has grown up on me. It has been 16 years since I have done that.
I have another great citizen of Arkansas here, the Secretary of the Treasury, John W. Snyder. I have got the Secretary of the Senate with me--I call him the third Senator from Arkansas--Leslie Biffle.
Note: The President spoke at 8:50 p.m. In the course of his remarks he referred to Governor Sidney S. McMath, Representative Wilbur D. Mills, Secretary of the Army frank Pace, Jr., Representative James W. Trimble, Secretary of the Treasury John W. Snyder, and Secretary of the Senate Leslie Biffle, all of Arkansas.
