Memorandum Reducing the Workweek of Federal Employees to 44 Hours.
To the heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
The Federal Government has been maintaining a work schedule of a six-day, 48-hour week for both the departmental and field service. I believe that the time has now come when we should make a change in this schedule.
It is my desire, therefore, that, with the exception of the War Department, the Navy Department, the Treasury Department, the Veterans Administration, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Panama Canal, the head of each department and agency establish, effective July 1, a 44-hour workweek. In the case of the departments above named, it is my desire that they examine their various operations very carefully and, wherever possible, put into effect a 44-hour workweek.
If the head of any department or agency other than the War Department, the Navy Department, the Treasury Department, the Veterans Administration, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Panama Canal feels that it is still necessary for him to maintain a 48-hour workweek, contrary to the general policy above outlined, he should apply to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget for an exception to this policy.
It should be clearly understood that reductions in hours of work are not to constitute a basis for requests for additional funds or personnel.
