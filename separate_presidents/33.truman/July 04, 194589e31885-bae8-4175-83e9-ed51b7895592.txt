Statement by the President on the Death of John Curtin, Prime Minister of Australia.
IT IS with deep sorrow that I have learned of the death today of the Right Honorable John Curtin, Prime Minister of Australia, who has brought to the public service of his country not only great ability and integrity but also a deep sense of loyalty to the principles which have guided the United Nations through this war so victoriously ended in Europe and so successfully being waged in the Far East. The Government and people of the United States mourn with the people of Australia the passing of this great leader.
