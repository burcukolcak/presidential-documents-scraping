Statement by the President Commending the Work of the United National Clothing Collection.
THE 7,300 local committees of the United National Clothing Collection have rendered a service to world peace. By meeting and exceeding their goal of 150,000,000 pounds of clothing, the American people have accomplished the task assigned to them by Franklin D. Roosevelt in a cause that was close to his heart. It is good to know that the clothing is now on its way overseas to relieve the suffering of war victims in Europe and the Far East.
Note: The statement was made following the receipt of a report by Henry J. Kaiser, chairman of the United National Clothing Collection. For letter to Mr. Kaiser asking him to head the second United National Clothing Collection campaign, see Item 144.
