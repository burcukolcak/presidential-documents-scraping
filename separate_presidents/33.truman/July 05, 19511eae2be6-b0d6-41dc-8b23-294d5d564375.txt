Remarks Upon Presenting Congressional Medals of Honor to Capt. Raymond Harvey, Capt. Lewis L. Millett, M. Sgt. Stanley T. Adams, and Corp. Einar H. Ingman, USA.
IT IS a privilege to perform this ceremony. Due to conditions over which I have had no control, it has been my duty to award more Medals of Honor than all the rest of the Presidents put together.
It is a proud moment when we can hear citations read such as these you have just listened to. It is also a proud moment for me to hang the medals around the necks of these young men.
They are the backbone of the Government of the United States. Always, when the emergency calls for it, they come forward and deliver what is necessary to win.
That is the reason we will win the cold war. That is the reason we will maintain the peace in the world. That is the reason this Republic of ours will continue to endure--because we have innumerable young men just like these four, who stand out for the welfare of this country, always.
I have told them many a time that I would much rather have that Congressional Medal of Honor than to be President of the United States. I don't think very many of them believe me, but it is true.
I congratulate you young men again on a great job well done.
Note: The President spoke at 12:15 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. The citations, describing the actions in Korea for which the medals were awarded, are printed in the Congressional Record (vol. 97, p. 7696).
