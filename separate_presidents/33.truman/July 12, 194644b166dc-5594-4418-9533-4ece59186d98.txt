Statement by the President Upon Releasing Report on Famine Relief Food Shipments.
EVERY AMERICAN can take pride in the record of accomplishment in shipping food for relief as shown in the attached report which I have received from Secretary of Agriculture Clinton P. Anderson.
Only by cooperation and determined effort on the part of everyone has it been possible to make good on our promises-and, in the case of food grains, to exceed our commitments. The public generally, food producers and handlers, transportation companies, organizations, and government agencies--all have helped to make this impressive record possible.
Only by continued cooperation among all of us can we as a nation do our full share in the months to come to relieve the hunger that still exists in the world.
The importance of this effort in relieving human suffering and establishing world peace cannot be overestimated.
Note: In his report, Mr. Anderson noted that the United States had exported more than 16 1/2 million long tons of foodstuffs to war-devastated countries during the year which ended June 30.
The report, dated July 8, is printed in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 15, p. 119).
