Harry S. Truman
July 13, 1945

Statement by the President: Bastille Day
In Bastille Day the people of France have given the world an undying symbol of Freedom. Throughout the long history of our friendship with France the people of the United States have shared the principles for which it stands. Never have those principles had a greater significance than in this year of the final overthrow of one of the darkest tyrannies that has ever tried to enslave mankind.
