Remarks to W. Averell Harriman Before His Departure on a Mission to Iran.
THE PRESIDENT. I want to express to you my appreciation for your willingness to undertake this trip to Iran. It is a very important job that you have undertaken, and one which I think you can handle with satisfaction and success.
All of us want to wish you a pleasant trip, and I hope that you will express to the Iranian Government that our interest is the interest of world peace, and the welfare of Iran and the rest of the world.
We have no selfish interest in the matter whatever.
Note: The President spoke at 11:55 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. Brief remarks by Secretary of State Dean Acheson, Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall, and Mr. Harriman were also released.
