Letter to Secretary Morgenthau Concerning the Appointment of Fred M. Vinson as His Successor.
Dear Henry:
I have given careful consideration to your letter of July thirteenth urging that I send to the Senate immediately the nomination of Judge Vinson as Secretary of the Treasury.
I am inclined to agree with you that for the reasons you mention it would be preferable to take this action now instead of waiting for my return from Europe.
I appreciate very much the fine spirit and keen sense of public responsibility in which you have approached this matter.
With personal regards,

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Honorable Henry Morgenthau, Jr., The Secretary of the Treasury]
Note: Secretary Morgenthau's letter, also released, pointed out that such matters as the continuation of war financing, the tax enforcement drive, revenue legislation, and many other problems called for prompt decision; and that his successor should be given the opportunity to make the decisions since it would become his duty to carry them out. Secretary Morgenthau also referred to the possibility of a recess in the Senate, which would delay Judge Vinson's confirmation.
The letters were exchanged by wireless while the President was aboard the U.S.S. Augusta en route to the Potsdam conference.
