Recorded Message to the President and People of France on Bastille Day.
To the President and the People of France:
The French people are today celebrating their first peacetime Bastille Day since 1939.
Two years ago, we were fighting against the Germans on French soil, side by side with the valiant soldiers of France, both military and civilian.
One year ago, while the war was nearing its victorious conclusion in the Far East, France was rebuilding her economy and receiving again into her arms those of her brave sons and daughters who had returned from the infamous prisons and camps of Germany.
In spite of her losses and the destruction of her territory for the second time in 25 years, France remains in the front line of the free nations of the earth, proclaiming today the same principles of liberty and of respect for the individual as those in whose name her people spoke 157 years ago.
On this day--a day bright with the achievements of the great French Republic, and with the deeds, suffering, and sacrifice of her valiant people--I am happy to address to you, Mr. President, in the name of the United States of America, my best wishes and fraternal salutations.
