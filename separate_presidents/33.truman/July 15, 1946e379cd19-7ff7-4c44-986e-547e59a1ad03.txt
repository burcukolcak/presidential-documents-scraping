Remarks Upon Presenting a Citation to a Nisei Regiment.
IT IS a very great pleasure to me today to be able to put the seventh regimental citation on your banners.
You are to be congratulated on what you have done for this great country of ours. I think it was my predecessor who said that Americanism is not a matter of race or creed, it is a matter of the heart.
You fought for the free nations of the world along with the rest of us. I congratulate you on that, and I can't tell you how very much I appreciate the privilege of being able to show you just how much the United States of America thinks of what you have done.
You are now on your way home. You fought not only the enemy, but you fought prejudice--and you have won. Keep up that fight, and we will continue to win--to make this great Republic stand for just what the Constitution says it stands for: the welfare of all the people all the time.

Bring forward the colors.
Note: The President reviewed the 442d Regimental Combat Team and made the presentation in a ceremony on the Ellipse south of the White House grounds at 2:45 p.m.
