Proclamation 2797â€”Death of General Pershing

To the People of the United States:
It becomes my sad duty to announce officially the death of John J. Pershing, General of the Armies of the United States, who died at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C., at 3:50 a.m. on the 15th day of July, 1948.
General Pershing devoted his entire life to his profession. He served with distinction in numerous campaigns and his glorious part in the first World War will never be forgotten. His death comes as a great sorrow to his friends and as a genuine bereavement to the people of the United States. He has already achieved an honored place in our history.
As a mark of respect to General Pershing's memory it is hereby ordered that the national flag be displayed at half-mast upon all public buildings and at all forts and military posts and naval stations, and on all vessels of the United States, until after the funeral shall have taken place.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Doneat the City of Washington this 15th day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third.
