Statement by the President on the Manpower Needs of the Western Railroads.
IF THE DEMANDS of the Japanese war are to be met, the railroads in the west must have additional manpower immediately. The manpower shortage is so serious that the War Department recently ordered 4,000 experienced railroad men to be furloughed from the Army to help ease the situation, but they are only a fraction of the number needed.
The western railroads today need 65,000 men and need them badly. We must keep men and materiel flowing into the ports as fast as our convoys can transport them to the battle zone.
The effects of the shortage already are being felt, with the peak load still months away. Our soldiers returning from the European Campaign are not getting the best accommodations because many cars are in the shops awaiting repairs and overhauling. Some troops are being delayed at the ports because trains cannot be supplied promptly. Overworked crews must be given time to rest before taking trains out on long, hard trips. Trains are often late because of short switching crews which cannot keep traffic moving at top efficiency. Unless additional manpower is found those delays will become serious as the load increases.
That is why I am bringing this situation to the attention of the American people. Any patriotic American who is not already engaged in essential war work can make a real contribution toward the defeat of Japan by applying for a job on a western railroad during this emergency period. Those who are now working on railroads can do a great service to their country by remaining on the job.
Note: The statement was released at No. 2 Kaiserstrasse in Babelsberg, Germany, which served as headquarters for the President and his staff during the Potsdam conference. The President arrived at Babelsberg on July 15.
