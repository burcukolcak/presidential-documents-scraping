WHEREAS the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (hereinafter referred to as the trust territory) has been placed under the trusteeship system established in the Charter of the United Nations by means of a trusteeship agreement (hereinafter referred to as the agreement), approved by the Security Council of the United Nations on April 2, 1947, and by the United States Government on July 18, 1947, after due constitutional process; and
WHEREAS the United States of America, under the terms of the agreement, is designated as the administering authority of the trust territory and has assumed obligations for the government thereof; and
WHEREAS it is necessary to establish an interim administration of the trust territory, pending the enactment of appropriate legislation by the Congress of the United States providing for the future government thereof:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
1. The military government in the former Japanese Mandated Islands is hereby terminated, and the authority and responsibility for the civil administration of the trust territory, on an interim basis, is hereby delegated to the Secretary of the Navy.
2. The Secretary of the Navy shall, subject to such policies as the President may from time to time prescribe, and, when appropriate, in collaboration with other departments or agencies of the Federal Government, carry out the obligations which the United States, as the administering authority of the trust territory, has assumed under the terms of the agreement and the Charter of the United Nations: Provided, however, that the authority granted to the United States under Article 13 of the agreement to close any areas for security reasons and to determine the extent to which Articles 87 and 88 of the Charter of the United Nations shall be applicable to such closed areas shall be exercised jointly by the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of State: And Provided further, that all relations between departments or agencies of the Federal Government and appropriate organs of the United Nations with respect to the trust territory shall be conducted through the Secretary of State.
3. This order, subject to subsequent modification, shall be effective as of this date and shall remain effective until a designation is made of the civilian department or agency which is to have permanent responsibility for the government of the trust territory.
