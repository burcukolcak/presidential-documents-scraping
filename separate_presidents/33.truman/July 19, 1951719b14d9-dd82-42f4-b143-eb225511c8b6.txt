Remarks to a Group of Danish Boys From the International Boys Camp, Inc.
IT IS a pleasure to have you here. I hope you are all enjoying yourselves at the camp. I am sure you are, because by the looks of you, you are getting plenty to eat.
I hope that when you go back home you will carry with you an impression of this country that will be lasting, and that will be pleasant.
It is a pleasure for me to greet you this morning, and in the name of your country; and I hope that you will continue to have a pleasant time while you are here, and when you go back home you will all be successful in your own countries.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 12:10 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. In addition to the high school boys attending the camp, the group included Danish Ambassador Henrik de Kauffmann and Mrs. Ruth Bryan Rohde, who had founded the camp with her late husband, Borge Rohde. Mrs. Rohde, daughter of William Jennings Bryan, had formerly been a Congresswoman and U.S. Minister to Denmark.
