Harry S. Truman
July 20, 1945

Remarks at the Raising of the Flag Over the U.S. Group Control Council Headquarters in Berlin.
General Eisenhower, officers and men:
This is an historic occasion. We have conclusively proven that a free people can successfully look after the affairs of the world.
We are here today to raise the flag of victory over the capital of our greatest adversary. In doing that, we must remember that in raising that flag we are raising it in the name of the people of the United States, who are looking forward to a better world, a peaceful world, a world in which all the people will have an opportunity to enjoy the good things of life, and not just a few at the top.
Let us not forget that we are fighting for peace, and for the welfare of mankind. We are not fighting for conquest. There is not one piece of territory, or one thing of a monetary nature that we want out of this war. We want peace and prosperity for the world as a whole. We want to see the time come when we can do the things in peace that we have been able to do in war.
If we can put this tremendous machine of ours, which has made this victory possible, to work for peace we can look forward to the greatest age in the history of mankind. That is what we propose to do.
Note: The President spoke shortly before 4 p.m. in the courtyard at the headquarters buildings. The flag used was the same one that had flown over the Capitol in Washington when war was declared against Germany.
