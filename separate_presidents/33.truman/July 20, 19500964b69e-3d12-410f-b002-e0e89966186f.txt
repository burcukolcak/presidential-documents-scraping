Statement by the President on the Appointment of Charles M. Spofford as Deputy U.S. Representative to the North Atlantic Council.
MR. Charles M. Spofford, whom I have appointed Deputy U.S. Representative, North Atlantic Council, will leave for London shortly to assume his duties. The Secretary of State and I have discussed with him the nature of the tasks which lie ahead of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
The North Atlantic Council, in its meeting during May, stressed the urgency of building the defenses of the North Atlantic area. As I indicated in my message to the Congress on Wednesday, we cannot safely ignore the possibility of aggression in other parts of the world besides the Far East, and it is even more urgent now than it was in May to strengthen the collective defense of the North Atlantic area.
Through the Council of Deputies, which will convene in London next week and on which Mr. Spofford will represent the United States, our Government will be in continuous contact with the other North Atlantic Treaty nations in a common effort to speed the measures necessary for our collective security. Mr. Spofford's job is vitally important in this common effort, and I wish him success as he leaves to assume his responsibilities.
I am pleased to announce that Mr. John Sherman Cooper will accompany Mr. Spofford to the initial meetings of the deputies as a special adviser.
