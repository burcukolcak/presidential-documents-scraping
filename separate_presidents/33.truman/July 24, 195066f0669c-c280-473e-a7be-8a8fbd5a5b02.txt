Statement by the President on Reporting Information Relating to Espionage, Sabotage, and Subversive Activities.
ON September 6, 1939, and January 8, 1943, a presidential directive was issued providing that the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice should take charge of investigative work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage, subversive activities, and related matters. It was pointed out that the investigations must be conducted in a comprehensive manner on a national basis and all information carefully sifted out and correlated in order to avoid confusion. I should like to again call the attention of all enforcement officers, both Federal and State, to the request that they report all information in the above enumerated fields promptly to the nearest field representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is charged with the responsibility of correlating this material and referring matters which are under the jurisdiction of any other Federal agency with responsibilities in this field to the appropriate agency.
I suggest that all patriotic organizations and individuals likewise report all such information relating to espionage, sabotage, and subversive activities to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this same manner.
Note: The directive of September 6, 1939, is printed in "The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt," edited by Judge Samuel I. Rosenman (1939 vol., p. 478).
