Statement by the President on the Continued Need for Food.
IN THIS FOURTH YEAR of war the need for every ounce of food which the American people can produce and preserve is greater than ever before.
The supply lines to feed our troops and the millions fighting and working with them are the longest in the history of warfare. Along the thousands of miles of these lines, food must be kept moving. Our soldiers in Europe are eating more canned fruits and vegetables because they are changing from combat rations to regular meals.
Beyond our tremendous military requirements lies the task of working with other nations to help liberated peoples regain their strength and rebuild their countries. There can be no lasting peace in a hungry world.
We Americans must do our part to help swell the nation's food supply.
I call upon every American to help discharge this obligation in every way possible:
By growing a victory garden--whether it be in the backyard, in a community or company employe plot, or on the farm. There is still plenty of time to plant in most parts of the country.
By dedicating ourselves to growing larger and better gardens and seeing them through to the harvest.
By preserving our food at home or in a community canning center. Civilian supplies of commercially canned fruits and vegetables are now at the lowest point of the war, and next winter will be one-fourth less than last year.
By conserving food in every possible way--wasting not an ounce. In anything so hazardous and difficult as growing food, we cannot afford to take chances. We must always reckon with the weather, which in some parts of the country delayed plantings and damaged some fruit crops. We must plan for maximum production.
With millions of American men and women dedicated to this task, our food will make a real contribution to the final victory and the peace.
