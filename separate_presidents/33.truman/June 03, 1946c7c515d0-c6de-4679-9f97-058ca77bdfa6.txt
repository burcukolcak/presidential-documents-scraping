Letter Accepting Resignation of Edward R. Stettinius as U.S. Representative to the United Nations.
Dear Ed:
When I received your letter of resignation a few days ago I stated that I did not want to accept it and hoped that I might persuade you to remain in office.
This morning when you reminded me of my statement that I would relieve you after the United Nations organization was established and functioning I still hoped that I might induce you to withdraw your resignation. Only because of your earnest insistence have I decided to comply with your request and accept your resignation.
In doing so I wish to express to you my sincere appreciation of your cooperation and of your splendid service. As Under Secretary and later as Secretary of State you made a valuable contribution to the United Nations, serving at Dumbarton Oaks and San Francisco. In the Security Council you have represented our Government in a manner reflecting credit upon yourself and upon the United States.
I accept without question the statements in your letter as to the reasons for your wishing to resign at this time and wish you good fortune in whatever you may determine to do.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Honorable Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., Washington, D.C.]
Note: Mr. Stettinius served as U.S. Representative to the United Nations from December 21, 1945, to June 3, 1946. His letter of resignation, dated May 23, was released with the President's reply.
