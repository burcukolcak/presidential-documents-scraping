Remarks Upon Receiving a Plaque Presented by the Capital Press Club.
I APPRECIATE this presentation very much. It is certainly kind and thoughtful of your Press Club to remember me in this way.
I shall always treasure it, and I hope that I can live up to the sentiments expressed in the sentence which is on the plaque.
I am highly appreciative, and thank you very much.
Note: The plaque was presented to the President at 12:35 p.m. in a ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House.
The following inscription appears on the plaque: "In tribute to the Hon. Harry S. Truman, President of the United States, who has unequivocably and with valor utilized his Presidential powers of informing the people and molding public opinion to insist that the Nation believe in and live by the Christian ideal of brotherhood and the constitutional principle of human equality.
