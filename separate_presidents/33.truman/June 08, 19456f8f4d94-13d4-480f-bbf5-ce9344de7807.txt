Citation Accompanying the Distinguished Service Medal Honoring General Edwin M. Watson.
MAJOR GENERAL Edwin M. Watson, United States Army, served as Military Aide to the President for a period of nearly twelve years, from 1 June 1933 to 20 February 1945, the last six years of which he also served as Secretary to the President. During this time momentous decisions were required on the most critical problems that have ever confronted the Nation. While General Watson filled the post of Military Aide to the President, the greatest peacetime Army in history was organized; the country was thrown into war on a world-wide scale and was well on the road to victory at the time of General Watson's death.
General Watson's broad and thorough knowledge and his genial manner enabled him as Military Aide to be of the greatest assistance to the Commander-in-Chief. His familiarity with the problems pertaining to the Army enabled him to enhance greatly the confidence reposed in the Nation's military leaders by the President and other high officials in the Government. His devotion to duty and unfailing loyalty to the Commander-in-Chief and the Army kept General Watson at his post despite failing health and against medical advice. He served as Military Aide to the President with distinction, thereby contributing in no small part to the successful prosecution of the war.
Note: The presentation was made by the president to Mrs. Watson in a ceremony at the White House. General Watson died February 28, 1945, while returning from the Crimea Conference.
