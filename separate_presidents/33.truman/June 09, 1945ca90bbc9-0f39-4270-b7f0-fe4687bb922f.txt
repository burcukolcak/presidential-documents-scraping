Statement by the President on Paper Conservation.
BEFORE WE WERE forced to fight this war we took for granted our abundance in a land of plenty. Early in the conflict, however, we learned the importance of conservation and salvage of critical materials. Paper in its varied forms is essential to the business of supplying, feeding and clothing our armed forces. As our fighting might expanded the need for more paper grew. Accordingly, we took steps to insure a constant supply. We saved paper. We learned to think twice before we destroyed paper--and other things--which could be used again.
I hope that every community will cooperate fully with all salvage committees who are doing their part in saving waste paper, particularly the boys and girls who are rendering such a patriotic service in collecting the paper. They deserve all of the help we can give them as well as our warm gratitude.
