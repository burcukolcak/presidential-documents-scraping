Memorandum Transmitting an Exchange of Correspondence Between the President and Senator Russell Regarding the Communist Prisoners Interned on Koje Island.
Memorandum for: Secretary of Defense
Attached is copy of a letter from Senator Russell, which I think has a lot of merit.
It seems to me that it would be well to ask Sweden, Switzerland, India, Pakistan and Indonesia to send military men to Korea to take a look at the situation and see what really is happening. Senator Russell's letter is self explanatory.
