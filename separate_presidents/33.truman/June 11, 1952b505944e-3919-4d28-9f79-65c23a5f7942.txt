Remarks to Members of the United States Attorneys Association.
THANK YOU, Mr. Attorney General. I know very well that the people here do actually represent the welfare of the United States as a whole.
Now I have been in elective public office for 30 years. I have been in politics for 40 or 45 years, and I understand the political approach to most of these things that are being done and have been done.
But when it comes right down to the basis of the Government, it is entirely safe in your hands, Mr. Attorney General, and in the hands of these good people here.

As I said to you once before, your objective is to enforce the law, but in enforcing the law you must see that the individual has justice, and receives the proper treatment under the Bill of Rights. In my opinion, the Bill of Rights is the greatest part of the Constitution, and when we do not enforce the Bill of Rights--and I am sorry to say that there are some committees in the Congress that don't know there is a Bill of Rights in the Constitution--we are doing the country a disservice.
We don't want anybody to get away with criminal action. We don't want any crooks left out of jail when they do crooked things, but neither do we want to be in the position of character assassins for the purpose of publicity--and I fear very much that is one of the things that has been going on here lately in our public service.
I am counting on you not only to enforce the law, but to see that the Bill of Rights is lived up to, in spirit as well as to the letter. Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 3:20 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. In his opening words he referred to Attorney General James P. McGranery.
