Harry S. Truman

Remarks to Delegates to the National Conference of Boy Governors.
I DON'T think I am in any position to give you advice on governorships, because I never was a Governor. I have had two or three other jobs in the public interest that have been of some responsibility. This one particularly that I have now, which is an enlarged governorship, only you have 48 States and a lot of territories, and sometimes the whole world to look after from this desk.
But you are doing the right thing in becoming familiar with the operations of the greatest government in the history of the world. It is a government that starts from the bottom and goes to the top, instead of starting at the top and going to the bottom. That is the reason it has been successful on this American continent.
If you remember, we started out with 13 Colonies and about 3 million people. Now we have 48 States and 148 million people, and a worldwide interest in the peace of the whole world. We have grown from the newest and smallest nation in the world to the greatest nation in the history of the world.
And it is young men like you who can continue the responsibilities that are necessary to carry on a government like that. In a few years the responsibility is going to be in your hands. Most of us who are now responsible for the operation of the Government will be out of business and unheard of 10 years from now, when you will be just coming to the point where you can really do the country some good.
I appreciate very much your interest in this Government of yours. It is a pleasure to me to have you here and discuss the situation with you.
Note: The President spoke at 12:30 p.m. in his office at the White House.
