Harry S. Truman
June 17, 1952

Remarks Upon Receiving a Medal Presented by Students from William Chrisman High School, independence, Missouri.
WELL, I appreciate that most highly. I don't know of any other place I would rather receive it from than from Independence High School--William Chrisman High School it is now--from which I graduated in 1901, a long time ago.
I shall treasure this and put it with my mementoes. If ever I get in a contest on oratory, I shall wear it.
I hope you are successful in your continuation of your contest, and that I may have the privilege of shaking hands with one of you as a national winner.
I hope, when you go back to my hometown, you will remember me to my friends out there, and I shall always consider Independence and Jackson County my home. And sometime after the 20th of January next, I expect to be back.
Note: The President spoke at 11:35 a.m. at the White House.
David freeman, president of the student body and one of four first place winners from the high school in the speech contests in Missouri, presented President Truman with a gold medal on behalf of the school's chapter of the National forensic League. The award carried with it a life membership in the League. The other three winners of the speech contests were Delores Tandy, Celia Fry, and Douglas Hagan. They were accompanied to the White House by Gregory Lefever, assistant principal, and .Margaret Meredith, speech instructor.
The students were en route to Boston to compete in the national tournament, to be held at Boston University, June 23-29.
