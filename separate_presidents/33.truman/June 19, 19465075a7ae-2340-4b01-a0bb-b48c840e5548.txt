Letter Accepting Resignation of Harold D. Smith as Director of the Bureau of the Budget.
Dear Harold:
With very deep regret I accept your resignation as Director of the Bureau of the Budget, effective at the close of business today.
My regret, in thus complying with your request for immediate release from your present duties, is tempered by the consideration that you are to assume duties of highest importance as Vice President of the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development.
There is a great work before you in the international field. It is the solemn duty of all members of the United Nations to render wholehearted and loyal support to that great pioneering adventure in restoring order to a chaotic world--the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development. The experience which you will bring to this new work and the constructive service which you will perform justify the sacrifices which your own Government is making in releasing you.
Yours has been a distinguished career through seven momentous years as head of the Budget. The problems which these troubled years presented were many, diverse and complex. You had the vision to see the national picture as a whole. You had full knowledge of our financial resources. You knew when to be firm in the face of exorbitant demands on the national treasury. Besides great ability, you brought to the work fidelity, integrity and loyalty.
I know, too, at what great financial sacrifice you have served your Government. That is too often a tragedy of public service. I can only say: well done, and tender you the thanks of the Nation which you have served with such unselfish devotion.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: Mr. Smith served as Director of the Bureau of the Budget from April 15, 1939, to June 19, 1946. His letter of resignation, dated June 19, was released with the President's reply.
