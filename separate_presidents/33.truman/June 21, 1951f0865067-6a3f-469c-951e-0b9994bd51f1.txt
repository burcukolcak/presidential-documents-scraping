Remarks to a Group of Newsboy Bond Salesmen.
THE SECRETARY of the Treasury tells me that you have been very cooperative and very helpful in selling bonds. I want to thank you for it.
You are doing something that is good for your country, something that is good for yourselves, and something that is good for those to whom you succeed in selling bonds, for bonds are a favor to them.
I hope you will continue to cooperate with the Secretary of the Treasury in this effort of ours to keep down inflation.
No man is in a bad fix when his savings are invested in Government bonds. It is the safest investment in the world, and always has been.
I want to thank you very much. I am sorry that the weather had to give you a sweat bath out here in our Rose Garden today, but since we have been fenced in, we don't get much breeze up here. I don't see that it is going to hurt any of you very much, though, because I imagine you get up a sweat every day in your business.

Thank you all very much.
Note: The President spoke at 3:05 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. In his opening words he referred to Secretary of the Treasury John W. Snyder.
The boys represented newsboys throughout the country who distributed savings bond pledge cards to their customers during the month of May.
The group was attending the National Carrier Congress then meeting in Washington.
