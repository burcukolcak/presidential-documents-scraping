Remarks Upon Presenting the Young American Medal for Bravery and the Young American Medal for Service.
IT IS a great pleasure to perform this service.
As you know, one of the most pleasant things I do in this Rose Garden is to award medals for bravery and service.
These medals are for bravery and service in the highest degree, and I take great pleasure as President of the United States in presenting them to these young people.
Note: The President spoke at 12:10 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House.
The selection of the young people to receive the medals was made under an act of Congress (64 Stat. 397) authorizing the Department of Justice to recognize and to award to outstanding courageous young Americans a medal for heroism known as the Young American Medal for Bravery and a medal for service and character known as the Young American Medal for Service.
Recipients of the medal for bravery were Margaret Galassi, aged 16, of Springfield, Ill., and Parker Edward Strait, aged 10, of Coral Gables, Fla. Miss Galassi had rescued seven children with whom she was babysitting from their burning home, returning twice to the building in order to bring the remaining two out of danger. Parker Edward Stratt had risked his life to pull a 9-year-old girl from the jaws of an alligator.
The service medal was presented to Stuart William Oberg, aged 17, of Millinocket, Maine, in recognition of his participation in various public activities. His record of service toward his school, his town, and his country had resulted in his being elected as one of three Hi-Y delegates from the Nation to attend UNESCO.
