Exchange of Messages With Governor Dewey Concerning U.S. Action in Korea.
I AM grateful for your message and hasten to assure you that I shall find strength and courage in your brave words. The wholehearted pledge of support which you give will be a source of inspiration and fortitude as we gird ourselves for the difficult tasks ahead. We have taken our stand on the side of Korea and our pledge of faith to that nation is a witness to all the world that we champion liberty wherever the tyranny of communism is the aggressor.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Thomas E. Dewey, Governor of New York, Albany, New York]
Note: The text of Governor Dewey's telegram to the President, dated June 27, follows: The President The White House
I whole-heartedly agree with and support the difficult decision you have made today to extend American assistance to the Republic of Korea in combatting armed communist aggression. Your action there, in Formosa, the Philippines, and in Indochina was necessary to the security of our country and the free world. It should be supported by a united America.
THOMAS E. DEWEY
