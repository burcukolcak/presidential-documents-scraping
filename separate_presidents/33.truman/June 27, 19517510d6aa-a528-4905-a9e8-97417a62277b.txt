Harry S. Truman
June 27, 1951

Remarks to Members of the Student Citizenship Seminar.
IT IS a pleasure to have you. I understand you are in Washington studying the Government and its operation. I hope you will find out all about it. I have been trying to find out all about it for 60 years--and I still have a lot to learn.
It is an interesting thing, though, to have the young people of the country interested enough in the Government to come here and give it the once-over, trying to get the information that will be helpful in the next generation, when you have to take over the reins of the Government.
Find out how it is operated, and be in a position to operate it when the time comes for you to do it--and the time will come, and will come all too suddenly. It will be upon you before you know it.
But I am more than happy that you are interested in the Government of the United States. You also want to become interested in your local government, and city government, and county government, and State government. They all hook in together. They all have a bearing on your welfare and your future. You ought to know just as much about all of those branches of government as you possibly can learn.
I hope you have had a successful tour here, and that you will continue to have a good time. I won't keep you standing in this sun any longer.
Note: The President spoke at 12:55 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. The Student Citizenship Seminar, held under the auspices of the YMCA and YWCA, was attended by more than 100 students from colleges and universities all over the country.
