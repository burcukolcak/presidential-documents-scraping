Letter Commending the Federal Communications Commission.
[Released June 28, 1946. Dated June 17, 1946 ]
My dear Mr. Denny:
The Director of the Budget has called to my attention the noteworthy steps being taken by the Federal Communications Commission in order to cope with its greatly increased workload. The Commission is to be commended for its decision to scrutinize its procedures in an effort to give the public the best service, without delay and at a minimum cost. Only by each of us concentrating upon performing our part of the task most efficiently can the goal of maximum efficiency and minimum cost be attained for the whole Federal Government.
I congratulate the Commissioners and the employees upon the accomplishments made thus far, and I wish the Commission every success in carrying out its program.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Mr. Charles R. Denny, Acting Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C.]
