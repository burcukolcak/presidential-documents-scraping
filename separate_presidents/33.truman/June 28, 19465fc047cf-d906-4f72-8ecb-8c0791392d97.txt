Letter to the President, Civil Service Commission, Concerning Employees of Liquidated Agencies.
[Released June 28, 1946. Dated June 27, 1946]
Dear Mr. Mitchell:
I have today signed an executive order terminating effective June 30, 1946, the Director of Liquidation established pursuant to Executive Order No. 9674 of January 4, 1946.
I am hopeful that during the next fiscal year the problems now facing us will be resolved and that many of the emergency war agencies can be liquidated.
As these agencies are terminated, many thousands of employees will be released. Among these employees are some of the most capable people in the Federal service. It is my desire that the Civil Service Commission and the Liaison Officer for Personnel Management continue their efforts to retain in the Federal service as many of these people as possible by assisting them to secure employment in other Federal agencies.
Also, I desire you to continue your efforts designed to ameliorate the impact of liquidation upon the employees of liquidating or reducing agencies.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Harry B. Mitchell, President, U.S. Civil Service Commission, Washington 25, D.C.]
