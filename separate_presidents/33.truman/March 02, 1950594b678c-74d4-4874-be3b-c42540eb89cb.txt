Remarks to a Group From the Ninth Annual Science Talent Search.
WELL, it is a pleasure to have you here, and I appreciate Mr. Davis bringing you in. You have a career before you that is absolutely essential to the welfare of this great Nation of ours.
The development of brains is much more important and much more necessary than the development of brawn, although we need both. We must have a good healthy body if we are going to have a good healthy mind. I believe in that sincerely.
I am glad that you are prizewinners, and I hope you will continue your studies, as Mr. Davis says, to be of some practical use to this great country with scientific developments for peace and for the welfare of the world. That is what we are working for most.
Note: The President spoke at 12:05 p.m. in his office at the White House. In his opening words he referred to Watson Davis, Director of Science Service, who conducted the talent search for Westinghouse Electric Corporation.
The group was composed of 40 young men and women from 15 States. All were winners of Westinghouse Science Scholarships awarded by the Corporation.
