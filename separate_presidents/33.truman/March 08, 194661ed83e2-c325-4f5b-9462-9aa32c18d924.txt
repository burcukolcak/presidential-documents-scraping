CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD Of THE MEDAL FOR MERIT

TO

JOHN MONROE JOHNSON
JOHN MONROE JOHNSON, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the United States as Director of the Office of Defense Transportation. His broad experience and understanding of transportation problems were of inestimable value to both the armed forces of the Nation and its transportation agencies, when transportation was more vital to the war effort than in any previous war. The soundness of his concept of the problem and his policies were of immeasurable assistance to the Nation in satisfactorily handling the movements of personnel and materials, in numbers and volume without parallel in history. His ability, his industry and his untiring devotion to duty were of incalculable benefit to the war effort of the Nation.
