Remarks at the First Meeting of the National Capital Sesquicentennial Commission.
THE ARRIVAL of the city of Washington at the venerable age of 150 years in 1950 will be a matter of importance to all the citizens of the United States, and a symbol to freedom-loving people everywhere. I am happy to serve with the distinguished members of this Commission in planning a celebration of this anniversary in keeping with the high importance of the occasion.
The Capital of the United States belongs to all the citizens of the United States--as much to the men and women of Maine or California, Minnesota or Georgia, as to any of us here. The sesquicentennial of the city of Washington should be celebrated not just within the confines of the District of Columbia, but all over the Nation.
In a larger sense, we hope that all friends of democracy everywhere will join with us in marking the birthday of a city which has grown great as the capital of our democratic Nation.
Note: The President served as ex officio chairman of the Commission which was established by an act of Congress on July 18, 1947 (61 Stat. 396). The other members of the Commission included the President pro tempore of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, three Senators appointed by the President pro tempore, three Representatives appointed by the Speaker, and six residents of the District of Columbia appointed by the President.
