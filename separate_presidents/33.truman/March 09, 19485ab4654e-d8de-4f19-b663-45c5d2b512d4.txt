Letter to Lincoln MacVeagh on His Appointment as Ambassador to Portugal,
My dear Mr. MacVeagh:
On the occasion of your appointment as Ambassador to Portugal, I would like to make some personal expression of appreciation for the high services you have already rendered your country.
During the past fifteen critical years you have served with distinction as Chief of the United States Missions to Iceland, the Union of South Africa, Yugoslavia, and Greece. In this last post especially--as Minister from 1933 to 1941 and as Ambassador since 1943 your scholarly statesmanship and diplomatic judgment have been of the utmost value.
Your broad and farsighted understanding of international developments with respect to Greece helped crystallize American determination to uphold the vital principles at stake in the present Greek situation. Through your knowledge of Greece, and by the exercise of tact, patience and geniality, you were able to adjust many practical difficulties and assure ever closer friendship and cooperation between the Greek and American peoples, thereby laying an indispensable groundwork for our common efforts to preserve Greek independence.
Your assignment to Greece has been an exceptionally long and trying one. It involved the most arduous duties as well as physical hardship and danger, and was saddened towards the end by the loss of your wife who was a devoted partner in all of your activities.
In thanking you for a job well done under these most difficult circumstances, I extend also my very best wishes in connection with the important new responsibilities you are about to assume.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Lincoln MacVeagh, Department of State, Washington, D.C. ]
