Telegram to Leading Citizens Requesting Them To Serve on a National Famine Emergency Council.
AT SUGGESTION of Famine Emergency Committee I am asking you as citizen and leader in a field concerned with food relief crisis to serve as member of National Famine Emergency Council. Council members will be asked to take the lead in their organizations or areas in promoting understanding of the facts about the danger of starvation of people in the war zones abroad and about the necessity to conserve food at home to meet those needs. General meeting of the Council is not to be called but you will be asked to serve in your community and organization to further objectives of emergency food program, and to submit your suggestions and recommendations. Please wire me promptly of your acceptance. Letter from Chester C. Davis, Chairman of Committee, will follow.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: The telegram was sent to a list of 124 citizens. The White House release also announced the appointment of an executive committee of the President's Famine Emergency Committee (see Items 45 and 49) consisting of Chester C. Davis, Eugene Meyer, James W. Young, Anna Lord Strauss, and George H. Gallup.
