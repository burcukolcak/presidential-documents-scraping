Letter to Owen D. Young Approving the Cancellation of the Congressional Awards Dinner.
[ Released March 14, 1946. Dated March 13, 1946 ]
Dear Mr. Young:
I have received your letter of March eighth and am deeply impressed by the common sense and spirit of practical service which prompt your suggestion. I heartily concur in your proposal as Chairman of Collier's Congressional Awards Committee that the dinner scheduled for April sixth be cancelled.
There is real merit in the further suggestion that the sum of five thousand dollars which might have been spent on the dinner, be given for the relief of hungry people.
In taking this step you are setting an excellent example to Washington and to the country as a whole. Many thoughtful persons in the Nation's Capital have commented unfavorably upon the inconsistency of serving unnecessary mass dinners and thereby consuming precious food supplies which otherwise could be conserved for starving persons all over the world. The country is recognizing our moral obligation to tighten our belts that we may share our abundance with the less privileged. It is our duty, particularly here in Washington, to practice what we preach.
I therefore welcome the opportunity to suggest that the five thousand dollars which would have gone for the dinner be turned over to the American National Red Cross and be earmarked for the relief of hunger.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Owen D. Young, Chairman, Collier's Congressional Awards Committee, Washington, D.C.]
Note: Mr. Young's letter was released with the President's reply. The White House release of which the letters were a part stated that the Collier's awards would be made on April 11 at the White House (see Item 80).
