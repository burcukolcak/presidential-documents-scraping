Harry S. Truman
March 18, 1949

Remarks at the Graduation Ceremonies, Fleet Sonar School, U.S. Naval Base, Key West, Florida.
IT IS a very great pleasure for me today to present these diplomas to these young men who have spent some time becoming experts in their lines. They are getting an education that will be of untold value to the country in case of emergency.
The Navy now not only has the surface of the sea to look after, but the air over it, and the water beneath. These young men have been making studies in their special line of work that will be of untold value to the country in the future, and may be a contributing factor to the peace of the world.
I am very happy, due to the fact that I am here on vacation, to present these diplomas to these able and distinguished young men from Maine to California, literally.
Note: The President spoke at 2:45 p.m.
