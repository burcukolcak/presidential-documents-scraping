Special Message to the Congress on U.S. Participation in the World Health Organization.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith for your consideration a suggested Joint Resolution providing for United States membership and participation in the World Health Organization. I also am enclosing a memorandum from the Secretary of State with reference to United States membership in the World Health Organization.
I have been impressed by the spirit of international good will and community of purpose which have characterized the development of the Constitution of this Organization. I am sure that it will make a substantial contribution to the improvement of world health conditions through the years.
In view of the significance and urgency of international health problems, I consider it important that the United States join the World Health Organization as soon as possible. Therefore, I hope that the suggested Joint Resolution may have the early consideration of Congress.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: The joint resolution was approved by the President on June 14, 1948 (62 Stat. 441).
Secretary Marshall's memorandum, enclosed with the President's message, is printed in House Document 177 (Both Cong., 1st sess.).
