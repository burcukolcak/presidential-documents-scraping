By virtue of the authority vested in me by sections 934 (b) and 935 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946, approved August 13, 1946, 60 Stat. 1028, 1029 and in the interest of the internal management of the Government, I hereby prescribe the following regulations governing the transfer of leave of persons assigned to the Foreign Service Reserve from other Government agencies and subsequently reinstated in such agencies, and of persons who resign from other Government agencies and accept appointments in the Foreign Service of the United States or who resign from the Foreign Service to accept appointments in other Government agencies:
1. Any person coming with the purview of sections 934 (b) and 935 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946 who elects to transfer his accumulated and accrued current annual leave from another Government agency to the Foreign Service or from the Foreign Service to another Government agency shall be required to transfer all of such leave up to the maximum amount of annual leave which may accumulate and accrue in the agency into which such person is entering as of the date of his entrance.
2. In computing transfers of leave effected under the provision of sections 934 (b) and 935 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946, five work-days of leave shall be regarded as equivalent to seven calendar days of leave.
3. The provision of section 935 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946 that "in no event shall the amount of annual or sick leave of absence so transferred exceed the maximum amount of the annual or sick leave of absence which may be accumulated in either the Service or the Government agency to which such person is appointed" shall be construed to mean that in no event shall the amount of annual or sick leave so transferred exceed the maximum amount of annual or sick leave which may accumulate and currently accrue in either the Foreign Service or the Government agency to which such person is appointed, as the case may be.
4. This order shall become effective as of November 13, 1946.
