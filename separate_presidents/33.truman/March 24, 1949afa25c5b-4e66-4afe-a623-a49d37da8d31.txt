Statement by the President Upon Signing Resolution for the Relief of Palestine Refugees.
IT IS with gratification that I have today signed Senate Joint Resolution 36 authorizing a special contribution by the United States of $16 million for the relief of Palestine refugees.
The United Nations General Assembly on November 19, 1948, urged all States members of the United Nations to make voluntary contributions as soon as possible to a relief fund totaling $32 million. The Secretary of State informs me that thus far 15 other members of the United Nations have contributed and that other governments have signified their intention to send money or contributions in kind. There is a pressing need for this fund, for 700,000 refugees are living almost on starvation level. It is the hope of the United States that very promptly the total $32 million fund will be subscribed by the members of the United Nations, or other countries, which have not yet given to the fund.
I trust that before this relief program is ended means will be devised for the permanent solution of the refugee problem, and that the efforts of the Palestine Conciliation Commission to establish a lasting peace will bring hope of a brighter future to these destitute victims of the recent hostilities in the Holy Land.
Note: As enacted, Senate Joint Resolution 36 is Public Law 25, 81st Congress (63 Stat. 16).
