Message to Secretary General Trygve Lie on the Anniversary of the United Nations First Meeting in the United States.
ON THIS, the first anniversary of the first meeting in the United States of an organ of the United Nations, I send you greetings on behalf of the Government and people of the United States. The American people are deeply grateful that the Seat of the United Nations has been located in their country. They believe in the future of the United Nations with firm conviction. During its first year in the United States the United Nations has made a good beginning upon the great and difficult task of building a peaceful world. The United States, in all its acts, seeks to add strength to the United Nations and to give effect to the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. May I add a personal word of thanks to you, Mr. Secretary General, for the strong and steadfast manner in which you have performed the high duty entrusted to you as the impartial servant of the United Nations and its 55 Member Countries in the cause of peace.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
