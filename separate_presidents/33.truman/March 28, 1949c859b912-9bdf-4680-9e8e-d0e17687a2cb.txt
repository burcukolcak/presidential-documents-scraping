Whereasunsafe practices continue to cause needless injuries and death to farm people; and
Whereaswidespread adoption of safer ways of working and living would save thousands of people from tragic injury or accidental death:

I also urge each member of every farm family to study the hazards associated with rural life with a view to performing all tasks in the safest manner possible every day throughout the year.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Doneat the City of Washington this 28th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third.
