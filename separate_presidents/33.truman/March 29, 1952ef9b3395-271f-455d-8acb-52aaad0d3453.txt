Whereasaccidents caused by indifference and thoughtlessness continue to rob the Nation of the lives and services of thousands of farm residents each year; and
Whereasthe number of these unnecessary casualties can be greatly reduced by the exercise of caution and intelligent effort on the part of each farm family; and
Whereasthe conservation of manpower and of property is vital to national defense;
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the nation to observe the week beginning July 20, 1952, as National Farm Safety Week, and I urgently request every farm resident to cooperate in carrying out effective safety measures. I also request all organizations and persons interested in farm life to join in a campaign to emphasize the importance of developing attitudes toward safety which will help prevent accidents on the farm and elsewhere.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Doneat the City of Washington this 29th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth.
