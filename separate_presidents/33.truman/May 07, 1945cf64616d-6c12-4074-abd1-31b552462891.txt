Statement by the President on the Timing of the Announcement of the German Surrender.
I HAVE AGREED with the London and Moscow governments that I will make no announcement with reference to surrender of the enemy forces in Europe or elsewhere until a simultaneous statement can be made by the three governments. Until then, there is nothing I can or will say to you.
Note: Later in the day a White House release stated that on the basis of reports received the President "confidently expects to make an announcement to the nation by radio at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning." The release added that unless unforeseen developments caused a change in plans a press conference would be called at 8:30 a.m. at which time the press and radio would be given in confidence the text of the President's radio remarks.
