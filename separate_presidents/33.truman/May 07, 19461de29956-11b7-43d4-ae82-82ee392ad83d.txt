Statement by the President Commending CARE.
THE GOVERNMENT of the United States is doing its best to take care of the food crisis in Europe at the present time, and UNRRA functions especially for this purpose. But individual Americans and groups of us can also send packages to friends, relatives or for general distribution when famine looms so closely over there. The Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe will supplement UNRRA and act as a means for the whole country to provide a hungry person in Europe with food enough for three or four weeks. I commend it to the people of the United States.
Note: This statement was made public as part of a White House release stating that the President had that day purchased 100 CARE packages. The release further stated that Lt. Gen. W. N. Haskell, Executive Director of CARE, in thanking the President, expressed the hope that his "fine example" would be followed "by hundreds of thousands of American citizens."
