Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Extending the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940.
I AM reluctantly giving my approval to this legislation. I do not wish this approval to be interpreted as expressing my concurrence in Section 2 of the Bill, which places added restrictions on the War and Navy Departments in their management of the fighting forces. I sign the legislation only because the immediate extension of the Selective Service Act is of compelling necessity in the continuance of military operations against Japan.
Note: As enacted, the bill extending the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 is Public Law 54, 79th Congress (59 Stat. 166).
