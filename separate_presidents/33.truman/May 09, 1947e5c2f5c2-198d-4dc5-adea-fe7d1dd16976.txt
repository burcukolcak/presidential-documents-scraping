Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Requesting Appropriations for the Employees Loyalty Program.
Sir:
I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress supplemental estimates of appropriation for the fiscal year 1947 for the Civil Service Commission in the amount of $16,160,000, and for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, in the amount of $8,740,000, in all $24,900,000.
The details of these estimates, the necessity therefor, and the reasons for their submission at this time are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, transmitted herewith, in whose comments and observations thereon I concur.

Respectfully yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Joseph W. Martin, Jr., The Speaker, The House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.]
Note: The White House release announcing the President's action stated that the funds were needed to carry out the purposes of Executive Order 9835, prescribing procedures for the administration of the employees loyalty program (3 CFR, 1943-1948 Comp, p. 627). The release noted that the order was signed March 21 following a report to the President by his Temporary Commission on Employee Loyalty, appointed in November 1946.
The release also made public the greater part of the Budget Director's letter. It outlines the methods to be followed in the preliminary screening of both employees and applicants, together with the provision for a full field investigation in the event that derogatory information is uncovered or in the case of sensitive positions. This letter, except for the details of the appropriation estimates, is essentially a summary of the loyalty procedures set forth in the Executive order. The letter is printed in House Document 242 (80th Cong., 1st sess.).
