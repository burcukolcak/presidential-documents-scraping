Statement by the President Upon Meeting the President-Elect of the Philippines.
I WAS HAPPY to meet today the newly elected President of the Philippine Commonwealth, who will, on July 4, be proclaimed President of the Republic of the Philippines.
General Roxas will have, as President Osmena has had, the full and heartfelt cooperation of the United States Government in the many mutual concerns of Philippine-American relations. The United States is committed to the advancement of the national welfare of the infant Republic. We sympathize with the plight of the heroic Philippine people. We shall continue to do whatever we can to help them on the road to economic recovery and national prosperity.
We discussed some of the more immediate needs of the Commonwealth. President-elect Roxas was authorized by President Osmena to speak for the Philippine nation in these discussions. I expect to see General Roxas again before he leaves. The discussions will go forward with other officials of this Government.
