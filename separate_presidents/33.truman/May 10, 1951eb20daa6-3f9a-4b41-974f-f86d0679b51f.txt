Harry S. Truman
May 10, 1951

Letter to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House Recommending Legislation Extending Benefits to Veterans of the Korean Action.
Dear Mr.____________:
Attached is a draft of legislation which would extend certain benefits to persons who shall have served in the Armed Forces on or after June 27, 1950.
I believe the desirability of such legislation will be readily apparent to the Congress. Unless and until such legislation is enacted, certain individuals already separated from the military service, and whose needs are acute, will be denied medical and hospital care.
In view of this situation, I hope the Congress will take favorable action on this legislation at the earliest possible date.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: This is the text of identical letters addressed to the Honorable Alben W. Barkley, President of the Senate, and to the Honorable Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House of Representatives.
On May 11, 1951, the President signed a joint resolution which extended the same medical and hospital benefits enjoyed by veterans of World War II to any person who had served in the U.S. Armed Forces on or after June 27, 1950 (65 Stat. 40).
