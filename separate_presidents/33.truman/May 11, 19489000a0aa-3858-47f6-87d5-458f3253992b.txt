Statement by the President Following an Exchange of Views in Moscow Between the U.S. Ambassador and the Foreign Minister.
WITH REGARD to the recent exchange of views between Ambassador Smith and Foreign Minister Molotov in Moscow, it was felt by this Government that in view of the adoption of the European recovery program as a definite expression of policy and of the President's recent recommendations to Congress concerning the military establishment, it was important that there should be no misconception or confusion in the minds of the Soviet Government concerning the position of this Government.
Accordingly, Ambassador Smith was directed to seek an interview with Mr. Molotov in order to set forth as clearly as could be expressed the policies and purposes of the United States with regard to the Soviet Union, and thus avoid any unfortunate misunderstanding in view of the character of the current propaganda statements.
The statement made by Ambassador Smith represented no new departure in American policy. It was a reiteration of the American position as it has been repeatedly expressed both publicly and privately.
The two salient points of the statement made by Ambassador Smith were these:
"The policies of the United States Government in international questions have been made amply clear in recent months and weeks. They have the support of the overwhelming majority of the American people. They will continue to be vigorously and firmly prosecuted.
"On the other hand, this Government wishes to make it unmistakably clear that the United States has no hostile or aggressive designs whatsoever with respect to the Soviet Union."
Note: The statements of Ambassador Walter Bedell Smith and Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov, dated May 4, are printed in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 18, p. 679).
