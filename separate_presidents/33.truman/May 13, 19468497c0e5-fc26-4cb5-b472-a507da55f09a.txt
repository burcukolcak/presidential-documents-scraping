CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE MEDAL FOR MERIT

TO

WILLIAM DOUGLAS PAWLEY
WILLIAM DOUGLAS PAWLEY, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the United Nations. Mr. Pawley, with keen foresight, urged the strategic importance of defending the Burma Road as early as 1937. Through his indomitable will and perseverance, such defense was made possible. His initiative provided the means of action in the air which proved an important factor in preserving the Republic of China. Mr. Pawley accepted the responsibility for employment of the American Volunteer Group (The Flying Tigers), and through his untiring efforts this splendid company of volunteers was assembled and transported to China. When air action proved impossible because of damaged planes, without hesitation he assumed leadership and at great personal risk brought from other fronts the needed materiel. In spite of danger, he joined them in the field, and by procuring necessary supplies and providing maintenance and repairs made possible the heroic resistance which the American Volunteer Group offered in defense of Rangoon. His courage and fighting spirit are in keeping with the finest traditions.
