Letter to the Speaker Transmitting Supplemental Appropriation Estimates for the National Military Establishment.
Sir:
I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of the Congress supplemental estimates of appropriation in the amount of $2,434,441,000 for the fiscal year 1949 for the National Military Establishment, in the form of amendments to the Budget for the said fiscal year.
These estimates, and the estimate of $725,000,000 for aircraft procurement submitted on April 8, 1948, represent increased military requirements to carry out the purposes indicated in my address to the Congress on March 17, 1948.
This program raises many questions as to the effect on the national economy. Military strength is dependent on a strong economic system and a strong industrial and productive capacity, and whenever increases in military strength are being considered, the effect on the national economy must be weighed. I have therefore informed the Secretary of Defense of my desire to review the entire military program in September and again in December in order to arrive at a level of expenditures for the National Military Establishment which can be supported on a sound basis in subsequent years.
The details of these estimates, the necessity therefor, and the reasons for their submission at this time are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, transmitted herewith, in whose comments and observations thereon I concur.

Respectfully yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Speaker of the House of Representatives]
