Statement by the President Upon Disapproving Bills of the Legislature of Puerto Rico
I HAVE TODAY withheld my approval of Senate Bill 195 and Senate Bill 196, which were passed by the Legislature of Puerto Rico over the veto of the Governor. Senate Bill 195 provides for a plebiscite on the permanent political status of Puerto Rico. Senate Bill 196 provides for a poll of qualified voters of Puerto Rico for the purpose of recommending one of their citizens for appointment as Governor in the event a vacancy should arise before the permanent political status of the Island is resolved.
I have consistently favored and have recommended to the Congress that legislation be enacted submitting various alternatives to the people of Puerto Rico with respect to their permanent political status, in order to ascertain through that medium what the people of Puerto Rico themselves most desire for their political future. I have also stated in this connection that in the interest of good faith the Congress should not submit any proposals to the people of Puerto Rico which it is not prepared to enact finally into law. I reiterate my position and hope the Congress will take prompt action.
Approval of Senate Bill 195, however, might erroneously be construed by the people of Puerto Rico as a commitment that the United States would accept any plan that might be selected at the proposed plebiscite, and if the plan thus selected should not be acceptable to the Congress, it could then be argued that the United States was not keeping faith with the expressed will of the people of Puerto Rico. In view of this possibility, and the harmful effect that such a misunderstanding would have on our relations with the people of Puerto Rico, this measure ought not, in my opinion, to be allowed to become law. The same principle is also applicable to Senate Bill 196.
