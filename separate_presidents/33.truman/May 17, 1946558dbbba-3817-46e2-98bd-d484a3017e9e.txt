Executive Order 9727â€”Possession, Control, and Operation of Certain Railroads
WHEREAS after investigation I find and proclaim that as a result of labor disturbances there are interruptions, or threatened interruptions, of the operations of the transportation systems, plants, and facilities owned or operated by carriers by railroad named in the list attached hereto and made a part hereof; that the war effort will be unduly impeded and delayed by such interruptions; that it has become necessary to take possession and assume control of the said transportation systems, plants, and facilities for purposes that are needful or desirable in connection with the present wartime emergency; and that the exercise, as hereinafter specified, of the powers vested in me is necessary to insure in the national interest the operation of the said transportation system, plants, and facilities:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including section 9 of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 as amended by section 3 of the War Labor Disputes Act (57 Stat. 164), the Act of August 29, 1916 (39 Stat. 619, 645), and the First War Powers Act, 1941 (55 Stat. 838), as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, it is hereby ordered as follows:
1. Possession and control of the transportation systems, plants, and facilities owned or operated by the carriers by railroad named in the list attached hereto and made a part hereof are hereby taken and assumed, through the Director of the Office of Defense Transportation (hereinafter referred to as the Director), as of four o'clock P. M., May 17, 1946; but such possession and control shall be limited to real and personal property and other assets used or useful in connection with the operation of the transportation systems of the said carriers. If and when the Director finds it necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this order, he may, by appropriate order, take possession and assume control of all or any part of any transportation system of any other carrier by railroad located in the continental United States.
2. The Director is directed to operate, or arrange for the operation of, the transportation systems, plants, and facilities taken under or pursuant to the order in such manner as he deems necessary to assure to the fullest possible extent continuous and uninterrupted transportation service.
3. In carrying out the provisions of this order the Director may act through or with the aid of such public or private instrumentalities or persons as he may designate, and may delegate such of his authority as he may deem necessary or desirable, with power of successive redelegation. The Director may issue such general and special orders, rules and regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions, and to accomplish the purposes, of this order. All Federal agencies shall comply with the directives of the Director issued pursuant to this order and shall cooperate to the fullest extent of their authority with the Director in carrying out the provisions of this order.
4. The Director shall permit the management of carriers whose transportation systems, plants, and facilities have been taken under, or which may be taken pursuant to, the provisions of this order to continue their respective managerial functions to the maximum degree possible consistent with the purposes of this order. Except so far as the Director shall from time to time otherwise provide by appropriate order or regulation, the boards of directors, trustees, receivers, officers, and employees of such carriers shall continue the operation of said transportation systems, plants, and facilities, including the collection and disbursement of funds thereof, in the usual and ordinary course of the business of the carriers, in the names of their respective companies, and by means of any agencies, associations, or other instrumentalities now utilized by the carriers.
5. Except so far as the Director shall from time to time otherwise determine and provide by appropriate orders or regulation, existing contracts and agreements to which carriers whose transportation systems, plants, and facilities have been taken under, or which may be taken pursuant to, the provisions of this order are parties, shall remain in full force and effect. Nothing in this order shall have the effect of suspending or releasing any obligation owed to any carrier affected hereby, and all payments shall be made by the persons obligated to the carrier to which they are or may become due. Except as the Director may otherwise direct, there may be made, in due course, payments of dividends on stock, and of principal, interest; sinking funds, and all other distributions upon bonds, debentures, and other obligations; and expenditures may be made for other ordinary corporate purposes.
6. Subject to applicable provisions of existing law, including the orders of the Office of Defense Transportation issued pursuant to Executive Order 8989, as amended, the said transportation systems, plants, and facilities shall be managed and operated under the terms and conditions of employment in effect at the time possession is taken under this order. The Director shall recognize the right of the workers to continue their membership in labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing with the representatives of the owners of the carriers, subject to the provisions of applicable statutes and Executive Orders, as to matters pertaining to wages to be paid or conditions to prevail after termination of possession and control under this order; and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of such collective bargaining or for other mutual aid or protection, provided that in his opinion such concerted activities do not interfere wit the operation of the transportation systems, plants, and facilities taken hereunder, or which may be taken pursuant hereto.
7. Except as this order otherwise provides and except as the Director may otherwise direct, the operation of the transportation systems, plants, and facilities taken hereunder, or which may be taken pursuant hereto, shall be in conformity with the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, the Railway Labor Act, as amended, the Safety Appliance Acts, the Employers' Liability Acts, and other applicable Federal and State laws, Executive Orders, local ordinances, and rules and regulations issued pursuant to such laws, Executive Orders, and ordinances.
8. Except with the prior written consent of the Director, no receivership, reorganization, or similar proceeding affecting any carrier whose transportation system, plants, and facilities are taken hereunder, or which may be taken pursuant hereto, shall be instituted, and no attachment by mesne process, garnishment, execution, or otherwise shall be levied on or against any of the real or personal property or other assets of any such carrier, provided that nothing herein shall prevent or require approval by the Director of any action authorized or required by any interlocutory or final decree of any United States court in reorganization proceedings now pending under the Bankruptcy Act or in any equity receivership cases now pending.
9. For the purposes of paragraphs 1 to 8, inclusive, of this order, there are hereby transferred to the Director the functions, powers, and duties vested in the Secretary of War by that part of section 1 of the said Act of August 29, 1916, reading as follows:
"The President, in time of war, is empowered, through the Secretary of War, to take possession and assume control of any system or systems of transportation, or any part thereof, and to utilize the same, to the exclusion as far as may be necessary of all other traffic thereon, for the transfer or transportation of troops, war material and equipment, or for such other purposes connected with the emergency as may be needful or desirable."
10. The Director may request the Secretary of War to furnish protection for persons employed or seeking employment in the plants, facilities, or transportation systems of which possession is taken hereunder, or which may be taken pursuant hereto, to furnish protection for such plants, facilities, and transportation systems, and to furnish equipment, manpower, and other facilities or services deemed necessary by the Director to carry out the provisions, and to accomplish the purposes, of this order. The Secretary of War is authorized and directed, upon such request, to take such action as he deems necessary to furnish such protection, equipment, manpower, or other facilities or services.
11. From and after four o'clock p.m., on the said 17th day of May, 1946, all properties taken under this order shall be conclusively deemed to be within the possession and control of the United States without further act or notice.
12. Possession, control, and operation of any plant or facility, or of any transportation system, or any part thereof, or of any real or personal property taken under this order, or which may be taken pursuant hereto, shall be terminated by the Director when he determines that such possession, control, and operation are no longer necessary to carry out the provisions, and to accomplish the purposes, of this order.
