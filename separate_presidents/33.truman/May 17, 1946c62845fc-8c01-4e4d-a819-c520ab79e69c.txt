Statement by the President Upon Issuing Order Directing Possession and Operation of the Railroads.
I HAVE TODAY by Executive Order directed J. Monroe Johnson, Director of the Office of Defense Transportation, to take over the country's railroads and operate them in the name of the United States Government.
A strike has been called for 4 p.m. tomorrow by two of the twenty railroad labor organizations--the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. These two have declined to accept the findings and recommendations of an Emergency Board created by the President under the Railway Labor Act. In the strike situation thus confronting us, governmental seizure is imperative for the protection of the rights of our citizens.
It is essential to the public health and to the public welfare generally that every possible step be taken by the Government to "assure to the fullest possible extent continuous and uninterrupted transportation service."
I call upon every employee of the railroads to cooperate with the Government to this end by remaining on duty.
I have asked the parties involved to continue negotiations with the view to reaching an agreement whereby the railroads can be returned to private ownership at the earliest possible date.
Note: The President referred to Executive Order 9727 "Possession, Control, and Operation of Certain Railroads" (3 CFR, 1943-1948 Comp., p. 531). On the same day the White House released a statement outlining the history of the railroad labor negotiations.
