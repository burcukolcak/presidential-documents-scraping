Harry S. Truman
May 19, 1949

Letter to Harvey S. Firestone, Jr., in Response to His Report on the United Service Organizations.
Dear Mr. Firestone:
I very much appreciate your report on the organization of the new peacetime USO. As I told you in our conference today, it will have the complete backing of the Government. It is good to know that the six great voluntary agencies which ran USO through the war years, and which broadly represent the three main religious groupings of our citizens, will again be channels for the USO activities.
For the most part, our armed forces are civilian volunteers. Most of them--six out of ten--are under 20 years of age. We can show them our gratitude through our wholehearted support of the USO. Soon they will be returning to their homes. We want them to return as good citizens, proud of the treatment they have received.
I am particularly happy to see Veterans Hospital Camp Shows included in the program of the USO. They serve the double purpose of entertaining the men and giving them the much-needed assurance that they are remembered.
I wish the USO abundant success in its vitally important task.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Mr. Harvey S. Firestone, Jr., President, United Service Organizations, Inc., 350 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York.]
