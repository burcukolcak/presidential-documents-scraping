GENERAL MATTHEW B. RIDGWAY, USA
for exceptionally meritorious service in a duty of great responsibility:
General Matthew B. Ridgway, United States Army, has distinguished himself by exceptionally meritorious service to the United States and to the free people of the world in positions of great responsibility. At an extremely critical period, he assumed command of the United States Eighth Army and of United Nations forces in Korea and through magnificent personal leadership led these forces in a counter-offensive which crushed the Communist advance and drove the enemy north of the 38th parallel.
In April 1951 General Ridgway became Commander-in-Chief of United States forces in the far East and Supreme Commander, Allied Powers in Japan. In addition to directing United Nations strategy and guiding the armistice negotiations in Korea with skill and firm forbearance, he supervised, on behalf of the Allied Powers, the final stages of the rebirth of the Japanese people as an independent nation. In these grave responsibilities he displayed the highest order of physical and moral courage, skillful leader. ship, and broad understanding.
General Ridgway's extraordinary service merits the gratitude not only of the American people but of free peoples everywhere.
Note: The citation was presented by the President following his address at the sesquicentennial convocation of the United States Military Academy (Item 131). General Ridgway had accompanied the President on the trip from Washington.
