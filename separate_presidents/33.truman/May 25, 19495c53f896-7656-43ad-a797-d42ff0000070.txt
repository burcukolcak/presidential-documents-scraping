Harry S. Truman
May 25, 1949

Remarks Upon Receiving the Robert S. Abbott Memorial Award
THANK YOU very much. I appreciate it, and hope very much that I will continue to deserve it.
The statement was made, I think before the election last fall, that the principles for which we are fighting are just as old as the Constitution of the United States, and just as new as the Democratic Platform of 1948.
We are pressing for the implementation of that platform, and shall continue to press for it until we accomplish the purpose which was set out. That's about all I can say.
Note: The President spoke at 12:45 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House.
The Robert S. Abbott Award was established in memory of the founder of the Chicago Defender.
Presentation of the plaque, engraved with the award citation, was made by John H. Sengstacke, nephew of the late Mr. Abbott, and editor and publisher of the Chicago Defender. The award read: "To President Harry S. Truman for his advocacy of full civil rights for all Americans regardless of race, color or creed. The President's civil rights program fulfills a dream long cherished."
