Harry S. Truman
November 06, 1951

Remarks to Members of the Executive Committee of the Polish Legion of American Veterans.
Mr. Commander:
I appreciate this statement of yours very much. I have always, all my life, been interested in Poland, because Poland has been through, I guess, as much suffering as any other one country in the world.
But Poland has always survived the bad years and has come to life again. And Poland will come to life again, I am sure, because the Polish people are liberty-loving people, and always have been liberty-loving people.
I have another very good reason for admiring Poland, because of your Prime Minister, Paderewski and his music, which I love very much. One of the few themes I can still play is Paderewski's Minuet.
I hope that Poland will continue the struggle, and that the time will come when Poland will again be a free country among the free nations of the world.

I am sure that time will come.
Note: The President spoke in the Rose Garden at the White House at 12:15 p.m. His opening words "Mr. Commander" referred to George L. Mark of Cleveland, Ohio, commander of the Polish Legion of American Veterans.
The organization presented President Truman with a portrait of himself painted in Warsaw in 1946 by Bernard Frydrysiak.
