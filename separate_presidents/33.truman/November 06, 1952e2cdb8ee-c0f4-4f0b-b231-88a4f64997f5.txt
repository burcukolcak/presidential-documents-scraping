Statement by the President on the Death of Representative Adolph J. Sabath of Illinois.
IN THE DEATH of Adolph J. Sabath the country has lost a public servant of rare distinction.
Adolph Sabath served in the Congress longer than any other Member in its entire history. Mr. Sabath became a Member of Congress on March 4, 1907, and served without interruption from that day until his death. He was chosen by the people of his congressional district to represent them in a total of twenty-four elections. He served under eight Presidents of the United States and ten Speakers of the House.
Judge Sabath, as he was known to his friends, exemplified in his life the virtues that make America strong.
During all of his years of service, Adolph Sabath never forgot his own humble origin. In him the forgotten man always found a champion. He was the sponsor of much progressive legislation and was an unyielding opponent of special interests. He served well both his constituents and his country and he was greatly beloved by all who knew him.
