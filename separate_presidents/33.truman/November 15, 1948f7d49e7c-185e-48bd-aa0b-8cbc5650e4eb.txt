Telegrams on the Occasion of the Retirement of Prime Minister Mackenzie King.
ON THIS day when you are bringing to a close your long and honored career as Prime Minister of Canada, I wish to extend the congratulations of the American people on your manifold achievements in office and particularly on your unrivaled contributions to the cementing of the firm friendship of our two countries which is without parallel in these times of stress. I feel certain that even though you no longer hold the reins of government, the wisdom of your long experience will always be available at need to the people of Canada and of the world. Kindest personal regards.
