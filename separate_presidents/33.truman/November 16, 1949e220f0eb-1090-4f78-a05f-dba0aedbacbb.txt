Remarks Upon Accepting Report of the U.S. Committee for the U.N. International Children's Emergency Fund.
I AM very happy to accept this report from the United States Committee for the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund. I want to express my appreciation of the effective work the Committee has done in keeping the people of the United States in touch with this important activity of the United Nations.
The report tells the dramatic story of a great humanitarian effort to meet the emergency needs of children growing out of the war. I note that this is entitled "Consider These Children." Those three words convey a message I should like to send across the land.
One of the greatest tragedies which the war could produce would be a generation of children whose minds and bodies were stunted and warped. The establishment of lasting peace depends in large measure upon whether these children, who will shape the future, have healthy bodies and a normal and happy outlook on life.
I hope that this story will be brought to the attention of people throughout the Nation. Their interest in the children of other lands has already been expressed through support of this United Nations effort and the work of American voluntary agencies. I am sure that our citizens will want to do everything possible to join with the peoples of other countries in extending help to children.
Note: The President spoke at 11:30 a.m. at the White House. The report was presented to the President by Mrs. Oswald B. Lord, chairman of the U.S. Committee for the U.N. International Children's Emergency Fund. The report "Consider These Children" (8 pp.) was published by the Committee.
