Message to the Congress Transmitting Second Report on the Mutual Security Program.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith the Second Report on the Mutual Security Program, covering operations during the first 6 months of 1952 in furtherance of the purposes of the Mutual Security Act of 1951 (Public Law 165, 82d Cong.). The report reviews the steps that we have taken with other nations to work for peace and security.
The Mutual Security Program is a positive program for peace. It is absolutely essential to the security of the United States. At a time when one nation is bent upon world conquest--as the Soviet Union is today--other nations, large or small, have but two real choices: To pay the ransom of appeasement or to pay the price of building together sufficient strength--military, economic, political, and moral strength--to keep the 'peace. The United States and other free nations have chosen to build up their strength. That is what the Mutual Security Program is all about.
During the 6-month period reviewed in this report, real progress was made in strengthening the free world. Although much remains to be done, we are heading in the right direction. If we keep on, if each of the partners in this joint effort makes every effort to meet problems in a sensible manner, we shall eventually reach our goal of a secure, peaceful, and confident world.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
