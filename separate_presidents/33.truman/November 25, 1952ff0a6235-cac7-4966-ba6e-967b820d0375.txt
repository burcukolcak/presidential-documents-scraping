Harry S. Truman
November 25, 1952

Remarks to a Group of Business Paper Editors.
I DO appreciate your coming up to see the President. I guess this is seven or eight times you have been here--I don't know the exact count, but rather often, I know that, and it has always been a pleasure.
I tried the last time you were here to explain to you on that globe some of the things that the country and the world is faced with. We are still faced with the same problems, and probably will be faced with them for quite some time.
Our entire effort is of course to win the cold war and get peace in the world, and that will mean, naturally, an industrial expansion for this country and the other countries of the world. It will also mean, probably, expansion in business for you. Because I think that if things do settle down in the world--as I have always hoped that they would--the demand for American know-how, and American machinery, and American gadgets of all sorts will be unlimited in the countries that are slowly and gradually moving forward and improving their standard of living. They will want all these things which we know how to make, and they will want some of our know-how as well, so they can make some of them themselves.
And that is where you come in. Your papers and your organizations tell them how to do it, and I hope you will keep up that program as you always have.
And as Paul here said, I hope that there won't be an entire severance of our acquaintanceship, because I am going back to the farm. I may be able to give you some yellow-legged chickens sometime, from that part of the world.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 11:40 a.m. During his remarks he referred to Paul Wooton, chairman of the Executive Committee of the Society of Business Magazine Editors.
