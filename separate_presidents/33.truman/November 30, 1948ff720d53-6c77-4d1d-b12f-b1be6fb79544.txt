Harry S. Truman
November 30, 1948

Letter in Response to a Resolution on Lobbying Adopted by the International Association of Machinists.
Dear Mr. Peterson :
Thank you for your telegram of November 20th, transmitting the text of the resolution adopted by your executive council urging a Congressional investigation of lobbying activities during the 80th Congress.
I think your organization has rendered a distinct public service in taking a stand on this matter.
While it is up to the Congress to determine the subjects which it will investigate, I feel sure that a thorough investigation of lobbying activities would have a very salutary effect, and I would be glad to see such an investigation undertaken.

Sincerely,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Mr. Eric Peterson, General Secretary-Treasurer, International Association of Machinists, Ninth Street and Mt. Vernon Place, N.W., Washington, D.C.]
Note: Mr. Peterson's telegram and the text of the resolution were released with the President's reply.
