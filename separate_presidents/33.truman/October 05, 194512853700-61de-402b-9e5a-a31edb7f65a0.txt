Letter Accepting Resignation of J. A. Krug as Chairman of the War Production Board.
[ Released October 5, 1945. Dated October 4, 1945 ]
My dear Cap:
I have your letter in which you request to be relieved of your responsibilities as Chairman of the War Production Board. It is with regret that I accede to your wishes and accept your resignation as Chairman, effective at the close of business on November 3, 1945.
You have earned the thanks of the Nation indeed of the United Nations--for an epic achievement in industrial production. During the critical months which have ensued since you assumed duties, first as Acting Chairman, and now for more than a year as Chairman, the results have been little short of miraculous. The prodigious tasks which have been performed by American industry under your leadership are reflected in the capitulation of our enemies in unconditional surrender.
For the magnificent work that you have done I desire to express the Nation's gratitude. As we go into the reconversion period, we shall like to think that we can call upon you from time to time for the counsel which you can give us out of your great experience.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: Mr. Krug served as Acting Chairman of the War Production Board from August 27, 1944, to October 1, 1944, and then as Chairman through November 3, 1945. His letter of resignation, dated September 25, 1945, was released with the President's reply.
