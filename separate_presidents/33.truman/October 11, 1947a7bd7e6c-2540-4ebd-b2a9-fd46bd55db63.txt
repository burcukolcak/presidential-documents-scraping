Statement by the President Making Public a Report "Manpower for Research."
I HAVE received today the fourth volume of the report on Science and Public Policy, submitted by John R. Steelman in accordance with Executive Order 9791. This volume, entitled "Manpower for Research," deals with the shortage of scientists and scientist-teachers, the implications of that shortage, and the remedial steps that must be taken.
The shortage of highly trained scientists both for teaching and for research is the basic factor which sets the limits of the Nation's scientific progress. The remedial program suggested in the report calls for financial support to colleges and universities and to deserving students. Specific ways for accomplishing these objectives are now being studied by the President's Commission on Higher Education.
Note: The fourth of the series of reports prepared by the President's Scientific Research Board is dated October 11, 1947 (Government Printing Office, 166 pp.). A summary was released with the President's statement.
The report proposes three programs to meet the problems causing the shortage referred to by the President:
1. Development of sources of financial support for educational institutions to permit expansion of faculties and increases in instructional staff and salaries--all as a part of a general program for improving higher education.
2. Development of a broad program in support of basic research in the universities to insure a foundation for applied and developmental science and a training ground for experts. To carry out such a program, a National Science Foundation should be employed to strengthen the weaker but promising institutions.
3. Establishment of a national system of scholarships and fellowships in all fields of knowledge, as the benefits under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act expire.
