Telegram to State Governors Urging Cooperation With the Citizens Food Committee.
THE DESPERATE NEED of hungry people in other countries makes the success of our voluntary food-saving program an urgent necessity. I am therefore requesting that the Governor of each of the States designate an individual or a group to work with the Citizens Food Committee to organize the activity in his State to insure the success of this war on hunger. If you have already set up a food conservation organization in your State, that organization might appropriately be designated for this purpose. Wholehearted cooperation among these State organizations, the Citizens Food Committee, and the groups appointed by the mayors of our cities will insure the success of the voluntary plan of conservation and will show the bar&pressed nations of the world an example of democracy in action that will strengthen and encourage them in their struggle for peace and security.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
