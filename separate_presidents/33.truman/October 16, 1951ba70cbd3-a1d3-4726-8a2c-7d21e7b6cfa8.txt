Messages on the Death of Liaquat Ali Khan, Prime Minister of Pakistan.
Begum Liaquat Ali Khan, Karachi, Pakistan.
I send you sincere condolences, in which Mrs. Truman and our daughter join me, in your great sorrow which has come so suddenly and under such tragic circumstances. Pakistan which under the Prime Minister's wise leadership has met and overcome so many obstacles in taking its place in the world family of nations, has suffered a grievous blow. I know the people of Pakistan, whose qualities have been so clearly reflected in the progress of your country, will carry on with calm steadfastness and wisdom.
To you I wish to convey my sorrow and that of your many American friends in the loss of your husband.
