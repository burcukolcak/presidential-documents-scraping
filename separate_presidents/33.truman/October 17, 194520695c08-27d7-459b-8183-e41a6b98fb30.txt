Memorandum on the Community War Fund Campaign in the National Capital Area.
To the Heads of the Executive Departments and Agencies:
Analysis of the present situation in the Community War Fund drive in the government service shows that to date only $900,625 has been pledged, or 41.6 percent of the Government's quota. There are only 13 days left in which to complete the quota, and clear the way for the Victory Bond drive.
I ask the members of the Cabinet and heads of independent establishments of the Federal and District Governments in this metropolitan area to do their utmost personally to hasten the coverage of their departments and agencies and to explain to the officials and employees under them the real necessity for obtaining the funds necessary to keep the various welfare and service organizations supported by the Fund going successfully for another year.
I believe that a generous response may be expected if it can be made clear to everyone that these services are still needed, in spite of the cessation of hostilities, to aid and comfort our Armed Forces at home and abroad, to give assistance to our allies in lands devastated by the war, and to maintain in our own locality the Community Chest activities which are so essential to the health and welfare of our National Capital. The fact that more than half of these latter services during the past year were rendered to government employees makes me feel certain that all will wish to contribute.
Twelve government agencies have already exceeded their quota. ask the others to push the campaign so that the quota may be reached in time to avoid overlapping the Victory Bond Drive. This will call for immediate measures on the part of department heads to speed up the campaign. It will also require special devotion and effort on the part of all the volunteer workers, as well as sympathetic understanding and response on the part of those asked to contribute.
