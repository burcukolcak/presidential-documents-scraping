Letter to the President of the Senate Commending the 81st Congress for the Accomplishments of the First Session.
Dear Mr. Vice President:
As the first session of the Eighty-first Congress draws to a close, I want to express to the Senate my appreciation for the work they have done. The Congress has been faced with many momentous problems concerning both our foreign relations and our domestic affairs. To meet these problems, the Congress has remained in Washington laboring diligently through almost ten months of the year, including one of the hottest summers in Washington history. I am confident that the American people will agree that the results have been well worth while.
I wish also to thank the members of the Senate for the courtesies they have shown to me and for the spirit which has made it possible for the Legislative and Executive branches to work together effectively.
I extend to each of you my good wishes as you return to your homes. I know from my own experience that your work does not end when a session of Congress closes. A most important part of the duties of a Member of Congress is the exchanging of views with his constituents and the studying of their problems at first hand. From that association, I hope that all of you will return next year refreshed and strengthened for the tasks that still lie ahead.
Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Alben W. Barkley, Vice President of the United States, Washington, D.C.]
