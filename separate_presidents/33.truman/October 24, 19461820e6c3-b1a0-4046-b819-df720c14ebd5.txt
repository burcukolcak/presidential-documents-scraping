Statement by the President Concerning the Estonian Refugees in Florida.
I HAVE FELT considerable personal concern over the 48 Estonians who recently displayed such courage and determination in crossing the Atlantic to our shores in two small open boats. This is the type of pioneering spirit that built this Nation.
This morning the Attorney General stayed the order requiring these people to leave the United States. This order had been issued by local officials in conformity with existing immigration regulations when it was discovered that these people had not obtained entrance visas because of over-subscription of the immigration quota for Estonians.
I have directed that all avenues be explored toward enabling this group to remain here, if they so desire, so that they may eventually become citizens of this country. The Department of State is now working on these details.
