Letter to the Governor of Puerto Rico Disapproving a Bill Passed by the Territorial Legislature.
[Released October 26, 1946. Dated October 25, 1946]
My dear Mr. Pinero:
I am returning to you, without my approval, Senate Bill No. 51, repassed over the veto of Acting Governor Manuel A. Perez by the Puerto Rican Legislature.
My reasons for disapproving the bill are similar to those expressed by the Acting Governor in his veto message, and by Governor Tugwell in his letter transmitting the bill to me. I have not considered the merits of the pedagogical program which the bill would introduce into the insular public school system. I base my disapproval, instead, on the untimeliness of the measure and my feeling that the issue of Puerto Rican political status would be confused and its solution delayed by the adoption just now of a new language policy. Important as the language question may be, I regard the reaching of a permanent and satisfactory solution to political status as of greater importance, and I cannot permit a measure to stand which in my opinion would jeopardize that solution.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Jesus T. Pinero, Governor of Puerto Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico]
Note: In the second paragraph the President referred to Rexford G. Tugwell, former Governor of Puerto Rico.
