Proclamation 2710â€”Armistice Day, 1946

Whereasthe Armistice of November 11, 1918, silenced the guns of World War I and brought to humanity hope and promise that the wars of nation against nation were at an end; and
Whereasalthough that hope and promise were shattered by the Axis aggressors in World War II, the American people are nevertheless resolved to keep faith with the heroes of both wars who sacrificed so valorously for the ideal of lasting peace; and
Whereasthe anniversary of the Armistice of 1918 provides a challenge to rededicate ourselves to the attainment of that ideal; and
Whereasthe Congress, by a concurrent resolution of June 4, 1928 (44 Stat. 1982), requested the President to issue a proclamation calling upon officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on November 11 and inviting the people to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies; and by an act of May 13, 1938 (52 Stat. 351), provided that the eleventh day of November in each year should be celebrated and known as Armistice Day and should be a legal holiday:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe November 11, 1946, as Armistice Day by honoring their fellow countrymen who fought across the seas, and by renewing their determination and their efforts to establish a lasting peace; and I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Doneat the City of Washington this 28th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first.
