CITATION FOR THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE MEDAL
MR. HOWARD BRUCE rendered exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service to the War Department in the performance of duties of great responsibility from July 1942 to June 1945. As Director of Materiel, Army Service Forces, during one of the most critical periods of the war, and in other highly important positions on the staff of the Commanding General, Army Service Forces, he displayed exceptional initiative and resourcefulness, and greatly assisted in developing and managing the greatest military procurement program in history. His leadership in conceiving and bringing to peak efficiency the Supply Control System greatly improved Army procurement methods. His early endeavors to create an orderly program to conserve critical materials helped alleviate supply shortages. His efforts in removing obstacles to production resulted in immediate and lasting improvement in the Army procurement program. With unusual perseverance and devotion to duty, Mr. Bruce contributed his energy and ability to the prosecution of the war. His accomplishments reflect great credit upon himself and the military service.
