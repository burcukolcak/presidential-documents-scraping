Letter to the Surgeon General Concerning Termination of the Nurses Training Program.
[ Released September 8, 1945. Dated September 6, 1945 ]
My dear Dr. Parran:
In view of recent developments in the course of the war, measures should be taken to bring about an early termination of the program for the training of nurses that was established by the act of June 15, 1943 (57 Stat. 153).
It appears that it will not be necessary or in the public interest to continue to initiate training courses for this program after October 15, 1945, for the purpose of assuring a supply of nurses for the armed services, Governmental and civilian hospitals, health agencies and war industries. I therefore request you to terminate the recruitment of student and graduate nurses immediately and to see to it that no students are enrolled in courses under the Act which begin after October 15, 1945.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Dr. Thomas Parran, Surgeon General, Public Health Service]
Note: The White House release of the letter noted that the President's action would permit more than 1100 nurses training schools to make necessary adjustments in their educational programs, budgets, and hospital nursing services; furthermore, it would enable some 30,000 young women enrolled under the U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps in classes then starting to receive Federal assistance toward their education.
