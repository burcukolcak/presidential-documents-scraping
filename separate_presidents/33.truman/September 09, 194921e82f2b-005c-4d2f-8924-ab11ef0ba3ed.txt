Harry S. Truman
September 09, 1949

Remarks to a Group of Bishops of the Church of England.
I AM very happy you are here. I am glad of the privilege of meeting all of you. I hope you will enjoy your tour of our country, and that our hospitality will be what you anticipate.
I think one of the greatest things that we can do is to mobilize the moral forces of the world for a real awakening of the things that originate in the Sermon on the Mount. That is what we try to live by, and if we can get all the world in that frame of mind, we will come nearer stopping these terrible wars than by any other method that I know of.
I am certainly happy that you gentlemen have been willing to tour our country and get a viewpoint from us that can be obtained no other way. I hope we can send a return delegation to see your viewpoint and get the same information from you.
I sincerely hope you will enjoy your visit.
Note: The President spoke at 3:20 p.m. in his office at the White House. The Bishops were on their way to Williamsburg, Va, for the American Church Eucharistic Congress beginning on September 1949.
