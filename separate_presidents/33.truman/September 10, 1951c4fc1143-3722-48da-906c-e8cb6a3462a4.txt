Remarks to Members of the International Council of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.
IT IS a pleasure on my part to have you here. I think you are making a contribution to the peace of the world. When an international organization of this sort can meet in the various countries where it is represented, it creates better understanding and better feeling between the peoples of those countries.
Your great organization is founded on the fraternal program, which means the brotherhood of man. I have never had the honor or the privilege of being a member of your organization, but I know what you stand for, I know what you can do for the communities where you have lodges, and I know that you are always helpful to those communities to make them better places in which to live.
I am glad you are having your meeting here, and I hope you will have a successful and pleasant one, and I am sure you will.
And I hope you will continue to grow and prosper. You know, there are a great many countries where it is not possible for organizations such as yours to grow and prosper. The United States is not one of those countries. We welcome you, and I am glad that you can be here with us.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 3:05 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House.
