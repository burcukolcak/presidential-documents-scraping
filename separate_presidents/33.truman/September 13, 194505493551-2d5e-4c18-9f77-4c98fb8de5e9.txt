Message to General Pershing on His 85th Birthday.
Dear General Pershing:
This should be one of the happiest of your many birthdays as you remember that this time we went all the way through to Berlin, as you counseled in 1918. I hail a great soldier who happily exemplified also the vision of the statesman.
With every good wish.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[General John J. Pershing, Walter Reed Hospital ]
