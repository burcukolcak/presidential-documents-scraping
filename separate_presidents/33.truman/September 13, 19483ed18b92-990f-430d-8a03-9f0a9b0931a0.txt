Proclamation 2813â€”Columbus Day, 1948

Whereasfour hundred and fifty-six years ago Christopher Columbus broadened the world's horizons through his keen vision, his indomitable spirit, and his unflagging persistence; and
Whereasthe old world which gave him birth and the new world which he discovered are now joined in closer relationship not only through modern miracles of speed but also through mutual need for the achievement of lasting peace and a higher civilization; and
Whereasit is fitting that the exploits of this gallant navigator, who has enriched the lives of all peoples by showing the way to a land of unparalleled opportunities, should be commemorated on the anniversary of his finding that land; and
Whereasthe Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating October 12 of each year as Columbus Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S.

I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Doneat the City of Washington this 13th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third.
