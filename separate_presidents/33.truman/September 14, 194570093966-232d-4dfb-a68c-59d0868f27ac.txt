Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting Proposed Reductions in Appropriations for the Navy.
[ Released September 14, 1945. Dated September 13, 1945 ]
The Speaker of the House of Representatives:
Sir: With reference to appropriations and contract authorizations for the Navy Department and naval service, I have the honor to transmit for the consideration of Congress (1) proposed rescissions of several appropriations available in the fiscal year 1946, amounting to $8,305,859,122, (2) proposed rescissions of several contract authorizations available in the fiscal year 1946, amounting to $3,212,442,131, (3) proposed rescissions of the unrequired balances of prior year appropriations, amounting to $5,306,252,674, and (4) proposed decreases in the amounts which may be transferred from various naval appropriations to the appropriations for printing and binding, and contingent expenses, for the fiscal year 1946.
In making these recommendations for reductions, consideration has been given to the tremendous problem of demobilization and the yet undetermined requirements for a peacetime Navy.
As indicated in my letter of September 5, 1945, I plan a continuing review of naval appropriations with the view to recommending further adjustments as conditions warrant. It is also suggested that the appropriate committees of Congress give consideration to a complete review of existing legislation authorizing the construction of naval vessels.
The details of these proposed rescissions are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, transmitted herewith, in whose comments and observations thereon I concur.

Respectfully yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Note: A White House release announcing the President's action pointed out that proposed rescissions (1) and (2) referred to in the first paragraph of the letter and totaling $11.5 billion included $3,212,442,131 of contract authorizations available in fiscal year 1946, and appropriations for the following major items:
Savings because of demobilization in enlisted personnel from a strength of 3,300,000 at the rate of approximately 250,000 per month; cutbacks in ship construction which permitted withdrawal of $1,047,366,607 in cash which would not be expended during fiscal year 1946; maintenance and operation of ships and Navy yards, including fuel, $1,372,183,000; aviation program, 404,300,000; ordnance, $2,550,451,000.
The details of the proposed rescissions as set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget transmitted with the President's letter, are printed in House Document 286 (79th Cong., 1st sess.).
