Remarks to the National Citizens Committee for United Nations Day.
Mrs. Johnstone and members of the United Nations Committee:
I certainly am happy to have you here this morning, and I am more than pleased that you have begun to get ready for this celebration early.
In 1947, when the United Nations General Assembly made the 24th of October United Nations Day, we didn't have time, at that time, to put on a proper celebration of the event. So, in 1948, 48 nations took notice of the 24th of October as the birthday of the United Nations, and I am exceedingly anxious that 1949 shall see an all-out celebration around the world.
In order that that all-out celebration may be a success, it is necessary that we show what we believe here. I think that the United Nations is the only bulwark we have for the peace of the world, and our support of the United Nations is absolutely essential, with everything we have, to see that the peace of the world is obtained. And I am sure we are going to obtain it, if we continue to support the United Nations with everything we have, which we have been doing up to this time.
I can't tell you how very much I appreciate your interest in this organization, and in the event which we are going to celebrate on the 24th of October. I know you will have a successful celebration, and you will have the wholehearted cooperation of the President, and the Government of the United States.
Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 11:40 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. His opening words referred to Mrs. Anne Hartwell Johnstone, vice chairman of the Committee.
