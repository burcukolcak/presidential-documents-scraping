Remarks to a Group of Actors and Officials of the Motion Picture Industry of India.
Mr. Johnston, and members of this delegation:
It is a very great privilege and a pleasure for me to welcome you here at the White House. I hope you are having a pleasant and instructive visit here, and that you will carry back to your great country an opinion of this country that will continue our friendship forever.
We are anxious, as you are, for a friendly and peaceful world all the way around. [At flash bulb exploded at this point]
There must be a Communist in the bunch--interrupted me at the psychological moment. At any rate, I know that your ideas of a peaceful world and ours coincide, and I know that you are working for peace with everything you have. That has been my objective for 7 long years and more, and I shall continue to work for that objective whether I am in office or whether I am not.
You are cordially welcome here. Any courtesies that we can cause to be extended to you, we will be glad to have them done. I know that you are in good hands, because Eric Johnston will see that you get everything that is necessary, so far as seeing the country and finding out how these gentlemen back here do their business from our end. If they are as persistent with you as they are with me, they will use up a million yards of film before you leave the country.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 11 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. His opening words referred to Eric Johnston, president of the Motion Picture Association of America.
