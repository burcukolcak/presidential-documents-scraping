Letter to Henry J. Kaiser Calling Upon Him To Head the Second United National Clothing Collection Campaign.
[ Released September 23, 1945. Dated August 21, 1945 ]
Dear Henry:
Again the need for used clothing for war sufferers all over the world is urgent. It is imperative that we act at once to provide clothing for the relief of men, women and children in war ravaged lands.
I am, therefore, calling upon you again to lead the Nation in this campaign to alleviate incalculable hardships which will be endured next winter unless we act without delay. The results achieved under your leadership earlier this year were magnificent.
Splendid as were the results of that effort, however, it is plainly evident that additional quantities of clothing must be secured to meet the tremendous war relief needs which the world now faces, not only in Europe but also in liberated areas in the Pacific. Other countries-Canada, Australia, New Zealand--will conduct collections to help meet this urgent situation, but the dire need justified another appeal to the people in the United States.
Without adequate clothing and other necessities of life to sustain victims of war on the long road to rehabilitation there can be no peace. I, therefore, ask you and the more than seven thousand local chairmen of the United National Clothing Collection to lead the Nation in another clothing collection drive for the relief of victims of war.
The universal response last spring, when all groups concerned with problems of war relief joined with United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in one great national appeal, has proven beyond any doubt the value and efficiency of the united endeavor which I now request you to carry on again.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Henry J. Kaiser, 1522 Latham Square Building, Oakland, California]
