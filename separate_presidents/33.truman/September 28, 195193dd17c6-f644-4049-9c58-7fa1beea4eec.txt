Joint Statement Following Discussions With Prime Minister St. Laurent of Canada.
THE PRESIDENT and the Prime Minister discussed the St. Lawrence project. They agreed on the vital importance to the security and the economies of both countries of proceeding as rapidly as possible with both the seaway and the power phases of the project. They explored the matter of the next steps to be taken in achieving the early construction of the project. They both agreed that it would be most desirable to proceed along the lines of the 1941 Agreement between the United States and Canada.
The Prime Minister informed the President of the needs of Ontario for power and of the arrangement the Canadian Government could make with the government of that Province for its participation with the appropriate Federal or State authority in the United States for the power development. In these circumstances, the Prime Minister indicated the Canadian Government would be willing to construct the seaway as a Canadian project if it is not possible to have the joint development undertaken on the basis of the 1941 Agreement.
The President expressed his strong preference for joint action on the Seaway and his hope that the Congress would soon authorize such action, but stated he would support Canadian action as second best if an early commencement on the joint development does not prove possible.
