Statement by the President on Announcing the Termination of the American Production Mission in China.
WHILE concluding this war mission, the American Government desires to continue its close cooperation with China. The American Production Mission is tangible evidence of the enduring friendship of our two nations. Out of our work together on problems of war production have come practical experience and mutual high regard which will be of great value to the future economic relations of our two countries and the world.
Note: This statement is part of a White House release announcing that the President was sending his Personal Representative, Edwin A. Locke, Jr., to China to discuss with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and key Chinese officials ways in which the industrial experience of the United States could best be utilized to aid sound peacetime economic reconstruction and development of China. The release stated that Mr. Locke would give particular attention to the situation confronting the Chinese as a result of China's acquisition of large industries in Manchuria and other liberated provinces. The release further stated that Mr. Locke would be accompanied by his Economic Adviser, Albert Z. Carr.
In announcing that Mr. Locke would make arrangements for terminating the work of the American Production Mission, established late in 1944 to aid China's war effort, the release stated that the Mission had maintained a staff of about 20 American industrial specialists in Chungking. The release continued: "Their close collaboration with the Chinese Government has been instrumental in obtaining increased production of munitions and basic raw materials from Free China's industrial facilities. Since the Japanese surrender the Mission has been aiding the Chinese Government in dealing with the initial problems of reconversion and industrial revival."
