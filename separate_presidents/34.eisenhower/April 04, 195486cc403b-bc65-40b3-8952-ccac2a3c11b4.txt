Statement by the President on the Fifth Anniversary of the Signing of the North Atlantic Treaty.
FIVE YEARS AGO today, the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty launched a unique working partnership among the Atlantic peoples. Their alliance for the preservation of peace and mutual defense against Communistic aggression is now a mighty bulwark of the free world.
NATO symbolizes the unity of free men in an age of peril. Fourteen nations, diverse in language and economy and custom and political structure, are joined within it because each nation is determined to sustain its own independence. Dedicated to a common purpose, their strength is multiplied, their inexhaustible energies are pooled.
During my service with NATO there were many uniforms worn, many tongues spoken at my headquarters. But daily I found new inspiration in the unity of spirit among my comrades.
The inspiration remains with me; a cherished memory, a heartening proof that free men--united--can face any peril unafraid. NATO is visible evidence that, in cooperation among the free peoples, we can best preserve our common heritage of freedom against any threat.
