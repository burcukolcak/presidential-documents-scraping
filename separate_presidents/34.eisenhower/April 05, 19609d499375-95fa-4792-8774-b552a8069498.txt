Remarks of Welcome to President Lleras Camargo of Colombia at the Washington National Airport.
Mr. President:
It is a particular honor for me and for the American people to welcome you here to this country that you know so well.
First of all, your country and ours has a long history of friendly associations, and we well remember the sacrifices that your country made in the late Korean conflict when you sent to the aid of the United Nations both military and naval forces.
But beyond this we have watched with the greatest interest your own leadership in the developing of your country, both in the spreading of the advantages of education, health facilities, democratic order, and in the leadership that has brought about the standing of Colombia ever higher among those nations that are true practices of democracy. We have seen how your efforts have resulted, and we are indeed admiring and most respectful of those accomplishments.
So when we have the opportunity today of welcoming you to this land, we do it as one that reveres those great values of freedom, of human dignity, and know that you stand with us in all of the measures that are necessary in the promotion of these values throughout the world and defeating any kind of threat that may be opposed against us.
So again I say to you, sir, welcome, and I sincerely hope that you and your party find in this country not only an instructive trip but a most enjoyable one for all of you.
And finally, that when you go back, you will convey to your own people the very best wishes and warm greetings from this, the people of this country.
Thank you very much.
