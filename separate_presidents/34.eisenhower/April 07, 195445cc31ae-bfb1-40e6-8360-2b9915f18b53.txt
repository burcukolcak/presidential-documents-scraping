Statement by the President on the Approval by the Luxembourg Parliament of the European Defense Community Treaty.
I HAVE JUST learned of the vote of the Luxembourg Parliament, approving ratification of the treaty establishing the European Defense Community. Luxembourg has thus become the fourth of the six European Defense Community nations whose Parliament has taken favorable action.
This represents further significant progress in the establishment of this Community. The integration of the defense forces of France, Germany, the Benelux nations and Italy will do much to assure conditions in Europe which will contribute to the peace and security of that area.
