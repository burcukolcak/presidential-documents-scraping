Memorandum for

The Director

Office of Defense Mobilization
Pursuant to Section 3(d) of Executive Order 10582, December 17, 1954, you are hereby designated to furnish advice to Executive agencies with respect to the rejection of bids or offers to furnish materials of foreign origin upon the ground that such rejection is necessary to protect essential national security interests.
It is my conviction that exceptions under this provision of the Executive Order should be made only upon a clear showing that the payment of a greater differential than the Order provides for is justified by considerations of national security.
