Proclamation 3344—Excluding Lands from the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument—Colorado

Whereasthe Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument, in Colorado, was established by Proclamation No. 2033 of March 2, 1933 (47 Stat. 2558), for the preservation of certain spectacular gorges and other features of scenic, scientific, and educational interest, and was enlarged by Proclamation No. 2286 of May 16, 1938 (52 Stat. 1548), and Proclamation No. 2372 of October 28, 1939 (54 Stat. 2669); and
Whereasexchanges of private and Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument have been accomplished as authorized by the act of May 1, 1958, 72 Stat. 102; and
Whereasit appears that certain hereinafter-described lands now in private or Federal ownership within the external boundaries of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument are no longer required for the proper care, protection, and management of the objects of scientific interest situated on lands within the monument, and it would be in the public interest to exclude such lands from the monument:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the act of June 8, 1906, 34 Stat. 225 (16 U.S.C. 431), do proclaim that the following-described lands are hereby excluded from the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument, and the boundaries of the monument are revised accordingly:
