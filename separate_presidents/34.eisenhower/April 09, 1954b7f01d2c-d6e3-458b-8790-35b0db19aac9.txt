Remarks at the "Help Korea" Trains Ceremony.
FIRST OF ALL, I think I may speak for the people of the United States in thanking you three gentlemen--and you, Mrs. Willkie--for your part in mobilizing the gifts of America to go to a country where they are so badly needed.
I think I can speak, also, for the nation, in thanking the railroads for being so helpful and cooperative in showing such a sympathetic attitude toward this great need.
I want to speak for just a moment about my pride in what the Army has done. The Army had a long and grueling experience out in that country, as did, of course, all our fighting forces. Yet so impressed were our soldiers by the great need out there, and by the gallantry of their ally, that they themselves contributed more than 25 million dollars. This was completely aside from all of the work they did in providing the know-how for reconstruction of schools, hospitals, roads, bridges--all the things that were destroyed in the war.
So as they excite my pride, you people excite my thanks. I am certain that all of us are going to have our sentiments stirred very deeply in this country by your efforts. I am sure the response will be everything that you expect.
Now to each of you--good luck.
Note: The President spoke in the Rose Garden at 2:30 p.m. In the opening paragraph he referred to Dr. Howard A. Rusk, President of the American Korean Foundation, Henry C. Alexander, National Chairman of the Help Korea Trains campaign, Philip A. Hollar, Vice President of the Association of American Railroads, and Mrs. Wendell L. Willkie, National Chairman of the Women's Division of the American Korean Foundation.
