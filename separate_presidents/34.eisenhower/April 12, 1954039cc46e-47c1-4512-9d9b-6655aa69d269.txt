Statement by the President on the Death of Senator Griswold of Nebraska.
I WAS SHOCKED to hear the news of the sudden and tragic passing of Dwight P. Griswold. As Governor of Nebraska, Chief of the American Mission for Aid to Greece, and as a member of the United States Senate, Senator Griswold was a devoted public servant and a distinguished legislator. Although he had served in the Senate less than two years, his long experience in government made him a valuable member of the Upper House; one whose advice and counsel were widely sought. The nation can ill afford to lose the services of such a fine American as Dwight P. Griswold.
