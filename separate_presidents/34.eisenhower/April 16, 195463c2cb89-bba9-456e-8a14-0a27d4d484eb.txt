Telegram Inviting the Governors of States Afflicted by Dust Storms To Attend Conference at the White House.
[Released April 16, 1954. Dated April 15, 1954]
I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED about the consequences of the dust storms which have afflicted your State and others in the southwestern part of the United States, coming as they have upon the heels of serious and extended drought. This concern extends not only to measures to alleviate suffering and protect property, but to measures which will meet the problem on a longer run basis. This involves all levels of government in working out a cooperative program for improved land utilization and soil conservation. You are invited, along with Governors of other seriously affected states, to attend in the Cabinet Room of the White House a conference to discuss this problem at 2:30 p.m. April 26, 1954. I am hopeful that you will find it possible to be present.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: This telegram was sent to the following Governors: Allan Shivers of Texas, Johnston Murray of Oklahoma, Edward F. Arn of Kansas, Edward L. Mechem of New Mexico, and Dan Thornton of Colorado.
