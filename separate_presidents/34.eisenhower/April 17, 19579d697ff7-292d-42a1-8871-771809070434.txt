Letter to the Reverend Edward L. R. Elson, Chairman, Good Friday Observance Committee.
[Released April 17, 1957. Dated April 16, 1957]
Dear Dr. Elson:
Throughout Christendom, Good Friday is observed as a day of solemn remembrance with the Churches of our land united in the recognition of its import.
The message of this Holy Day has deep meaning for many. It brings to mind the demanding nature of life and the unending struggle for human welfare. Hunger and disease, conflict and prejudice cannot be easily removed. They can only be overcome with great effort. The price of peace, our ultimate objective, is unceasing sacrifice and prayer.
When our Christian citizens think on these things, they will be sobered by a realistic appraisal of the needs of our age and strengthened by a new appreciation of the spiritual resources available to us all.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
