Cablegram to Llewellyn E. Thompson, Ambassador to the U. S. S. R., Concerning Awards to Van Cliburn and Other American Musicians.
Dear Mr. Ambassador:
Will you please extend my official and personal congratulations to Van Cliburn. I know that all Americans join with me in paying tribute to his artistic talents and are proud that he was awarded first prize in the International Tchaikovsky Piano Contest. When he returns to the United States, I hope he can come to the White House so that I can congratulate him personally on his triumph. It is good to see artistic talent recognized, and I believe such contests are good for a better understanding between people of all nations.
Won't you also express my best wishes to Daniel Pollack who took eighth place in the piano contest, and to Joyce Flissler who won the seventh prize in the violin competition.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
