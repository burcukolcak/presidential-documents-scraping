Cablegram to President Ibanez of Chile Concerning His Decision Not To Visit Washington.
His Excellency

Carlos Ibanez del Campo

President of the Republic of Chile

Santiago, Chile
It is with sincere regret that I have received Your Excellency's telegram in which you inform me that you have found it necessary to forego your plan to come to Washington as my guest later this month.
Mrs. Eisenhower and I had been looking forward with keen anticipation to the personal pleasure of a visit with Senors de Ibanez and you.
Your visit would undoubtedly have strengthened even further the close ties that characterize relations between Chile and the United States. I especially regret your not coming because our Governments will be deprived of a signal opportunity to review problems of mutual interest to us.
Nevertheless, I can well understand and appreciate the matters of overriding national importance which must perforce occupy the attention of the President of a great democratic nation like Chile and which have necessitated your decision.
Please accept my most sincere good wishes for your continued health and for the well being of the people of Chile.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
