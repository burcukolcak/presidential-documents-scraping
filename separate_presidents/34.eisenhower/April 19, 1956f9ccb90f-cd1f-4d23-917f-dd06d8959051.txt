Letter Appointing Members of the President's Committee on Education Beyond the High School.
Dear :
I am delighted to learn that you have agreed to serve as a member of the Committee on Education Beyond the High School, and I take pleasure in appointing you to that post. In augmenting public awareness of the increased need for educational facilities and in determining how better to assure that students will have those facilities available, you can through the work of this Committee perform a great service to the Nation.
Your deliberations will, I am confident, command the attention of every American and contribute significantly to a comprehensive and determined effort to meet our present and future educational needs. Only through such effort can we be sure of providing adequate educational facilities for the needs of tomorrow.
With best wishes for success in this undertaking,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

On March 28, 1956, the White House announced the appointment of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee: Devereaux Colt Josephs, Chairman, Board of Directors, New York Life Insurance Company, New York City, and Dr. David Dodds Henry, President of Illinois University. The announcement stated that "among the problems to be studied by the Committee will be problems of providing good teaching and housing for an expected major increase in college enrollment over the next 10 years. It will consider possible recommendations for steps to meet any shortage of scientists, engineers, or other professions. It will also be concerned with the waste of talent due to the failure of students to continue their education in high school or college until they develop their fullest capacities."
