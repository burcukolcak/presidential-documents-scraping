By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 301 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (63 Stat. 812), and as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States, section 1 of Executive Order No. 10119 of March 27, 1950, prescribing regulations governing the payment of basic allowances for subsistence to members of the uniformed services, is hereby amended to read as follows:
"SECTION 1. Enlisted members who are being subsisted in kind in a mess and whose duties require them to be absent from their station during one or more meals shall be entitled for each such meal to a prorated share of the daily basic allowance for subsistence authorized for members on duty at stations where rations in kind are net available. The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Commerce are hereby authorized to establish the amount of the prorated share of the daily basic allowance for subsistence applicable to each one of the three daily meals, which amount shall be uniform for all the services concerned. The total of the amounts of the shares for the three daily meals shall not exceed the amount of the basic daily allowance for subsistence authorized by section 301 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, as heretofore or hereafter amended."
