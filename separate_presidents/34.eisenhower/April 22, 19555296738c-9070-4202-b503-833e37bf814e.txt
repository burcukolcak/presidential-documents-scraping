Citation Presented to the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and Accompanying Remarks.
[Citation read by the President]
I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States, present this special citation to the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis for its unswerving devotion to the eradication of poliomyelitis.
The American people recognize a debt of gratitude to the Foundation and to its founder, the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose personal courage in overcoming the handicap of poliomyelitis stands as a symbol of the fight against this disease.
Without the support and encouragement of the Foundation, the work of Dr. Jonas E. Salk and of many others who contributed to the development of a preventive vaccine could not have gone forward so rapidly. The Foundation displayed remarkable faith in sponsoring and determination in fostering their valiant effort for the health of all mankind.
The generous voluntary support of the Foundation by the American people has been dramatically justified. In their name, I am privileged to make this award to the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis.
[Remarks of the President following the presentation of the citation to Basil O'Connor, President of the Foundation]
And there, of course, remains the great problem of rapid production, distribution on the fairest possible basis, and to that problem as Secretary Hobby has said, you and many others are working and contributing to carry the thing forward until there is no more poliomyelitis remaining in the United States. And I thank you and all of the Foundation of which you are President.
Note: The President spoke in the Rose Garden. Mr. O'Connor was introduced by Secretary Hobby.
