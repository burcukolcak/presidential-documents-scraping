Statement by the President: National Radio Month.
DURING THE MONTH of May the 3,600 radio stations throughout the nation will celebrate National Radio Month.

This celebration provides an opportunity to call attention to the vital role that radio plays in the daily life of the national community.
As a channel for public service, radio contributes much to the American people through programs of news, education, and entertainment. There are more than 140 million radio sets in operation in the nation. The immediacy and availability of this medium are important factors in keeping the American public informed about the tremendous news developments of our time. It also permits them to enjoy first-rate entertainment.
The National Association of Broadcasters has adopted a theme for this month of "Radio is Close to You." I am happy to join with these broadcasters and the radio industry in this annual observance.
