Memorandum Directing the Departments and Agencies to Take Part in a Civil Defense Test Exercise.
To the Heads of all Departments and Agencies:
On June 14 and 15, 1954, a nation-wide Civil Defense test exercise will be held in cooperation with the Dominion of Canada. United States Territories and Possessions will also participate.
The task of civil defense is vital to our national life. It demands preparedness that can do more than limit the damage of a war-time disaster. It means developing a preparedness, a vigilance, so impressive as to deter aggression itself. This awareness must touch every community, every citizen of our land.
Therefore, I hereby direct each department and agency of the Executive Branch of the Government, both at the national and field level, to take part in this civil defense exercise, to cooperate fully with Federal, State and local civil defense authorities, and to the extent feasible under the terms of Executive Order, dated April 22, 1954, to authorize the release of Federal employees who are enrolled in local civil defense organizations to perform such civil defense duties as are assigned during this exercise.
