Dwight D. Eisenhower
April 30, 1954

Remarks to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services.
I WANT TO SPEAK for one second, ladies, about morale. I know something about the work that you people are doing to sustain in America respect for the Armed Forces and to support them in the work that they are doing for all of us.
Morale among the Armed Forces is the indispensable ingredient, and I know something about producing it. It is this: in the field, a man is more affected by his home town, excepting letters from home, than by any other single thing.
He can have good commanders. He can be well-fed. He can be well-clothed. He can be fired and inspired by victories, but he has got to know that the home front not only respects and appreciates the work he is doing, but also is for him from top to bottom.
In doing your part to assure the Armed Forces of today, in times of, let us say, sort of peaceful cold war instead of active campaigning, you are doing more than your part.
And I, as Commander in Chief of those Forces, want to express to each of you a personal word of thanks and of appreciation.
Note: The President spoke at the Pentagon Building.
