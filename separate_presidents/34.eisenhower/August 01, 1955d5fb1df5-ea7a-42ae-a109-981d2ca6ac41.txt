Statement by the President Regarding Release of United States Airmen by Communist China.
THE ENTIRE country will feel a sense of relief and hail with joy the announcement that the eleven United States airmen held in Communist China since 1953 are at last to be released.
Our first thoughts go to the men and their families who have been separated for so long. The Government will use every appropriate facility to assure the speedy reunion of these families.
The United States extends thanks to all who have contributed to this humanitarian result, particularly the United Nations and its Secretary General who actively sought this result on behalf of the United Nations Command in which these eleven flyers served.
