Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Establishing a New Survivor Benefit Program for the Uniformed Services
I HAVE TODAY, with great satisfaction, approved H.R. 7089, an act to establish a new and equitable survivor benefit program for members and former members of the uniformed services.
The Congress, by completely revising the entire military survivorship system for the first time in many years, has given a measure of financial security to the families of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines which will enable them to face the inherent hazards and uncertainties of military life with increased confidence. Thus, this important measure will have a far-reaching effect on service personnel, at home or stationed on our widely flung posts, ships and bases around the world.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 7089 is Public Law 881, 84th Congress (70 Stat. 857).
