Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill To Improve Budgeting and Accounting Methods and Procedures.
I HAVE TODAY approved S. 3897, "To improve governmental budgeting and accounting methods and procedures, and for other purposes." This new legislation represents a major step forward toward a better budgeting and accounting system throughout the Government. Its enactment was recommended by the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government. As originally introduced, however, the bill would have provided for adoption of the accrued expenditure appropriation procedure. Such a provision in law would be highly desirable and would have many benefits both for the legislative and executive branches.
I shall recommend to the next Congress that further consideration be given to the enactment of legislation which will permit the use of accrued expenditure appropriations whenever such procedure is considered appropriate in relation to the improved budget and accounting systems developed under the new law.
Note: As enacted, S. 3897 is Public Law 863, 84th Congress (70 Stat. 782).
