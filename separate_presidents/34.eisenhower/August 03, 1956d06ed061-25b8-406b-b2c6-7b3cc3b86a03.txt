Remarks of the President During the Broadcast on the Suez Canal Situation by Secretary Dulles.
[Broadcast over radio and television from the President's Office at 7:00 p.m.]
Good evening, my fellow citizens:
All of us, of course, appreciate the tremendous importance of the Suez Canal. Its continuous and effective operation is vital to the economy of our country, indeed to the economies of almost all of the countries of the world. So all of us were vastly disturbed when Colonel Nasser a few days ago declared that Egypt intended to nationalize the Suez Canal Company.
At that moment, Secretary Dulles was in South America, but as soon as he returned and because of his great experience, his wisdom, in this kind of affair, he went at my request to London to confer with our British and French friends concerning a proper course of action.
This noon he returned. Because of the information he has and the background he can give you, I instantly asked the television industry to give him a few minutes this evening to explain to you what he can this evening, and give you a report on what he has been talking about in London.
Secretary Dulles.
[At this point Secretary Dulles spoke on the background of the Suez situation and outlined the decision agreed upon in London to call a conference to plan for international operation of the Canal. The President then resumed speaking.]
Mr. Secretary, I think that everybody who hears you this evening will be certain you carried out this latest assignment in accordance with the principle which has always activated you, to uphold the interests of the United States in the international field with due regard for fairness to every other nation, and with the objective of promoting peace in the world.

Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Dulles.
