CITATION:
For exceptionally meritorious service to the Government of the United States in a duty of great responsibility as Chief of Naval Operations and Member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for a period of two years commencing 17 August 1953. Exercising the highest quality of command leadership during this period of international tension, Admiral Carney displayed foresight and keen understanding in directing the unified commands for which he was executive agent. He greatly furthered combat readiness of Naval operating forces by insisting upon incorporating the latest scientific developments into naval construction programs. As a Member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff he participated in the formulation of strategic plans for the defense of the United States and the establishment of policy dedicated to maintaining peace and freedom throughout the world. In this capacity he fostered and promoted the most harmonious relationships among the Services. Admiral Carney's contribution to the aspirations of mankind and to the Government of the United States will always reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Naval Service.
