Letter to the Treasurer of the United States Appointing Her Chairman of the Interdepartmental Savings Bond Committee.
Dear Mrs. Priest:
I have today issued an executive order establishing the Interdepartmental Committee for the Voluntary Payroll Savings Plan for the Purchase of United States Savings Bonds. This Committee will have the function of promoting the purchase of United States Savings Bonds by employees in the Executive Branch of the Government through regular voluntary pay allotments on the Payroll Savings Plan.
The maintenance of stability in the economic life of the individual, the community and the Nation is well served by the widespread distribution of the national debt through the purchase of United States Savings Bonds by the people. It is important to the welfare of our country that this support of the national debtmanagement function be continued and fostered to the greatest extent possible. Federal employees should be encouraged to maintain their leadership in the purchase of Savings Bonds through the Payroll Savings Plan and thus by example give impetus to the movement throughout the business and industrial community.
I hereby appoint you as Chairman of the new Interdepartmental Committee.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
