Dwight D. Eisenhower

Statement by the President on the Death of Walter F. George.
THE PASSING of Walter F. George is a great loss not only to his own native State of Georgia, but also to the entire nation. It is a personal loss to me--Senator George was a good and dear friend.
As Senator and lately as my personal representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he served his country and the free world for many years with distinction and integrity. He was an outstanding American and a fine gentleman who will be greatly missed.
Mrs. Eisenhower and I extend our heartfelt sympathies to Mrs. George and to the members of her family.
