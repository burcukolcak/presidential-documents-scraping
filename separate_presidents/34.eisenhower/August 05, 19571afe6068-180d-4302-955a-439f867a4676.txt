Message to the Congress Transmitting First Report on the Promotion of Peace and Stability in the Middle East.
[ Released August 5, 1957. Dated July 31, 1957 ]
To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith the first report to the Congress -covering activities through June 30, 1957 in furtherance of the purposes of the Joint Resolution to Promote Peace and Stability in the Middle East.
The Resolution is an important milestone in our foreign policy as it relates to the Middle East. Since its approval on March 9, 1957, the Resolution has played a major role in our cooperation with nations of the area to build strength against the threat of international communism. Furthermore, it has served as an unmistakable warning to international communism against all forms of aggression. The contribution of the Resolution to international peace and stability in the Middle East will continue to grow as long as the purposes and principles it sets forth are maintained.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
