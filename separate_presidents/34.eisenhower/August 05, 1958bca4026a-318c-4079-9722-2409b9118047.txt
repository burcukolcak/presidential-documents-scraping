Statement by the President on the Forthcoming United Nations Meeting on the Mid-East.
I WELCOME Mr. Khrushchev's agreement that the problems we have had under discussion in our recent exchange of letters should be placed again before the United Nations. I regret that he did not accept the Security Council with the Heads of Government present as the appropriate forum in view of his alleged concern over the threats to the peace. However, the General Assembly is completely acceptable, particularly since the United States previously proposed on July 18th such a procedure to the Security Council.
I am therefore instructing the United States Permanent Representative to the Security Council to move the previously presented United States resolution requesting that this matter be put before the General Assembly. This resolution has been held in abeyance in order to permit consideration of Mr. Khrnshchev's proposals of July 19th, 23rd, and 28th.
Note: Mr. Khrushchev's proposals of July 19, 23, and 28 are published in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 39, PP. 231, 234, 275). The President's replies to these proposals appear as Items 177, 179, 189 above. The United States resolution is published in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 39, p. 197).
