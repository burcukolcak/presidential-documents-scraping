Memorandum of Disapproval of Bill Concerning Term of Office of Subversive Activities Control Board Members.
I AM withholding approval of S. 2171, an Act "To amend the Subversive Activities Control Act so as to provide that upon the expiration of his term of office a member of the Board shall continue to serve until his successor shall have been appointed and shall have qualified."

The language of this bill is incorporated in identical terms in S. 2375 which I have approved today. Under the circumstances, approval of S. 2171 is unnecessary and would result in a nullity and possible confusion.
