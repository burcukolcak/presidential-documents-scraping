Letter to the Governor of New York Congratulating Him on Establishing a Committee To Assist in Implementing the Refugee Relief Act.
Dear Governor Dewey:
I have today written to the Governors of each of the other states suggesting that they may wish to appoint committees to cooperate with the Administration in connection with implementing the Refugee Relief Program of 1953. I have not addressed the letter to you because you have already created such a committee and I understand that Commissioner Corsi has already had a meeting with the Administrator of this Program, to the mutual satisfaction of both of them.
I congratulate you on undertaking this work to stimulate the flow of assurances and to aid in the resettlement of these immigrants. I hope you will let Commissioner Corsi know how much we appreciate the cooperation extended by him and his associates.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
