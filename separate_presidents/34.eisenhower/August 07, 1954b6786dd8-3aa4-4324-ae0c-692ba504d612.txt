Letter to Ambassador Loy W. Henderson on His Contribution to the Settlement of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Dispute.
[Released August 7, 1954. Dated August 4, 1954]
Dear Mr. Ambassador:
I want you to know that I personally appreciate the splendid results of your work on the oil problem in Iran. Your knowledge of the situation, your resourcefulness, your judgment and your tireless patience in the face of repeated frustration contributed greatly to the happy arrangements which have now been worked out.
The present solution of the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute, for which you deserve such a large share of the credit, is a major achievement which will not only further our objectives in the Middle East but also contribute to our good relations with our European allies and our friends in other parts of the world as well.
I am most grateful to you for this successful effort on behalf of the Government and people of the United States.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
