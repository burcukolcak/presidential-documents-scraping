Message to Prime Minister Houphouet- Boigny on the Occasion of the Independence of the Republic of the Ivory Coast.
Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
On the occasion of the independence of the Republic of the Ivory Coast, I extend in my own name and on behalf of the United States most cordial greetings and felicitations to you and the people of the Ivory Coast.
The independence of the Ivory Coast is a source of deep satisfaction to the United States, particularly since this freedom was achieved in friendly cooperation with France. We shall follow with keen interest as the newly independent Ivory Coast takes its important place in the community of nations.
I recall with great pleasure our frank and thorough conversation during your visit to Washington last November. Your clear exposition of problems in Africa was of the highest interest to me.
On this historic occasion the Government and people of the United States look forward to close and friendly relations with the Government and people of the Ivory Coast.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
