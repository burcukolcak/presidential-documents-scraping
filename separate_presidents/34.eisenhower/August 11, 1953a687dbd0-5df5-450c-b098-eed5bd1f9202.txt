Letter to Heads of Departments and Agencies Concerning Further Economies in Government.
[Released August 11, 1953. Dated August 6, 1953]
- Dear_________:
Ever since the date of Inauguration, every member of this Administration has been dedicated to the purposes of efficiency and economy in government. Now that Congress is adjourned, it is time to attack the problem with renewed vigor. It is absolutely essential that you begin immediately to take every possible step progressively to reduce the expenditures of your department during the fiscal year 1954. In addition to this action, you will be expected to make substantial reductions in your requests for new appropriations and in the level of your expenditures for the fiscal year 1955, beyond those already indicated for the fiscal year 1954.
It is imperative that you emphasize a critical review and maximum feasible reductions of expenditures in areas which have attracted the attention and concern of the Congress and of the public as possible sources of waste, inefficiency, duplication, and excessive or nonessential costs.
Every level of the staff of your Department should be made aware of the necessity for doing this and of the importance of their cooperation as a vital part of its accomplishment.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
