Statement by the President on the Death of Ambassador John E. Peurifoy and His Son
I HAVE just been informed of the tragic death of Ambassador John E. Peurifoy and his son. A brilliant career diplomat, Ambassador Peurifoy served his country exceptionally well for many years. The United States and the free world has lost an outstanding champion of freedom and peace.
On the personal side, Mrs. Eisenhower and I have lost a valued friend. We extend our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Peurifoy in the great loss she has sustained.
Note: Mr. Peurifoy was serving as Ambassador to Thailand at the time of his death in an automobile accident.
