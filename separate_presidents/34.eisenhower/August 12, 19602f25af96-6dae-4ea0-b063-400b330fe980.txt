Dwight D. Eisenhower
August 12, 1960

Message Recorded for Transmission Via Communication Satellite Echo I.
THIS IS President Eisenhower speaking.
It is a great personal satisfaction to participate in this first experiment in communications involving the use of a satellite balloon known as Echo. This is one more significant step in the United States program of space research and exploration. The program is being carried forward vigorously by the United States for peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.
The satellite balloon which has reflected these words may be used freely by any nation for similar experiments in its own interests. Information necessary to prepare for such participation was widely distributed some weeks ago.
The United States will continue to make freely available to the world the scientific information acquired from this and other experiments in its program of space exploration.
Note: The message was transmitted from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory station at Goldstone, Calif., as Echo I was completing its first orbit, and was relayed by the satellite to the Bell Telephone Laboratories station in Holmdel, N.J.
