Proclamation 3255—Restoration of Trade Agreement Concession and Reduced Rate of Duty with Respect to Hatters' Fur—Termination of Proclamation No. 2960

1.Whereas, pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 (a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U. S. C. 1351), the President, on October 30, 1947, entered into a trade agreement with certain foreign countries, which consists of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the related Protocol of Provisional Application thereof, together with the Final Act Adopted at the Conclusion of the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment (81 Stat. (Parts 5 and 6) A 7, A 11, and A 2050), and by Proclamation No. 2761A of December 16, 1947 (3 CFR, 1943-1958 2 Comp., p. 139), proclaimed such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States and such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out such trade agreement on and after January 1, 1948;
2.Whereasitem 1520 in Part I of Schedule XX (Geneva-1947) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade read as follows:
3.Whereas, after investigation and report to the President by the United States Tariff Commission pursuant to section 7 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 (19 U. S. C. 1364), the President by Proclamation No. 2960 of January 5, 1952 (3 CFR, 1952 Supp., p. 18), invoked Article XIX of the General Agreement and modified the tariff concession therein with respect to the products described in the said item 1520 by substituting for the rate "15% ad val." the rate "471/20 Per lb., but not less than 15% nor more than 35% ad val.", effective February 9, 1952;
4.Whereas, pursuant to Proclamation No. 2960, since February 9, 1952, the products described in item 1520 have been subject to the rate of duty of 471/2 cents per pound, but not less than 15 per cent nor more than 35 per cent ad valorem; and
5.Whereas, after investigation, including a hearing, pursuant to paragraph 2 of Executive Order No. 10401 of October 14, 1952 (3 CFR, 1952 Supp., p. 105), the United States Tariff Commission has reported to me its finding that the modification of the concession as set forth in the third recital of this proclamation by Proclamation No. 2960 no longer remains necessary in order to prevent or remedy serious injury or the threat thereof to the domestic industry producing products like or directly competitive with the products described in item 1520 and has recommended that the original concession, as set forth in the second recital of this proclamation, be restored in full:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and in accordance with the provisions of section 7 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, as amended, and of Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, do hereby terminate the said Proclamation No. 2960, effective at the close of business September 13, 1958, to the end that item as originally set forth in Part I of Schedule XX (Geneva-1947) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade shall thereafter be applied in accordance with the provisions of the said Proclamation No. 2761A of December 16, 1947.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this fourteenth day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
