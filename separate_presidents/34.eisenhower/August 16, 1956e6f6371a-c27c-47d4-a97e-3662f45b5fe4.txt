August 16, 1956

Statement by the President in Response to a Progress Report on Highways by the Secretary of Commerce.
I HAVE RECEIVED a progress report on highways from Sinclair Weeks, Secretary of Commerce.
I am pleased to learn that general programming of Interstate System projects since the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 became law now exceeds $800 million.
The States have already been authorized to proceed with advertising for bids on Interstate System projects costing over $36 million since the new highway legislation was approved on June 29.
One State, Missouri, has already awarded contracts totaling nearly $4 million for Interstate System improvements, utilizing both old and new funds available.
I am gratified to observe the initial speed with which this important program is developing. I am hopeful that the States will continue to move swiftly in advancing final project applications for construction. Prompt State action will help alleviate the great deficiencies in our highway systems and will convert the Federal fund authorizations into usable roads at the earliest possible time.
Note: Secretary Weeks' report, released with the foregoing statement, also informed the President that standards for improvement of the Interstate System were adopted by the State highway departments only 13 days after approval of the 1956 act. He added that these standards had been approved by the Bureau of Public Roads for application to all Interstate System improvements, The report is in the form of a letter dated August 9, 1956.
