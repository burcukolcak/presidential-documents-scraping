Statement by the President Upon Signing the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Act.
I AM HIGHLY GRATIFIED by this new law which makes group life insurance available to Federal employees.
The economic security of an employee's family contributes directly and powerfully to his effectiveness as a worker. Group life insurance has therefore become an important factor in private industry's employer-employee relations. Enactment of this new law is a milestone in the effort to adapt to Federal personnel management the best practices of progressive private employers.
The Civil Service Commission will see that appropriate information is distributed promptly to all Federal employees, so that they will have the benefit of this insurance protection at the earliest possible date.
Note: The Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Act of 1954 is Public Law 598, 83d Congress (68 Stat. 736).
