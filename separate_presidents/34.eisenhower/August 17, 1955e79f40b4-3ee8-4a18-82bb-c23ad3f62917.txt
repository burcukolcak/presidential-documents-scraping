Presidential Statement Upon Signing Order Prescribing a Code of Conduct for Members of the Armed Forces While in Combat or Captivity.
NO AMERICAN prisoner of war will be forgotten by the United States. Every available means will be employed by our government to establish contact with, to support and to obtain the release of all our prisoners of war. Furthermore, the laws of the United States provide for the support and care of dependents of members of the armed forces including those who become prisoners of war. I assure dependents of such prisoners that these laws will continue to provide for their welfare.
Note: The Code of Conduct was issued as part of Executive Order 10631 (3 CFR, 1955 Supp.). The White House release containing the President's statement noted that the order initiated a positive program to fortify military personnel against techniques and devices used on United States prisoners of war.
The release also stated that the President expressed gratification concerning studies and recommendations made by the Secretary of Defense's Advisory Committee on Prisoners of War. The Committee's report, entitled "POW" (Government Printing Office, 1955), was released by the Department of Defense.
This statement was released at Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Colo.
