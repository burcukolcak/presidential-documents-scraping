Message to Madame de Gasperi on the Death of the Prime Minister of Italy.
I HAVE BEEN profoundly moved to learn of the death of your husband. From my long, close and friendly association with him, I know how much the world owes to him for his courageous contribution to the defense of civilization, his devotion to democracy and his dedication to the cause of European integration. He was one of the truly great men of his time and provided an inspiration not only for Italy but for the world that I hope will find reflection in future action. Mrs. Eisenhower and I wish to convey to you our heartfelt sympathy and that of the American people in your loss.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
