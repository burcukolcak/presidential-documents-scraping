Remarks on the Communist Control Act of 1954.
[Recorded on film]
I HAVE just signed a bill which is designed to place into the hands of our law enforcement agencies, particularly the Attorney General and the FBI, better weapons for combatting the Communist menace in this country. This is one of a series of bills that are designed in this general purpose.
The American people are determined to eliminate from their midst organizations which, purporting to be political parties in the accepted sense of that term, are actually conspirators dedicated to the destruction of our form of government by violence and force.
Now they also are determined to do this by means that are fair, just and in accordance with our Constitution. They well realize that to do it in any other way could affect the innocent adversely as well as the guilty, and could in the long run distort and damage our entire judicial procedures. All of these bills are designed in that spirit and with those purposes.
