Letter to Edgar Eisenhower Concerning the Dedication of Mt. Eisenhower in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada.
[ Released August 24, 1958. Dated August 19, 1958 ]
Dear Edgar:
I regret very much that prior commitments prevent my being with you in Banff National Park for the dedication of Mount Eisenhower. Please give my personal greetings to everyone gathered there. I know this will be a happy moment in the long and friendly association of the peoples of Canada and the United States.
In 1946, when the Canadian Government chose our family name for this mountain, World War II was only a few months past and the distinguished record of the Canadian troops in Europe was fresh in my mind. I had the feeling then, and still do, that the mountain's name commemorated the victory of our allied forces which was, of course, the victory of many men working together. So for me, this splendid mountain recalls the valor and determination of the Canadian first Army-and indeed of all those dedicated people who served the cause of freedom.
I hope you will thank the members of Kiwanis International, and particularly the Kiwanis Clubs of the Western Canada District, for their thoughtfulness and generosity in arranging these dedication ceremonies. Congratulations to them for helping to advance the spirit of friendship which gives hope and strength to the building of peace.

Best wishes to all.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: This letter was read at the ceremony by Edgar Eisenhower, the President's older brother.
