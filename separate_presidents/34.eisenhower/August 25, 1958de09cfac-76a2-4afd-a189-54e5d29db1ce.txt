Dear Bill:
You will be leaving shortly to return to California, there to wage a political campaign on behalf of a philosophy of government in which we both believe.
Before you go, I want to tell you how grateful I am for your tireless efforts as Senate Majority Leader and then as Senate Minority Leader. In both of these capacities you demonstrated the characteristics of leadership, of integrity, and devotion in the service of the Nation.
The people of this country owe you a debt of gratitude for your contribution to good government and for helping maintain peace in the world. I am certain that the people of California are aware of your admirable qualifications, fine character, and dedication to duty, and would want to utilize your services as Governor of that great State.
I am well aware of the political sacrifice that you have made in continuing to discharge your responsibilities so faithfully during the past several weeks. for this I am especially grateful.
You take with you my best wishes and those of Mrs. Eisenhower for a successful campaign, and our affection for both you and Helen.

With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
