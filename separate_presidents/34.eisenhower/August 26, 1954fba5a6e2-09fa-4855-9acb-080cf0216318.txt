Letter to Secretary Mitchell Establishing an Interdepartmental Committee on Migratory Labor.
Dear Mr. Secretary:
It is very reassuring that Congressional approval of the Administration's recommendation for new funds for the Department of Labor will enable you to assume leadership in improving the social and economic welfare of our domestic migratory farm workers. A coordinated Federal approach and a full utilization of existing resources will make possible more effective action in the solution of migratory labor problems.
As you have suggested, I am establishing an Interdepartmental Committee on Migratory Labor made up of the Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, Labor, and Health, Education, and Welfare and the Administrator of the Housing and Home Finance Agency. I am designating you as Chairman. In addition, there are other departments and agencies which have major interests in specific areas, and I shall expect you, as Chairman, to keep them informed and to invite their participation as needed.
It is my hope that this Committee will aid the various Federal agencies in mobilizing and stimulating more effective programs and services for migrants and in providing service to State and local areas through their constituent members. I believe this Committee can be of great help in developing cooperative relationships between the Federal agencies and the State agencies concerned with these problems.
I shall look forward to having periodic reports from you concerning the progress and recommendations of the Committee.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
