I also request urban groups to join in this observance along with farm groups, as evidence of America's appreciation of all those on the farms and in the cities who provide us with our daily bread and other necessities of life.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
