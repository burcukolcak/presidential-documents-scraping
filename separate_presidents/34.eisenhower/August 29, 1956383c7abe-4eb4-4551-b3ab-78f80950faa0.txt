Statement by the President Following Receipt of Secretary Dulles' Report on the London Suez Conference.
I HAVE JUST RECEIVED from Secretary Dulles a full report upon the London Suez Conference. This supplements the daily messages which I received from him while he was in London.
It is, I think, of great significance that 18 of the 22 nations assembled in London, the shipping of which represents over 95% of the traffic through the Suez Canal, have agreed upon conditions which in their opinion are indispensable to give confidence that this waterway internationalized by the Treaty of 1888 will be operated so as dependably to serve its appointed purpose.
I am glad that President Nasser is prepared to meet to discuss this program.
This program was conceived in an atmosphere of friendly conciliation and, in my opinion, ought to rally behind it the support of all the nations and peoples that believe in the processes of international justice and conciliation.
The United States Government and, I believe, the American nation completely support the is-nation proposal thus arrived at in London, which, fully respecting the sovereignty of Egypt, would assure a peaceful solution of this great problem.
Note: Secretary Dulles reported to the president in person. The text of proposals approved by the 18 nations is published in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 35, P. 373).
