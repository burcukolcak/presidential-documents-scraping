Dwight D. Eisenhower
August 29, 1960

Letter to Judge E. Barrett Prettyman Requesting Him To Serve as Chairman of the President's Conference on Administrative Procedure.
Dear Judge Prettyman:
The Chairmen of six of the independent regulatory agencies of the federal government, in a letter to me dated August 25, 1960, a copy of which is enclosed, have proposed that there be a new President's Conference looking to a continuation of the study of administrative problems such as was achieved under the President's Conference on Administrative Procedure in 1953-54 under your leadership. I have concurred in their proposal.
I have also received from the Chief Justice a strong recommendation for such a Conference and the endorsement of the Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia, the American Bar Association and the federal Bar Association. It would appear that the Conference would be advisory, provide for the exchange of information and experience, and make such suggestions as might reasonably improve agency procedure.
The suggestion, which I heartily approve, has been made that you act as Temporary Chairman of the Conference and arrange for its initial organization. I earnestly hope that you will be willing to do so.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Judge Prettyman was serving as Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
The letter from the Chairmen of the six regulatory agencies was released with the President's letter to Judge Prettyman.
