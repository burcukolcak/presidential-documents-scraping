Letter to the Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, Concerning Establishment of an Ernest Orlando Lawrence Memorial Award.
[ Released August 30, 1958. Dated August 19, 1958 ]
Dear John:
I strongly agree that the memory of Dr. Lawrence, as well as his great contributions, should be commemorated. To that end, I request that you initiate action to establish a memorial award beating his name, for especially meritorious contributions in the broad field of atomic endeavor.
Such an award would seem to me to be most fitting both as a recognition of what he has given to our country and to mankind, and as a means of helping to carry forward his work through inspiring others to dedicate their lives and talents to scientific effort.

With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Chairman John A. McCone's letter of August 28, proposing the establishment of the memorial award, was released with the President's reply at the U. S. Naval Base, Newport, R.I.
