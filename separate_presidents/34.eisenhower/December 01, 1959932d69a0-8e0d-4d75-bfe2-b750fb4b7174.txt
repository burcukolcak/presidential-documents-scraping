CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF MEDAL OF FREEDOM
TO
NEIL MCELROY
FOR EXCEPTIONALLY MERITORIOUS

SERVICE AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE

SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES
As Secretary of Defense from October 9, 1957, to December 1, 1959, Neil Hosler McElroy has held a major responsibility both for maintaining our armed forces as an effective deterrent to war during a period of far-reaching change in military technology and for strengthening collective security throughout the Free World by assisting friendly countries in their efforts to protect themselves against aggression. With outstanding success he has carded out these difficult assignments.
Under his leadership, the armed forces effected an orderly introduction of many new weapons systems and expedited military research efforts essential to the security of our country in the years ahead. His experience in administering large organizations greatly contributed to the effective adjustment of our military organization to current needs, both at home and abroad. In negotiations with allied nations, he has further strengthened the bonds of friendship between them and the United States.
In recognition of his outstanding service to his country and his dedication to his task, I take great pleasure in presenting the Medal of Freedom to Neil Hosler McElroy.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The presentation was made by the President at a ceremony held in the Cabinet Room following a meeting of the National Security Council.
