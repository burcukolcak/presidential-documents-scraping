Remarks Upon Arrival at Esenboga Airport, Ankara.
Mr. President, Citizens of Turkey:
President Bayar, from my heart I thank you and your people for your welcome for my party and myself.
Almost 8 years have passed since my last visit to Ankara. In those years the bonds of friendship and partnership between the Turkish and American peoples have grown stronger. So I return to the capital of this sister republic, hopeful that my visit here will be fruitful for the good of both nations.
My purpose in returning to Turkey is twofold: first, I have wanted to take advantage of a long-standing invitation to visit this nation once again and see all the developments that have taken place since I was here in the spring of 1952.
Second, in my official capacity as President of the United States, I return the visit which you, President Bayar, so graciously paid America.
This visit will permit me to discuss with the leaders of your government some of the problems that confront free nations today. We shall take also the opportunity to talk about opportunities that present themselves to achieve a world of plenty in which all nations can live--independent and prosperous, at peace with their neighbors. I want you to know that we in America greatly respect and highly regard our staunch friend and ally, Turkey. We know that you will be strong and persistent and dedicated in all efforts for peace and friendship in freedom.
President Bayar, I am delighted to be here once again among my Turkish friends, and I know that I speak for all the members of my party when I respond to your warm words of welcome by saying, somewhat haltingly I fear, but nevertheless sincerely, "Hos bulduk. Cok tesekkur ederim" [We are happy to be here. I thank you very much].
Note: The President spoke at 3:15 p.m. He was met by President Bayar, Turkish civilian and military officials, members of the diplomatic corps, and by U.S. Ambassador Fletcher Warren.
