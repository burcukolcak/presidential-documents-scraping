Remarks Upon Arrival at Mauripur Airport, Karachi.
Mr. President:
I am more than grateful for the words of welcome you have just uttered, and I am particularly pleased by the sentiments you expressed about the ambitions of your country, a new country developing itself to be a force for good and for peace in the world.
For myself, may I say that I have just realized a long-felt ambition to come to your country of Pakistan, knowing something of its history and its traditions and to visit your leaders, your people, and your countryside.
This ambition has been all the stronger in recent years since Pakistan has been an ally of ours. We want to work together for peace, for our own mutual security, but from that position of strength and security to work always for what is good, decent, and just. Believing in our God, believing in the convictions that we have inherited from our Forefathers, we will yet have a world in which a just peace will be the lot of men, in which they can realize and use the fruits of their own toil.
I assure you again, Mr. President, that my party and I are looking forward to this visit with the greatest of anticipation, and we know before we leave that we are not going to be disappointed.
Thank you a lot.
Note: The President was met by President Ayub, members of President Ayub's cabinet, military officers, members of the diplomatic corps, and U.S. Ambassador William Rountree.
