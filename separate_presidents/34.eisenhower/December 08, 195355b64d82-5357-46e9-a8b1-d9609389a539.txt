Statement by the President Concerning the United States Program for Assisting Escapees and Refugees.
I BELIEVE that the task of caring for the escapees should have the highest emphasis in the minds of all the free world, and I am happy that the United States has already done so much of this work. It is the unswerving aim of the United States that the burden of arms, the fear of oppression, and the need of flight shall, some day, be lifted from mankind in order that there may no longer be refugees or escapees, and that all may live in peace and freedom.
Note: The release of which this statement was a part announced that the program for escapees, begun in the spring of 1952, would continue under a $9 million authorization by the President from mutual security funds. The release added that the program was under the direction of the Foreign Operations Administration, that more than 6,000 escapees had already been resettled, primarily in Canada, Australia, South America, and the United States, and that the program operated in the Far East, as well as in Western Europe, aiding refugees from Communist China.
