[ Released December 8, 1956. Dated December 6, 1956 ]
Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments and Establishments:
Subject: Hungarian Refugees
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by Section 401 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, it is hereby determined that the use of funds, available under said Act, for the purpose of carrying out the program of asylum for refugees from Hungary which was announced by my statement of December 1, 1956, is important to the security of the United States and that assistance to such refugees will contribute to the security of the United States.
The Department of State, the Department of Defense, the International Cooperation Administration, and any other Executive Agencies which may participate in this program are authorized and directed to take such action and make such expenditures as may be necessary to perform such services and carry out such activities as are requested by my Representative for Hungarian Refugee Relief, and to be reimbursed from funds available under said Section for additional costs incurred and not otherwise provided for, to the extent agreed upon between such Agencies and ICA and approved by the Director of the Bureau of the Budget. It is my desire that the program be carried out forthwith and without awaiting completion of arrangements for reimbursements.
The Director of the International Cooperation Administration is requested on my behalf to give appropriate notices, pursuant to Section 513 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, the Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the respective Chairmen of the Senate and House Committees on Armed Services.
