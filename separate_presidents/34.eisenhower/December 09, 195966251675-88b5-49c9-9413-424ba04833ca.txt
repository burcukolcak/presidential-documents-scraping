Remarks to the American Community in Kabul.
FELLOW AMERICANS, youngsters, I wish I could start at one end, say "Hello," give my greetings to each one of you, and shake hands with you; but it's just impossible. I do want you to know that the Government of the United States expects a lot of you people, every one of you here. Whether you are 3 or 103, you are Mr. and Mrs. Ambassador. You are trying to picture America in another country. But more than that, you are trying to learn more about another country so you can tell us better how we should conduct ourselves to help bring peace to the earth. No one could have a more important job, and I congratulate every one of you, who has this opportunity. I want to say that so far as I can see in every Embassy that I visited every one of you is doing a good job. I thank you both for the American people and for myself.
Good luck to all of you. Goodbye.
Note: The President greeted the members of the American community at the Bagram Airport before his departure for New Delhi.
