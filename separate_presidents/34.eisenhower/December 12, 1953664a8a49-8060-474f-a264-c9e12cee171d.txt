Letter to Dr. Joseph J. Eller, Executive Director, Pan American Medical Association.
Dear Dr. Eller:
It was indeed a pleasure for me today to meet with the distinguished physicians representing the Pan American Medical Association, and I am happy to send my warm greetings to the members who will participate in the forthcoming Ninth Inter-American Medical Cruise Congress to be held this January aboard the S.S. "Nieuw Amsterdam" and in Caracas, Venezuela; Ciudad Trujillo, Dominican Republic; St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; San Juan, Puerto Rico and Havana, Cuba.
I am profoundly interested in the expansion of the Association's scholarship program, to the end that the level of professional skill may be raised. Moreover, the program you have pursued during the past twenty-six years of interchanging medical knowledge and friendship among the doctors of this hemisphere and which carries out your credo, "The practice of medicine has no national, racial or religious boundaries," certainly promotes understanding and cooperation among the American nations.
You and your colleagues in the Pan American Medical Association may be assured of my support in these endeavors.
Sincerely yours,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
