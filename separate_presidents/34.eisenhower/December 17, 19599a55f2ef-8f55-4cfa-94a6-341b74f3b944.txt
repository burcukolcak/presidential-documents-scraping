Remarks Upon Arrival at La Marsa, Tunisia
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
It is indeed a great honor for me to arrive this morning to greet again you, in your person, President Bourguiba, and to greet the people of free Tunisia.
Our country, America, has welcomed warmly this new nation into the family of independent nations. We wish you good luck in all your endeavors. We hope that we, not only working among ourselves--yourselves, ourselves, and the other free nations--may be able to produce peace with justice in this world, but that as we do it, we can find the opportunities and methods by which all people may be able to raise their own standards, to realize more the happiness that God has meant them to have, and in doing so lead our countries to a nobler, better destiny than ever before they have achieved.
So, sir, in the talks I hope to have with you this morning, and that we have planned, I hope that we can talk over some of the ways in which this cooperation between your country and mine may be as close and as fruitful as our common friendship should promise for it.
Thank you very much.
Note: The President, accompanied by Robert O. Blake, First Secretary, U.S. Embassy in Tunis, went by helicopter from the U.S.S.
