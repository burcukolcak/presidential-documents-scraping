Statement by the President on the Death of the Last Surviving Veteran of the War Between the States.
WITH MILLIONS of Americans throughout our land, I pause in respectful silence to honor the passing of the last surviving veteran of the War Between the States, Walter W. Williams.
The wounds of the deep and bitter dispute which once divided our nation have long since healed, and a united America in a divided world now holds up on a larger canvas the cherished traditions of liberty and justice for all.
With Mr. Williams' passing, the hosts of Blue and Gray who were the chief actors in that great and tragic drama a century ago have all passed from the world stage. No longer are they the Blue and the Gray. All rest together as Americans in honored glory. An era has ended.
Note: This statement was released in Washington. In addition, the President issued Proclamation 3329 (24 F.R. 10711) directing that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff on all Government buildings, grounds, and naval vessels until interment.
