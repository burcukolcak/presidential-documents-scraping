Memorandum on the Red Cross Campaign.
To the Heads of Executive Departments, Commissions and Agencies:
In peace and war, at home and abroad, the work of the American Red Cross symbolizes American courage and compassion. Through its blood program for civilians and the armed forces, services for American troops in foreign countries, relief work after flood, fire and hurricane, safety and nursing services--in these and many other ways this organization tirelessly serves human need.
That this work may continue, I know all Federal employees will want to join with their fellow-citizens in supporting the 1955 Red Cross Fund Campaign. I have asked the Honorable Sinclair Weeks, Secretary of Commerce, to act as the Chairman of the Government Unit. I urge you personally to consult with him and to request all officials and employees of your department, in Washington and the field, to cooperate with their respective local chapters and to form an organization adequate to raise the amount desired from your department.
If each of us does his full share, this great humanitarian program will be a brilliant success.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
