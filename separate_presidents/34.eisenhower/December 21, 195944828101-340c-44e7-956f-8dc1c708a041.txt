Toast by the President at the Dinner Given in His Honor by General Franco
I am delighted to be here tonight.
Your words of welcome, General Franco, the heartwarming, friendly reception of the Spanish people; the congeniality of this gathering--are all evidence of Spain's traditional hospitality and courtesy.
As you have said, General, the friendship between the Spanish and American peoples has its roots deep in the history of our two nations. In the very beginnings of the Republic of the United States, the help of Spain and the Spanish people was of great importance to us.
Today, this friendship needs only the nourishment of continuing close relations--in understanding, in trust, in joined effort--to enable us constantly to increase our mutual contribution to peace and friendship in freedom.
Neither Spain nor the United States seeks to exploit other peoples. Neither plots an aggression against any neighbor, near or far. Neither is impelled by an atheistic philosophy to degrade human beings into economic tools of the state.
Rather, both Spain and the United States want to live at peace, at honorable peace, with all their neighbors in the world community. Both want to use their resources for the betterment of their people and to help, so far as they can, in the betterment of all humanity. Both want freedom for themselves and for all nations.
And at this season, when both Spain and the United States celebrate the birth of the Savior, both peoples re-dedicate themselves to the message which heralded His coming: Peace on Earth to Men of Good Will. In the spirit of this Christmas season, in the message of two thousand years ago, we seek divine blessing on today's purpose of Peace and Friendship in Freedom.
General Franco, to you and to the people of Spain, to a fruitful friendship linking our countries.
