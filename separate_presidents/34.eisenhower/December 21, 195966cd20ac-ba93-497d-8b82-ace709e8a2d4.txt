Joint Statement Concerning the Economic Agreements Reached at the Western Summit Conference.
THE HEADS of State and Government have discussed the important changes that have taken place in the international economic situation. Recognizing the great economic progress of Western Europe, they have agreed that virtually all of the industrialized part of the free world is now in a position to devote its energies in increased measure to new and important tasks of cooperative endeavor with the object of:
(a) furthering the development of the less developed countries, and
(b) pursuing trade policies directed to the sound use of economic resources and the maintenance of harmonious international relations, thus contributing to growth and stability in the world economy and to a general improvement in the standard of living.
In their view these cooperative principles should also govern the discussions on commercial problems arising from the existence of European economic regional organizations, which are or will be constituted within the framework of the GATT, such as the European Economic Community and the European Free Trade Association. Their relations both with other countries and with each other should be discussed in this spirit.
The Heads of State and Government, recognizing that the method of furthering these principles requires intensive study, have agreed to call an informal meeting to be held in Paris in the near future. They suggest that the members and participants of the Executive Committee of the OEEC and the Governments whose nationals are members of the Steering Board for Trade of the OEEC should be represented at this meeting.
It is proposed that an objective of such a group should be to consider the need for and methods of continuing consultations dealing with the above-mentioned problems.
