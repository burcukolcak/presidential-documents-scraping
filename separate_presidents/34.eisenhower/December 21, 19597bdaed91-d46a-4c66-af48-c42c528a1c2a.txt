Letter to Chairman Khrushchev Proposing a Four-Power Summit Conference in Paris.
Dear Mr. Chairman:
As you are aware I have just met with President de Gaulle and Prime Minister Macmillan. Among the subjects we discussed was the possibility of our having a meeting with you to consider international questions of mutual concern.
We agreed that it would be desirable for the four Heads of State or Government to meet together from time to time in each other's countries to discuss the main problems affecting the attainment of peace and stability in the world. I therefore wish now to express my readiness to meet with you, President de Gaulle and Prime Minister Macmillan at the earliest feasible time. In view of the engagements of all of us, as they are known to me, we had thought that the opening date for the proposed conference could be April 27 and that Paris would be the most appropriate place for the first meeting.
I very much hope that this proposal is acceptable to you.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
