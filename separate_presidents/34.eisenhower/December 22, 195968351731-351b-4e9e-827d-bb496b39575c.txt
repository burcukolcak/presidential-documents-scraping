Dwight D. Eisenhower
December 22, 1959

Remarks at Andrews Air Force Base Upon Returning From the Good Will Tour.
Folks:
Thank you very much indeed for coming out on this cold night to welcome my party and me back home. It is certainly good to be here.
Now I must remind you that this morning we had breakfast in Madrid, lunch in Casablanca--and now we are home at an hour which by our getting up time is five or six o'clock in the morning. So you can realize that it is not a time for a very erudite and informing speech.
But I do want to say just one thing: everywhere we went, people sent this back, a message of Merry Christmas and good will to all the people of the United States. And in that message I join myself this evening to all of you, everybody--everywhere.
Good night.
Note: The President spoke at approximately 11 p.m.
