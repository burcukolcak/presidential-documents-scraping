Joint Statement Following Discussions with Chief of State Franco.
THE PRESIDENT of the United States and the Chief of the Spanish State this morning concluded a series of conversations in which they were joined by other officials of both governments. The President reviewed the purposes which had led him to undertake his good-will tour and the results which he hoped would be achieved. He gave the Chief of State a review of his trip including the Western Summit Conference.
The talks, which covered a wide variety of other international matters of interest to both countries, were conducted in an atmosphere of cordiality and understanding. The President and the Chief of State discussed the President's planned visit to the Soviet Union next year and confirmed their views, as expressed in their exchange of letters of last August, that such consultations to improve the climate of relationships would be beneficial, although a firm defense posture should be maintained.
Gratifying progress was noted in the implementation of the economic and defense agreements signed by the United States and Spain on September 96, 1953. These agreements are based on a recognition of the necessity for efforts on the part of both countries to achieve the common goal of world peace and stability.
During these conversations Spain's admission to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation was mentioned with satisfaction and the President expressed his good wishes for the success of the Spanish economic stabilization program.
The conversation served as another indication of the friendly ties between the Spanish and American peoples and strengthened the bonds of cooperation that exist between the two countries.
