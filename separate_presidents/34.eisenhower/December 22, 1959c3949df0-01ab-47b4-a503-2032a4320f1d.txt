Remarks at Torrejon Air Force Base, Madrid, Upon Leaving for Morocco
Generalissimo, Your Excellencies, and Ladies and Gentlemen:
The only regret that I have about this visit that I have made to this beautiful country is its shortness. I should like to have stayed here as many days as I have hours. But in spite of the shortness of that time, I am going back with very vivid impressions.
While the courtesy and hospitality of the Spanish people has been proverbial and known throughout the world, one must experience it to really feel its true depth and intensity. I should like to be able to send my personal gratitude and thanks to every individual who has come to this air field to bid me welcome yesterday, or goodbye today--to every individual who came along the street to shout "eekay," which I understand is Spanish for my nickname.
It has been a fruitful visit. I have had useful discussions with the Generalissimo and with the members of his government, and I am quite sure that the traditional ties of friendship and the active cooperation which has been progressing between our countries will be stronger because of this visit.
And finally, I should like on behalf of the American people to bring you their wishes, whether you are here as an American on this base or to all the Spanish people wherever my voice can reach. Best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. And indeed, after some of the expressions I heard along the street yesterday, I feel that I have your permission to take your best wishes to them for the same kind of fine holiday season.
Goodbye--my appreciation to every official, to every individual that I have had the pleasure of seeing--and good luck to all of you. May God keep you. Goodbye.
Note: The President and General Franco went by helicopter to the airport following their breakfast discussion at Pardo Palace.
