Statement by the President on Highway Safety During the Holidays.
FOR HUNDREDS of American families the Christmas week end this year was a time of sorrow that cannot be measured in statistics or casualty lists. The families broken up, the homes darkened, the anguish and the heartbreak of children and the aged--these terrible penalties of speeding or careless and reckless driving cast a tragic shadow on this Christmastide.
The New Year's week end, too, will inflict on hundreds more an equally tragic toll, unless all of us as we drive about the country observe the rules of the road, a decent regard for the safety of ourselves and others, and a courtesy that reflects our respect for the life and welfare of our neighbors. We can make this the safest New Year's week end on record, if we want to.
And certainly after listening to and reading, through the Christmas days, the reports of mounting death and injury on our highways, all of us should be determined to save lives this week end.
