Whereasthe American National Red Cross, acting under congressional charter, provides welfare services to the armed forces, veterans, and their families, and ministers to the needs of disaster victims both at home and abroad; and
Whereas, through its first aid and safety services, blood program, nursing program, youth programs, and other community services, the Red Cross contributes to the general health and welfare of the American people; and
Whereas, by helping to promote cooperative action among the eighty-four national Red Cross societies comprising the League of Red Cross Societies, the American Red Cross is a major instrument for strengthening the bonds of humanitarian service among the peoples of the world; and

Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate March 1960 as Red Cross Month; and I urge all Americans to support the Red Cross as an instrument of their charitable concern for their neighbors in need.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this fifth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
