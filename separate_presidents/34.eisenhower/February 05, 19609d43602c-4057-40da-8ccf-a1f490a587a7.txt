Memorandum Directing the Special Assistant for Personnel Management To Provide Leadership in the Career Executive Development Program.
Memorandum for the Special Assistant to the President for Personnel Management:
As you know, the government faces a continuing loss each year of some of the executives filling the top career management positions.
To meet this problem, we must be assured a continuing supply of well-trained career employees to replace those leaving the service. The military services, of course, have well-developed programs for the replacement of top officers going out of the service. I understand the civilian services generally have none.
While I fully realize that the same requirements and conditions do not apply with equal force to the military and civilian services of government, both must have an adequate and continuing supply of well-trained and competent leaders and managers if they are to meet the demands of today's world.
Career men and women are the backbone of any organization. Without able career managers, government, in particular, cannot function effectively and efficiently.
I am most anxious that we, in this Administration, do our utmost to see to it that the government has a sound program for the selection, development and training of its career civil servants.
Therefore, as my Special Assistant for Personnel Management, you will take the leadership in the development of a government-wide program to meet this objective. With respect to positions in the competitive Civil Service, you will, of course, cooperate with and depend upon the Civil Service Commission. In regard to other personnel systems, you will cooperate with the heads of the agencies concerned.
All department and agency heads are being advised of my concern in this matter.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
