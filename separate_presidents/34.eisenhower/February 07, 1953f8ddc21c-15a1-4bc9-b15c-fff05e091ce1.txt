Message to the Boy Scouts of America on Their 43d Anniversary.
[Released February 7, 1953. Dated February 4, 1953]
To the Boy Scouts of America:

It is with great personal pleasure that I extend to you my warmest congratulations on your Forty-third Anniversary and greet you on the occasion of Boy Scout Week 1953.
Your present crusade "Forward on Liberty's Team" is proving to be most effective. Americans everywhere must be proud to know that the Boy Scouts of America registered its three-millionth active member during the past year. I understand that the present membership has now reached a new high of 3,200,000 Scouts, Explorers, and leaders, and that since 1910 there have been 20,200,000 American boys and men enrolled.
This birthday message is addressed to every Scout and leader in the Boy Scouts of America. I urge you all to live up to the high ideals for which Scouting stands--your duty as patriotic citizens. If you will follow the Scout oath, America will be better able to meet its full responsibility in cooperation with other nations in maintaining peace on earth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
