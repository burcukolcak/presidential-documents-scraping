Memorandum Regarding the 1957 Red Cross Campaign.
[ Released February 7, 1957. Dated February 6, 1957 ]
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
Because of its humanitarian purposes, the American Red Cross is close to the hearts of all who are concerned with the welfare of others. Federal employees and military personnel have demonstrated this fact through their splendid record of contributions to the Red Cross.
The need for our generous support of imperative Red Cross services continues. The past year has been a busy and costly one. Disaster expenditures alone were the highest in seventy-five years, and for several months the organization has been engaged in extensive relief operations on behalf of the people of Hungary. The Red Cross must always be kept ready to assume its responsibilities to victims of disaster, to the armed forces, to veterans, and their families, as well as through its safety services, nursing and national blood programs, community and international services.
The 1957 Red Cross Campaign will be conducted during the month of March in accordance with the approved Federal fund-raising policy and program which specifically provides a separate solicitation period for the American National Red Cross in all communities, except those where the Red Cross participates in a local united campaign, as well as among military and civilian personnel overseas. It is my desire that officials and employees throughout the Federal establishment cooperate with their respective Red Cross chapters and units and extend their full support to this campaign.
I am confident of a response that will do credit to the Federal service and be an important factor in the success of the Red Cross campaign.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
