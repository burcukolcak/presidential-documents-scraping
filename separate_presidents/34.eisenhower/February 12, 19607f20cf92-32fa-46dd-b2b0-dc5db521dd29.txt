Remarks Recorded in Observance of the 50th Anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America.
My fellow citizens:
I have long been interested and active in the Boy Scouts of America, both as a member of its National Executive Board, and more recently as its Honorary President. In that capacity, I have the special privilege of calling upon our Nation to join in honoring the 50th anniversary of this great youth movement.
For half a century the men who have led this virile movement have been making a great and wise investment in time and energy voluntarily given. The dividend they have reaped has been a rich one. Today the Scouting movement counts a membership of 5 million boys and men-and women, too. Over 30 million boys have been members since its founding here in Washington just 50 years ago.
In thousands of churches, schools, meeting halls of all kinds, Scouts and their leaders are rededicating themselves to the Scout Oath. These 32 words might well serve as an appropriate guide for good citizenship at any age level-
"On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight."
The active and abiding interest of the adult citizens of this Nation is important to the furtherance of this great movement. I ask that you join with the Boy Scouts as they celebrate this anniversary by giving them that active support--by your helping your son--or another's--to become a Scout; by volunteering as an adult leader; by making available the resources needed.
Thank you very much.
