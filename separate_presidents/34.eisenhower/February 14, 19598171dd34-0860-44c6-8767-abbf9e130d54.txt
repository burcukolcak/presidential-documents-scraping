Statement by the President Following His Visit to Secretary Dulles in Walter Reed Hospital.
I HAVE just visited Secretary Dulles. We had a good talk and he is resting well. His immediate response to the hernia operation, as the doctors indicated to me, has been very satisfactory. While I was with him, his doctors discussed with us their finding of the existence of malignancy not fully determined at this time as to extent but certain to require further treatment.
I express the thoughts and prayers of all of us that the results of his operation and the further course of treatment will be successful. In order to allow time for this purpose, the Secretary continues on leave of absence. I will, of course, be in close touch with him constantly.
