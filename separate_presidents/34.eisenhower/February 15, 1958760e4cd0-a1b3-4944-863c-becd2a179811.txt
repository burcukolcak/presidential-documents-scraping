Dwight D. Eisenhower
February 15, 1958

Letter Accepting Resignation of Harold E. Stassen, Special Assistant to the President.
Dear Harold:
I deeply regret that you are leaving the Federal government, effective today, and that our five year association together in government service is to terminate. In the important posts to which you have been assigned I have been most appreciative of your sincerity of purpose, tireless energy and dedication to duty.
On the more personal side, I have valued highly your loyal friendship, as well as your readiness to express to me frankly your views on the many subjects that have been of common interest to us both.
Since the reasons you give for your decision are of a political nature and involve an intent to participate in a primary contest in Pennsylvania, I deem it inappropriate for me to comment here on them. But I am free to express my deep conviction that because of your long and varied experience in state government and in military and civil posts in the Federal government, you have much to contribute to the future of our country. Certainly your sincerity and integrity will command the respect of all citizens, no matter in what activity you may engage.
Mrs. Eisenhower joins me in best wishes for you and your family for a successful and happy future. Once more I express to you my personal gratitude for your devoted work and many valuable contributions during the past five years.

With warm personal regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The five-year association referred to by the President began on January 27, 1953, when Mr. Stassen was commissioned Director for Mutual Security. Mr. Stassen also served as Director of the Foreign Operations Administration.
Mr. Stassen's letter of February 14 and the President's reply were released at Thomasville, Ga.
