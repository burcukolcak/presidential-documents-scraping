Letter to Emil Sandstrom, League of Red Cross Societies, on Completion of the Flood Relief Program in Europe.
[Released February 19, 1955. Dated February 4, 1955]
Dear Justice Sandstrom:

The relief program for the victims of the floods which inundated parts of Central and Eastern Europe last summer is now practically completed. Over $ 10 million worth of aid has been distributed to these unfortunate people, most of it through the active cooperation of your organization.
The most notable fact about this program has been the strict adherence by everyone to the humanitarian principles of the Red Cross. Relief was given to the needy regardless of race, color, creed or political Conviction. For the first time in many years, it was possible to surmount political boundaries in the administration of relief. I know that the success of the program is in a large measure due to the untiring efforts of the members of your organization. Reports received here indicate that Red Cross officials worked long hours, including week ends and holidays, to assure the success of this program. They can be proud of their work.
I wish to express to you and through you to every member of your organization who participated in the successful accomplishment of this undertaking my sincere appreciation, as well as my congratulations.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Justice Sandstrom was Chairman of the Board of Governors of the League of Red Cross Societies, with headquarters at Geneva, Switzerland. At the time the letter was made public the White House announced that 66,551 tons of foodstuffs had been sent in 28 shiploads to areas in Central and Eastern Europe. The release further stated that the relief program began on November 10, 1954, after the Iron Curtain countries agreed to admit United States ships to their harbors for this purpose.
Justice Sandstrom's reply was released with the President's letter.
