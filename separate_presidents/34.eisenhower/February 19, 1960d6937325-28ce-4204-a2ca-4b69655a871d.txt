Dwight D. Eisenhower
February 19, 1960

Statement by the President on the Birth of a Son to Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip.
I KNOW that all Americans join with Mrs. Eisenhower and myself in congratulating Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, and Prince Philip on the birth of their new son and are delighted by the news that the Queen and her son are doing well. May the Prince have a long, happy and useful life.
