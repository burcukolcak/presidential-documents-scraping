Message to Prime Minister Menderes of Turkey on the Cyprus Agreement.
[Released February 20, 1959. Dated February 19, 1959]
Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
The conclusion of an agreement on the substance of a Cyprus settlement by Turkey, Greece, and the United Kingdom, and the representatives of the Cypriot people is indeed a splendid achievement. A high order of statesmanship and resolution was needed to construct the basis for an equitable solution of this grave problem. I want you to know how much I admire your efforts, and those of your Foreign Minister, Mr. Zorlu, in the important negotiations which preceded the agreement.
The solution owes its impetus to Turkish-Greek understanding and cooperation. It will surely strengthen the NATO alliance and indeed the entire Free World.
I know that serious obstacles stood in the way. I can appreciate, all the more, the understanding and patience which were needed to achieve this significant step.

With warm personal regard,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
