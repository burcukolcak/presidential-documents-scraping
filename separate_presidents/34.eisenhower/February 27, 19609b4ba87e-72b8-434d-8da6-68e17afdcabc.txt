Remarks Upon Arrival at the Airport, San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina.
President Frondizi, Mayor Sacido, ladies and gentlemen:
I have heard much of the scenic and climatic wonders of Bariloche. With no more than the view from the plane and my first breaths of air in this gorgeous setting, it is already evident that my informants were not exaggerating.
I arrive among you with new and indelible impressions of another part of your country. On the way to Bariloche, we flew over Patagonia. Even at high altitude, we could note the remarkable progress being made in the development of that Province. It appears to me that Patagonia. is to Argentina what the western frontier was to the United States of America a century ago. Few are the countries in the shrinking world of today which possess a physical frontier. They are indeed fortunate, for the world will soon need the products of such land, and conquering it is a great challenge to the vitality, spirit, and courage of a people. I know you are abundantly blessed with these qualifies.
Here among you, I am to have an opportunity to discuss informally many hemispheric and world problems, as well as to have a few hours of rest and relaxation. For this, and for the warmth of your welcome, I am most grateful.
Salud!
Note: The President spoke at 4:35 p.m. after which the two Presidents left the airport by helicopter for the Llao Llao Hotel.
