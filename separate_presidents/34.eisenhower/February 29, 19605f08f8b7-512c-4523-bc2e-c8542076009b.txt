Remarks at the American Embassy Residence in Santiago Upon Receiving a Scroll From the Chilean-American Cultural Institute
FOR A good many years I have been preaching that the only real need in the world is for peace, and you are going to get no peace except by understanding among nations. You see, all of us realize that no people wants war, and we are amazed that governments succeed, sometimes, in getting us into war.
The feeling for peace is universal, and if we could get together so well in our understanding that we would forbid governments to get us into war, there would be a great burden lifted from the backs of men.
We are spending so much of our substance, so much of our talent, so much of our man hours of work just for the destructive and sterile instruments of war, that it seems to me the greatest tragedy that almost has come to this world, particularly now, when we realize what one single bomb taken to each city can do.
It is time that this kind of thinking that you are doing in your way becomes universal, not only among all of the free nations; we have got to get better acquaintanceship with the people behind the Iron Curtain, because in their hearts there is this fundamental longing for peace. Hatred of war is just as firm in their hearts as it is in ours.
So, if we can do that, take one little step in the forwarding of such a great objective as this, then I think our efforts--indeed, our lives--are worth while. Because it is only by millions and millions of small efforts that this is going to come about.
So I accept this, not only with great pride in joining your organization, but because of my respect for the work which you are undertaking.
Thank you very much indeed.
Note: The President spoke at 6:05 p.m. after receiving an honorary membership in the Chilean-American Cultural Institute.
