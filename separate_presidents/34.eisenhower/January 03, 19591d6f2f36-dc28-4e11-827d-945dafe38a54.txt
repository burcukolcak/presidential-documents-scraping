Statement by the President on the Launching of a Space Probe by the U.S.S.R.
THE SUCCESSFUL launching, as announced by the Soviets, of a vehicle designed to pass near the moon, represents a great stride forward in man's advance into the infinite reaches of outer space. To the scientists and engineers assigned to this undertaking, a full measure of credit is due and we congratulate them on this achievement.
