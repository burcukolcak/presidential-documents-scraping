Remarks Upon Signing the Proclamation Admitting Alaska to the Union and the Executive Order Changing the Flag of the United States.
GENTLEMEN, I think that all of us recognize this as an historic occasion. Certainly for myself I feel very highly privileged and honored to welcome the forty-ninth State into the Union.
Such a ceremony has not taken place in almost half a century, so at least I have the feeling of self-gratification that I am not just one of a group in this kind of ceremony.
To the State itself, to its people, I extend on behalf of all their sister States, best wishes and hope for prosperity and success. And to each of you gentlemen elected to high office to represent your new State, in both State and Federal offices, my congratulations, my felicitations, and my hope that we will all work together to the benefit of all forty-nine States.

Certainly, I pledge to you my cooperation in that effort.
And now, as far as these pens are concerned, I hope there's one for each of you people who has worked so hard to bring this about.
Note: The ceremony was held in the Cabinet Room at noon. Among those present were Senators-elect E. L. Bartlett and Ernest Gruening, Representative-elect Ralph J. Rivers, Acting Governor Waino Hendrickson, Michael A. Stepovich, former Governor of Alaska, and Robert Atwood, Publisher of the Anchorage Daily Times.
The new 49-star flag, to become official on July 4, was unfurled immediately after the President signed the documents. Proclamation 3269 "Admission of the State of Alaska into the Union" and Executive Order 10798 "Flag of the United States" are published in the Federal Register (24 F.R. 79 and 81, respectively).
