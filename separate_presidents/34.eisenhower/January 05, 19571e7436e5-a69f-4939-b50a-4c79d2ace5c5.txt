Each year, on the fifth of January, it is a privilege to join in honoring the memory of George Washington Carver. Though born a slave, Dr. Carver grew up a free man and through his achievements became the servant of all. He is considered one of the greatest chemurgists of our time. In his full and beneficial life he made outstanding contributions in the field of agriculture, and strengthened the economy of the Nation.
Dr. Carver's scientific mind complemented his religious convictions. He practiced his belief in the Fatherhood of God and in the Brotherhood of Man. He demonstrated the wisdom of our American heritage of equality; he was a living example of the fact that genius is found among all peoples.
As we pay tribute to the memory of George Washington Carver, we rededicate ourselves to the fundamental principle of a common humanity upon which our Nation is founded and from which we gain continual strength.
