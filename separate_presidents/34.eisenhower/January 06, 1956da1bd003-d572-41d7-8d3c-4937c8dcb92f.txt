Letter to George A. Garrett Concerning the Redevelopment of Southwest Washington.
[Released January 6, 1956. Dated January 1, 1956]
Dear Mr. Garrett:
I am very glad to have your final report concerning the Redevelopment of Southwest Washington. It is indeed heartening to know that the efforts of the agencies cooperating in the project will result in early initiation of construction and in a complete rebuilding of the designated area. Certainly the Capital of this great nation deserves to be a symbol of our best efforts to provide decent housing and attractive urban living.
I should want the cooperating agencies to know, therefore, that in the furtherance of these plans and achievement of the redevelopment benefits that you point out so graphically, they will have earned the lasting gratitude of the people of Washington and, indeed, of the entire nation.
In expediting the redevelopment plans you have made an important contribution. I am very grateful for your devoted efforts in this public service.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
