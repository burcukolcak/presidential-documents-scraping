Statement by the President Honoring Charles A. Halleck and Joseph W. Martin.
IT IS ALWAYS unfortunate that in a contest between one's friends the good fortune of one has to be at the expense of the other.
During the last six years I have met weekly, during Congressional Sessions, with Mr. Halleek and Mr. Martin and their associates. I have relied confidently on their advice and cooperation.
To Charlie Halleek, the new Republican Leader of the House, my warm congratulations. He will be a fine leader.
To Joe Martin my heartfelt thanks for his long years of loyal and effective service. I am sure that his rich experience and wise counsel will continue to be of great value to me, to our Party, and our country.
Note: Joseph W. Martin, Jr., of North Attleboro, Mass., was elected to the 69th Congress in 1924 and to each succeeding Congress. He served as Minority Leader in the 76th through the 85th Congresses, with the exception of the 80th and the 83d in which he served as Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Charles A. Halleck, of Rensselaer, Indiana, served continuously following his election to the 74th Congress in 1935. He was elected Minority Leader in the 86th Congress. During the 80th and 83d Congresses he served as Majority Leader.
