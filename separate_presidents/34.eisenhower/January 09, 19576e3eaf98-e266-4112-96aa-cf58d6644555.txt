Statement by the President on the Resignation of Sir Anthony Eden.
I HAVE JUST BEEN INFORMED of the official announcement of the resignation of Sir Anthony Eden as head of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom.
Sir Anthony is an old and good friend. During the days of World War II and since, there have been few periods when he and I were not engaged in the study of some problem common to our two countries. Through the years I have developed for him a great respect and admiration.
As Foreign Minister and then as Prime Minister, Sir Anthony has been a dedicated leader in the cause of freedom. He is a staunch believer in the need for unity among the community of free nations, especially between his country and ours.
Mrs. Eisenhower and I extend to him and to Lady Eden our hopes that Sir Anthony will soon fully recover his health so that he may have many useful years of happiness ahead.
