Proclamation 3167—Sesquicentennial of the Coast and Geodetic Survey

Whereas, by an act of Congress approved February 10, 1807 (2 Stat. 413), President Thomas Jefferson was authorized and requested to cause a survey to be taken of the coasts of the United States and to take such further action as he deemed proper for completing an accurate chart of every part of these coasts; and
Whereasthe observance of the 150th anniversary of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, which traces its origins to the above-mentioned act, will honor the services of the officers and employees of the Coast and Geodetic Survey who have maintained so zealously the reputation of our Nation in the development of mathematical and physical sciences related to higher surveying and cartography; and
Whereasthe Coast and Geodetic Survey, in surveying uncharted coastal waters and in mapping virgin regions of our country and its territories and possessions, has been safeguarding life and commerce for a century and a half; and
Whereasthe devotion, industry, efficiency, and enterprise of Coast and Geodetic Survey personnel throughout the years have set an enviable record of public service:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of February 1957 as Coast and Geodetic Survey Month; and I call upon my fellow citizens to salute the Coast and Geodetic Survey during that month with ceremonies designed to give appropriate recognition to one of our oldest and most respected Federal agencies on the occasion of its sesquicentennial anniversary.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this tenth day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
