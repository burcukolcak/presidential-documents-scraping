Letter Accepting Resignation of Maurice H. Stans as Director, Bureau of the Budget. January , 11 1961
[ Released January 11, 1961. Dated January 10, 1961 ]
Dear Maury:
Your efforts on behalf of sound budgetary policies and the promotion of efficiency throughout the Executive Branch of government have been of invaluable assistance to me. In accepting your resignation as Director of the Bureau of the Budget, effective January 20, 1961, I wish to tall you what a superb job you have done.
You have worked tirelessly to insure that the Federal government provides adequately for national needs, while maintaining responsible fiscal policy. Your labors have helped to show that government can be run humanely within the framework of a balanced budget.
Your intensive attention to improving financial management practices in the Federal government has resulted in great savings in time and money and increased efficiency and service to the taxpayer. Your report outlines these improvements--the work of the Office of Financial Management in the Bureau of the Budget, improved accounting systems, training institutes, important changes in the annual budget process, adoption of Hoover Commission recommendations, new automatic data processing.
As you reenter private life, please accept my deep appreciation and gratitude. Good luck on your safari and best wishes for a future of good health and happiness.
With warm regard,

As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
