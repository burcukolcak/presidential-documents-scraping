Special Message to the Senate Transmitting the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States and the Republic of Korea.
To the United States Senate:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Korea signed at Washington on October 1, 1953.
I transmit also for the information of the Senate a document containing the joint statement by President Syngman Rhee of the Republic of Korea and by the Secretary of State on August 8, 1953, on the occasion of the initialing of the Mutual Defense Treaty in Seoul, and the text of an address by the Secretary of State on the occasion of the signing of the Mutual Defense Treaty on October 1, 1953.
There is further transmitted for the information of the Senate the report made to me by the Secretary of State regarding the aforesaid treaty.
The Mutual Defense Treaty signed by the United States and the Republic of Korea is designed to deter aggression by giving evidence of our common determination to meet the common danger. It thus reaffirms our belief that the security of an individual nation in the free world depends upon the security of its partners, and constitutes another link in the collective security of the free nations of the Pacific.
I recommend that the Senate give early favorable consideration to the treaty submitted herewith, and advise and consent to its ratification.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The treaty and related papers are published in Senate Executive A, 83d Congress. The treaty was approved by the Senate on January 26 and after ratification entered into force November 17, 1954 (5 UST 2368).
