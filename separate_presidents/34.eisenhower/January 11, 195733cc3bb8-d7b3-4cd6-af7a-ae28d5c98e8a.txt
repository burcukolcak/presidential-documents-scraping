Statement by the President on the Resignation of Leonard W. Hall as Chairman, Republican National Committee.
LEONARD W. HALL has just informed me that he plans to resign as Chairman of the Republican National Committee.
Naturally, I sincerely regret his decision for I have valued highly his wise political advice and party leadership. But I must accept his decision, no matter how reluctant I may be to do SO.
Leonard Hall has been a great Chairman. Under his guidance and direction, the Republican Party organization has been revitalized and reorganized. Today, largely through his efforts, the party is attracting many thousands of new supporters, particularly from the younger voters of our nation.
Mr. Hall tells me he is going to take a much-needed vacation. I sincerely hope that his wisdom and his long years of experience as a legislator, Judge and Chairman, will continue to be available not only to the party but to the nation in the years ahead.
