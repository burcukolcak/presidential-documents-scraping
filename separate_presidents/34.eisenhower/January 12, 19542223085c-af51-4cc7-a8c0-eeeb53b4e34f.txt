WILLIAM R. CHARETTE

HOSPITAL CORPSMAN THIRD CLASS

UNITED STATES NAVY
for service as set forth in the following
CITATION:
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a Medical corpsman, serving with a Marine Rifle Company, in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea during the early morning hours of 27 March 1953. Participating in a fierce encounter with a cleverly concealed and well-entrenched enemy force occupying positions on a vital and bitterly contested outpost far in advance of the main line of resistance, CHARETTE repeatedly and unhesitatingly moved about through a murderous barrage of hostile small-arms and mortar fire to render assistance to his wounded comrades. When an enemy grenade landed within a few feet of a Marine he was attending, he immediately threw himself upon the stricken man and absorbed the entire concussion of the deadly missile with his own body. Although sustaining painful facial wounds, and undergoing shock from the intensity of the blast which ripped the helmet and medical aid kit from his person, CHARETTE resourcefully improvised emergency bandages by tearing off part of his clothing, and gallantly continued to administer medical aid to the wounded in his own unit and to those in adjacent platoon areas as well. Observing a seriously wounded comrade whose armored vest had been torn from his body by the blast from an exploding shell, he selflessly removed his own battle vest and placed it upon the helpless man although fully aware of the added jeopardy to himself. Moving to the side of another casualty who was suffering excruciating pain from a serious leg wound, CHARETTE stood upright in the trench line and exposed himself to a deadly hail of enemy fire in order to lend more effective aid to the victim and to alleviate his anguish while being removed to a position of safety. By his indomitable courage and inspiring efforts in behalf of his wounded comrades, CHARETTE was directly responsible for saving many lives. His great personal valor reflects the highest credit upon himself and enhances the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

THE PRESIDENT of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress March 3, 1863 has awarded in the name of The Congress the Medal of Honor to
FIRST LIEUTENANT EDWARD R. SCHOWALTER, JR.,

UNITED STATES ARMY
for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy:
First Lieutenant Edward R. Schowalter, Jr., 064 446, Infantry, United States Army, Commanding, Company A, gist Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and indomitable courage above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy near Kumhwa, Korea, on 14 October 1959. Committed to attack and occupy a key approach to the primary objective, the First Platoon of his company came under heavy vicious small arms, grenade and mortar fire within fifty yards of the enemy-held strong point, halting the advance and inflicting several casualties. The Second Platoon moved up in support at this juncture, and although wounded, Lieutenant Schowalter continued to spearhead the assault. Nearing the objective he was severely wounded by a grenade fragment but, refusing medical aid, he led his men into the trenches and began routing the enemy from the bunkers with grenades. Suddenly from a burst of fire from a hidden cave off the trench he was again wounded. Although suffering from his wounds, he refused to relinquish command and continued issuing orders and encouraging his men until the commanding ground was secured and then he was evacuated. Lieutenant Schowalter's unflinching courage, extraordinary heroism and inspirational leadership reflect the highest credit upon himself and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.

THE PRESIDENT of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress March 3, 1863 has awarded in the name of The Congress the Medal of Honor to
PRIVATE FIRST CLASS ERNEST E. WEST,

UNITED STATES ARMY
for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy:
Private First Class Ernest E. West, US 52 151 286, Infantry, United States Army, a member of Company L, 14th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy near Sataeri, Korea, on 12 October 1952. He voluntarily accompanied a contingent to locate and destroy a reported enemy outpost. Nearing the objective, the patrol was ambushed and suffered numerous casualties. Observing his wounded leader lying in an exposed position, he ordered the troops to withdraw, then braved intense fire to reach and assist him. While attempting evacuation, he was attacked by three hostile soldiers employing grenades and small arms fire. Quickly shifting his body to shelter the officer, he killed the assailants with his rifle, then carried the helpless man to safety. He was critically wounded and lost an eye in this action, but courageously returned through withering fire and bursting shells to assist the wounded and, while evacuating two comrades, closed with and killed three more of the foe. Private West's indomitable spirit, consummate valor and intrepid actions inspired all who observed him, reflecting highest credit upon himself and upholding the honored traditions of the military service.
