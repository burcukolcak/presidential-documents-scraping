Memorandum on the Red Cross Campaign.
To the Heads of Executive Departments, Commissions and Agencies:
The American Red Cross is a national fellowship of good will, a mighty force for unity. In joining the Red Cross, we multiply the helpfulness that any one of us could extend alone. Our memberships make possible blood for the sick and injured; assistance for our servicemen and veterans in personal and family emergencies; recovery from the shock and loss of disaster to those struck down by catastrophes. The concern of the Red Cross extends to other vital health and safety programs that make our towns and cities better communities in which to live.
I know that in the forthcoming annual Red Cross Campaign for Members and Funds, America will again make certain that the organization is provided with the resources it needs. I am equally confident that Federal employees will be in the vanguard of all those who help keep the Red Cross on the job. We in the Federal service can, by our example, inspire our fellow citizens everywhere to join us as members of Red Cross. This year marks the Seventy-fifth Anniversary of the American National Red Cross. This Anniversary is a great occasion. Let us celebrate it greatly by giving enthusiastic and generous support.
I have designated the Honorable Douglas McKay, Secretary of the Interior, as Chairman of the Government Unit in the Washington Metropolitan Area. I urge everyone to pledge to Secretary McKay his unqualified assistance.
