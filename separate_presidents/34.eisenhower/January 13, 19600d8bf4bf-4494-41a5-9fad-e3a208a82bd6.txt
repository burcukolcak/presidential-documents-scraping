Letter to Gordon Gray Designating Him Chairman of the Operations Coordinating Board.
Dear Mr. Gray:
I hereby designate you Chairman of the Operations Coordinating Board, vice Mr. Robert D. Murphy, to perform duties in accordance with Executive Order 10700 dated February 25, 1957, as mended, in addition to your other duties. I know that you are thoroughly familiar with the work of the OCB through your service as a member of the Board since July 1958. In view of your continuing responsibility as the principal supervisory officer of the work of the National Security Council in formulating national security policies including those assigned by me to the OCB for coordination, you are in a position to provide impartial and objective guidance and leadership to the Board.
This new assignment is one step which I feel should be taken toward enabling the President to look to one office for staff assistance in the whole range of national security affairs.
I reiterate the importance I attach to the Board's responsibilities.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Gray was serving as Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.
