Letter Accepting Resignation of William P. Rogers as Attorney General.
[Released January 13, 1961. Dated January 11, 1961 ]
Dear Bill:
Under your direction, the Department of Justice has been noted for its impartial and effective administration of Federal law. In accepting your resignation as Attorney General, effective January 20, 1961, I take the opportunity to emphasize the outstanding record you have achieved with the assistance of your competent staff.
I am particularly gratified by the establishment and functioning of the new Civil Rights Division. Then too, the outstanding record of the Department in bringing anti-trust actions--a 25 per cent increase over the previous eight-year period--is most impressive. Indeed, as your report so well relates, every section of your Department has made commendable advances.
For guiding these achievements, as well as many more that come to mind, you have my thanks and deep appreciation. May the future hold good health and happiness. You leave government service with my respect and sincere friendship.
With warm regard,

As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Rogers served as Attorney General from November 8, 1957, to January 20, 1961. His letter of resignation, dated January 10, and his report were released with the President's reply.
