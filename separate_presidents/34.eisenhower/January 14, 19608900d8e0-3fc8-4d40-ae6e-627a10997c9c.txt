Dwight D. Eisenhower
January 14, 1960

Letter to T. Keith Glennan, Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, on High Thrust Space Vehicles.
Dear Dr. Glennan:
As we have agreed, it is essential to press forward vigorously to increase our capability in high thrust space vehicles.
You are hereby directed to make a study, to be completed at the earliest date practicable, of the possible need for additional funds for the balance of FY 1960 and for FY 1961 to accelerate the super booster program for which your agency recently was given technical and management responsibility.
Consistent with my decision to assign a high priority to the Saturn development, you are directed, as an immediate measure, to use such additional overtime as you may deem necessary on this project.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The White House announced on February 1, at Denver, Colo., that as a result of Dr. Glennan's study the President had approved an amendment in the fiscal year 1961 appropriation request for NASA adding $113 million to accelerate progress on Saturn and other elements of the Nation's super booster program.
