Dwight D. Eisenhower
January 15, 1961

Letter Accepting Resignation of Arthur S. Flemming as Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.
Dear Arthur:
The dramatic progress in raising the level of health, education, and economic security, through the broad programs administered by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare under your leadership, is a monumental tribute to your organizational skill, understanding of human problems, and ability to see a job through. In accepting your resignation, effective January 20, 1961, I wish to express my deep appreciation to you and your able staff.
On all fronts great gains have been made since my recommendation to establish the Department was approved in 1953. As your report indicates, medical research and health facilities have been significantly expanded; a new Division of Radiological Health has been created; major improvements have been made in fighting air and water pollution; the National Defense Education Act of 1958 has already become a landmark in the history of American education, and Social Security coverage has been broadened and benefits increased.
As you return to private life, I wish you a future of good health and happiness. You take with you my deep thanks and lasting friendship.
With warm regard,

As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Secretary Flemming served from August ,, 1958, to January 20, 1961. His letter of resignation and his report were released with the President's reply.
