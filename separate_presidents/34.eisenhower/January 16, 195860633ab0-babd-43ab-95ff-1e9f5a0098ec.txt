Letter to Major General U. S. Grant 3d, President, American Planning and Civic Association, Concerning Billboards Along Highways.
[ Released January 16, 1958. Dated January 15, 1958 ]
Dear General Grant:
Thank you very much for informing me of your feeling that legislation is needed to provide for the prohibition of billboards on certain private property abutting the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways.
As you may know, I again expressed my concern about this problem in my Budget Message just submitted to the Congress.
I am convinced that this activity must be controlled and regulated if the public is to have the safe driving conditions and surroundings contemplated by the high standards applicable to the Interstate System. While it is desirable that the control and regulation of outdoor advertising be left to the States, I believe that Federal legislation on the subject is necessary to assure effective State action. The Department of Commerce last year submitted to the Congress a proposal which would accomplish this objective and the Secretary again reiterated the Administration's position before the Subcommittee on Public Roads of the Senate Committee on Public Works last week.
It is earnestly hoped that consideration of this important problem by the Congress this session will result in the enactment of legislation which will produce the desired results.

With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The President's letter was in reply to a letter from General Grant, dated December 27, 1957. Both were included in the release.
