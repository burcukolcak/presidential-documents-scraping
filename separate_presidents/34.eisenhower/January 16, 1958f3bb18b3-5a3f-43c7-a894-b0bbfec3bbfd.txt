Memorandum Concerning the First of the President's Awards for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service.
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:

I am announcing today that the first President's Awards for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service are being made to these five career employees:

Loy W. Henderson, Deputy Under Secretary of State for Administration.
Sterling B. Hendricks, Chief Chemist, Agriculture's Pioneering Research Laboratory for Mineral Nutrition of Plants.

John Edgar Hoover, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Roger W. Jones, Assistant Director for Legislative Reference, Bureau of the Budget.
William B. McLean, Technical Director, U. S. Naval Ordnance Test Station ( China Lake, California).
I know you share my great satisfaction in their exceptional contributions to this Nation in the fields of diplomacy, science, law enforcement, and administration. Their accomplishments exemplify the great capabilities of the people in the Federal service.
It is of the utmost importance that we develop and utilize the full ingenuity and skill of every employee. Never has there been a more vital need for new ideas and superior performance in all fields of endeavor. To meet better this need, management must provide a working climate in which employees are encouraged to do their best. Certainly, public recognition of achievements is a valuable asset to maintaining such a climate.
During 1958 we will be celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the Federal merit system of employment. It is particularly gratifying that these first Awards for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service could be announced today, the 75th Anniversary of the signing of the Civil Service Act. Throughout this year we should bring to the attention of all the people the accomplishments of Federal career employees whose dedicated service is contributing significantly to the effective operations of government.
