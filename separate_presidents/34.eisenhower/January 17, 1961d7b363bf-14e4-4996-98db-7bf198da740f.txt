Dwight D. Eisenhower
January 17, 1961

Statement by the President on the Sugar Act.
I HAVE instructed the Secretary of Agriculture to transmit to the Congress of the United States a recommendation for extension and amendment of the Sugar Act of 1948, as amended, from its present expiration date of March 31, 1961, through December 31, 1961. I have also indicated my belief that a nine-months extension is imperative to maintain a stable sugar market in the interest of domestic producers and consumers, if the Congress is to have time enough to develop longer range legislation.
In accordance with my statement of December 16, 1960, I have again asked the Congress to relieve the Executive of the obligation to purchase from the Dominican Republic a portion of the sugar needed to replace that formerly obtained from Cuba.
Note: For the President's statement of December 16, 1960, see Item 374.
