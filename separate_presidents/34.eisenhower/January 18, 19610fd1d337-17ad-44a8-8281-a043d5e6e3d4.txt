Dear Arthur:
Thank you for the summary of the work of the Advisory Committee on Government Organization.
The constructive advice of this Committee has played a large part in promoting economy and efficiency in the Executive Branch of the Government. I am especially pleased with the Committee's contribution to the reorganization of the Department of Defense and the creation of three major agencies of government--the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Federal Aviation Agency, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
I again wish to express my appreciation to you, as Chairman, and to your colleagues on the Committee.
With warm regard,

As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
