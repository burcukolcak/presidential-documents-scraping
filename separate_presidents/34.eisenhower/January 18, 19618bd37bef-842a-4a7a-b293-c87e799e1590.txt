CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF

THE MEDAL OF FREEDOM

TO

GEORGE BOGDAN KISTIAKOWSKY

FOR EXCEPTIONALLY MERITORIOUS SERVICE

AND DISTINGUISHED CONTRIBUTION

TO THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES
For more than two decades George Kistiakowsky has worked tirelessly for the advancement of science and for the development of military technology.
During World War II and in the years since, he has been a major contributor to the success of vital defense projects--a courageous spirit and guiding force in the forefront of development activities, giving generously of his time while continuing his important work as a distinguished scientist and teacher. He has labored to promote the progress and understanding of science in the interests of mankind everywhere. Seeking safeguarded arms control in the interest of security and peace, he served at the international conference table on measures to prevent surprise attack.
As my Special Assistant for Science and Technology, he has combined scientific judgment and statesmanship, lending wise counsel, knowledge and experience to the framing of national policies that have served to keep our country strong and secure. In recognition of his outstanding service and his abiding dedication to the national interest, I award him the Medal of Freedom.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
