By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 179 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (5 U. S. C. 6) and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, it is ordered as follows:
I hereby authorize and direct the Assistant Secretaries of Labor and the Solicitor of Labor, in the order designated as hereinafter provided, to perform the duties of the office of the Secretary of Labor in case of the absence, sickness, resignation, or death of both the Secretary of Labor and the Under Secretary of Labor.
The Assistant Secretaries of Labor and the Solicitor of Labor shall act as Secretary of Labor as herein provided (1) in such order as the Secretary of Labor (or the Under Secretary when acting as Secretary) may by order designate from time to time, or (2) if no such designation order is in effect at the time, in the order of the respective dates of their commissions, or in the event that two or more of their commissions bear the same date, in the order in which they shall have taken their oath of office.
