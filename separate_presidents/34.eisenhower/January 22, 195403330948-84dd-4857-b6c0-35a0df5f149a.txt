Memorandum Concerning Purchase of Savings Bonds by Government Employees.
Memorandum to the Heads of Departments and Agencies:
The nation's economic welfare requires the widest possible distribution of the national debt through the continued sale of United States Savings Bonds to the people. To this end it is important that Government employees continue their leadership in the purchase of Savings Bonds through the Pay Roll Savings Plan.
The Interdepartmental Savings Bond Committee established by Executive Order No. 9953 of April 23, 1948, provides a vehicle for the effective promotion of the Pay Roll Savings Plan. This Committee is composed of the heads of the several executive departments and agencies or their designated alternates.
I therefore request that each of you give the fullest cooperation to the Chairman, Mr. Edward F. Bartelt, Fiscal Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, in the work of the Committee. Any of you who will be unable to work personally with the Committee should immediately designate an alternate from among the senior officials of your department or agency.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
