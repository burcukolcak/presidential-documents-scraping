Statement by the President on the Occasion of the 80th Birthday of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur.
AS GENERAL OF THE ARMY Douglas MacArthur reaches four score years of a life that in service and in distinction has had few equals in all our history, I speak for every citizen in expressing to him warm felicitations and the wish that he may have many more years of fruitful and rewarding activity. '
For more than a haft century of active military service, in both World Wars and the Korean conflict as well, General MacArthur's name has been a symbol of courage, of patriotism, and of inspired generalship. Together these earn him a foremost place in the hearts of our people, and in the annals of our military endeavors. I value most highly my own years of service with this great leader and soldier. With Americans everywhere, I salute General MacArthur on his eightieth birthday.
