Dwight D. Eisenhower
January 28, 1957

Letter to Herbert Hoover, Jr., Under Secretary of State.
Dear Herbert:
As the day of your actual departure from Washington comes nearer, I want to repeat my deep regret and, above all, the hope that in due course, and at some not distant date, you will be available again to serve your Government, as you have done so patriotically over the last four years. I want you to know that a hearty welcome always awaits you.
With best wishes to you and Mrs. Hoover,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Hoover served as Under Secretary of State from October 4, 1954, to February 6, 1957.
