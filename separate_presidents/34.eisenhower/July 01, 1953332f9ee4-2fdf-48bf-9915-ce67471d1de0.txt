Memorandum on Community Chest and United Defense Fund-USO Campaign in the National Capital Area.
To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
For the fall Red Feather Campaign for the Community Chest Federation and the United Defense Fund-USO in the National Capital Area I have approved the appointment of the Honorable Douglas McKay, Secretary of the Interior, as Chairman for the Government Unit.
I ask that you give him your fullest measure of support and assistance. All persons in authority in the Federal and District Government, I am sure, will extend their complete cooperation to this important charitable appeal. Such cooperation would logically include the assumption of equitable unit goals, the effective solicitation of all employees, and the setting up of an adequate collection method for the convenience of those who wish to make contributions on an installment basis.
In the National Capital Area the Community Chest Federation unites six Community Chests and more than one hundred Red Feather Agencies in one federated campaign to provide local health, welfare and recreational programs which are so vital to the building of a healthy, strong and safer community in which to live, work and play.
Included in the Red Feather Campaign this year will be the appeal of the United Defense Fund which includes, among others, the USO-USO Camp Shows and United Community Defense Services. These programs are essential to the morale and happiness of our men and women of the Armed Forces both at home and overseas.
It is my hope that all officials and employees will be given the opportunity to contribute and that they will do so generously, mindful of the fact that this is one appeal for the yearly support of over one hundred Red Feather agency programs and the UDFUSO. When you give--give your fair share to support these worthwhile services for a full year.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
