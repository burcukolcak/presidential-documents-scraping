Message to President Nkrumah on the Occasion of the Accession of Ghana to the Status of Republic.
Dear Mr. President:
Upon the accession of your country to the status of Republic and upon your inauguration as its first President I extend in my own name and on behalf of the people of the United States most cordial greetings and felicitations to you and your countrymen.
In the more than three years of close relations between an independent Ghana and this country strong bonds of friendship and mutual interests have developed. It is the sincere hope of the Government and people of the United States that these bonds will continue to grow stronger in the years to come.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
