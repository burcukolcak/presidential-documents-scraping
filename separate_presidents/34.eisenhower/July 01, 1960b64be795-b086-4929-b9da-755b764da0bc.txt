Message to President Osman on the Occasion of the Independence of the Somali Republic.
Dear Mr. President:
It is with the greatest of pleasure that I extend in my own name and on behalf of the people of the United States most cordial greetings and heartfelt congratulations upon the independence of the Somali Republic.
We share deeply in your joy in this occasion for not only does a new state join the family of nations but your country's accession to independence marks the successful conclusion of another United Nations trusteeship. This, understandably, is a source of great pride and satisfaction to all who have dedicated themselves to making the United Nations an effective instrument of world peace and progress and I am confident that in the years to come your country will strengthen the ranks of those devoted to this noble purpose
The Government and people of the United States welcome the independence of your country and look forward to a lasting friendship with your Government and people.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
