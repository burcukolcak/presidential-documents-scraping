Memorandum on the United Givers Fund Campaign in the National Capital Area.
Memorandum [or the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
Voluntary health, welfare and character-building services greatly contribute to a healthy, strong and safe community for ourselves and our children. Next Fall, in the National Capital Area, the "United Givers Fund" campaign will unite for the first time the more than one hundred Red Feather agencies of the six local Community Chests, all of the American National Red Cross local chapters, the USO-USO Camp Shows and certain national health agencies. This is the initial campaign of the United Givers Fund. It is also the first of two campaigns in the Greater Washington Metropolitan Area to be conducted in Federal offices under the new approved Federal service fund-raising policy. I should like all Federal employees to join with me in making this community fund-raising effort an outstanding success.
I appoint the Honorable James P. Mitchell, Secretary of Labor, to act as Chairman of the 1956 Government Unit of the United Givers Fund in this first appeal under the new Federal program.
Every Government official, employee and all military personnel on duty in the National Capital Area will be given the opportunity to contribute voluntarily to the 1956 United Givers Fund. I urge that everyone give the Chairman his full measure of support in this worthy effort.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
