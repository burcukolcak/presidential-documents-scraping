Statement by the President Regarding Aid for the People of the Soviet Zone of Germany.
CHANCELLOR ADENAUER has addressed to me a letter asking that the United States Government participate in aiding the people of Eastern Germany whose food supply has been steadily deteriorating.
I have been distressed to learn of the plight of the people of Eastern Germany. I have, therefore, replied to Chancellor Adenauer informing him that this Government would join him in making food available to the people of Eastern Germany. Simultaneously, I have instructed the American Charge d'Affaires in Moscow to make an offer of food to be distributed in Eastern Germany. I have directed the Secretary of State and the Mutual Security Administrator to take steps to see that this food is made available in Germany without delay. I have indicated to the Soviet Government my confidence that practical ways for immediate distribution can be developed so that the food shortages afflicting the East German population may be alleviated quickly.
I invite the other nations of the free world to join us in this action of aiding the people of Eastern Germany in this emergency.
Note: The letter from Chancellor Adenauer appears in the note to Item 135.
The text of a U.S. note to the U.S.S.R., in the form of instructions to the Charge d'Affaires in Moscow, was also released. The note, together with the Soviet reply refusing the offer of food, is published in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 29, p. 68).
