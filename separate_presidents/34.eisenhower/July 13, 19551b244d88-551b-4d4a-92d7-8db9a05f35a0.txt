Letter to Secretary Wilson Marking the Third Anniversary of Operation Skywatch
[Released July 13, 1955. Dated June 21, 1955]
Dear Mr. Secretary:
The third anniversary of Operation Skywatch on July fourteenth affords me an opportunity to express once again my respect and admiration for those citizens who continue to give unselfishly of their time and effort in the Ground Observer Corps.
Through their steadfastness they help to do, in the only way it can be done, a job of vital importance to all Americans. To all in the Ground Observer Corps I should like to say again that I cannot over-emphasize the importance of the role they, volunteers, play in national defense. As you have pointed out, they have undoubtedly strengthened the capabilities of our continental defense system, and in so doing they have helped to deter aggression.
As you mark the third anniversary of Skywatch, please convey to all Ground Observers past and present my personal word of appreciation and congratulations. I hope the effort to seek additional volunteers for the expanded program will meet with the greatest success.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
