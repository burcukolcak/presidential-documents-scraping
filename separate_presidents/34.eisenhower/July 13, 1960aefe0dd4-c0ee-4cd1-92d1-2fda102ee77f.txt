Telegram to Senator Mansfield Welcoming a Security Council Discussion of the RB-47 Plane Incident.
Dear Senator Mansfield:
Thank you for your telegram in which you suggest that the matter of the shooting down of the U.S. Air force RB-47 airplane be brought before the Security Council of the United Nations.
As you will have noted from this government's reply of July 12th to the Soviet note of July 11th, the United States has proposed to the Soviet government that a joint investigation be made. This action was taken pursuant to the provisions of the United Nations Charter, which calls upon the parties to an international dispute to attempt to settle their differences by negotiation or similar means prior to any action within the United Nations itself.
Press reports just received indicate that instead of responding to our proposal, the Soviet government is requesting a meeting of the Security Council on this subject. While we had contemplated recourse to the Security Council only after trying bilateral remedies specified in the Charter, we welcome the Security Council consideration of this question. We propose to make full use of this opportunity to focus world attention on the lawless actions and reckless threats of the Soviet government.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
