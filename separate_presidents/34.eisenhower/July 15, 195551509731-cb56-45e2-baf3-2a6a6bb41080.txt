Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill for the Relief of the Highway Construction Company.
I HAVE TODAY approved H.R. 4182 for the relief of Highway Company of Ohio, Incorporated, although a proviso inserted in the bill gave me some concern because its meaning is not made clear. That proviso reads as follows:

"Provided, That in making such determination of the excessive profits of the Highway Construction Company, the Tax Court of the United States may take into consideration the affiliation of that company with any other company, but the findings of such court shall be limited to determining only the amount, if any, of the excessive profits of the Highway Construction Company and such court shall have no authority under this Act to determine the amount, if any, of the excessive profits of any company affiliated with such Highway Construction Company."
After inquiries concerning the intended effect of this proviso, I am assured that it was designed for the sole purpose of protecting the interests of the United States.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 4182 is Public Law 208, 84th Congress (69 Stat. A72).
