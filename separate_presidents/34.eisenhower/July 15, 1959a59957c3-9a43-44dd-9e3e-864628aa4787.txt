Exchange of Messages Between the President and Frol R. Kozlov, First Deputy Chairman, Council of Ministers, U.S.S.R.
[Released July 15, 1959. Dated July 24, 1959]
Dear Mr. Kozlov:
Thank you for the thoughtful message which you sent to me on your departure from the United States. I hope that you enjoyed your stay in this country and that you have returned to Moscow with a better understanding of our people, our institutions, and our way of life. It is gratifying to know that you have been impressed with the desire of the American people for peace, a desire which represents their strongest mandate to their Government. This ardent desire is also inseparably linked with our firm belief in the rights of peoples everywhere to enjoy peace with justice and freedom.
I share the hope that the increasing contacts between our two countries, which your visit to us and the forthcoming visit of Vice President Nixon to the U.S.S.R. so well symbolize, will lead to a greatly improved mutual understanding between our peoples.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Kozlov's message of July 13 follows:
Dear Mr. President:
On leaving the United States I wish to express to you and all Americans who extended to us such a warm welcome, my heartfelt gratitude for the possibilities accorded us to get acquainted with your great country. We are leaving with confidence that the American people want peace just as our Soviet people. We are profoundly convinced that the expanding contacts between our countries, including those concerned with the Exhibition as well as meetings between statesmen of the USSR and the USA promote the improvement of our relations and will undoubtedly have favorable influence on reaching an agreement on international problems, the settlement of which is so eagerly expected by all peoples who so unswervingly stand for the preservation and strengthening of peace throughout the world.
F. KOZLOV
