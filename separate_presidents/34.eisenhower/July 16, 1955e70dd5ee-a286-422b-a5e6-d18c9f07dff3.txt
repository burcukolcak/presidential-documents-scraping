Remarks Upon Arrival at the Airport in Geneva.
Mr. President:
My wife and I--the party with us--are deeply touched by the honor you have paid us by coming here to the airport to greet us as we land in this wonderful nation of Switzerland.

We are honored that the Governor of the Republic and Canton of Geneva should come out--and the Mayor of the city.
Some eleven years ago, Mr. President, I came to Europe with an army, a navy, an air force, with a single purpose: to destroy Nazism. I came with the formations of war and all of the circumstances of war surrounded that journey at that time.
This time I come armed with something far more powerful: the good will of America--the great hopes of America--the aspirations of America for peace. That is why I have come here, in this beautiful country of yours, to meet with my colleagues from other countries to see whether it is not possible to find some road that will lead all mankind into a more tranquil, better, fuller way of life.

I thank you very much.
Note: The President's opening words referred to President Max Petitpierre of Switzerland.
