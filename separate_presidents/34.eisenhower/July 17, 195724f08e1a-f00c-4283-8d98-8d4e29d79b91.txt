Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Presidential Office Space.
Dear Mr. :
I am forwarding with this letter a report by the President's Advisory Commission on Presidential Office Space. This excellent report is the result of a very thorough and imaginative study of the problems involved in providing adequate and suitable office space for the Presidency. The study was made under authority of Public Law 954, 1956. The distinguished seven-man Commission included representatives of the Congress, the Executive Branch and the public.
Space problems have been a serious concern of every twentieth-century President. From time to time increases in office space have been provided through either remodeling or construction. However, these increases were often of a temporary or improvised nature and they have failed to keep pace with the growth in the size of the necessary Presidential staff. The Advisory Commission has very wisely sought to develop proposals which not only meet the immediate needs of the Presidency but which are permanent in nature and give attention to long range needs.
I am sure the Congress will want to give the most serious consideration to the recommendations made by the Commission. Congressional action is required both to authorize construction and to provide the necessary funds. Action by this Congress will do much to insure that future administrations have the proper office facilities to expedite the work of the Presidency.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
