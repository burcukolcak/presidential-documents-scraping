Dwight D. Eisenhower
July 18, 1958

Statement by the President Upon Signing Resolution Designating May as Loyalty Day.
I HAVE TODAY approved House Joint Resolution Number 479, designating May 1 as Loyalty Day, and calling for its appropriate observance by the people of this Nation. I am in accord with its purposes.
The naming of May 1st as Loyalty Day conflicts, however, with the observance of that day as Child Health Day pursuant to joint resolution passed by the Congress in 1928.
I therefore urge that the Congress enact legislation amending the act of May 28, 1928, 45 Stat. 616, by substituting the first Monday in October for May 1 as Child Health Day, thus avoiding the conflict that would otherwise result from simultaneous observances for different purposes.
Note: As enacted, House Joint Resolution 479 is Public Law 85-529 (72 Stat. 369).
