Remarks at the Research Reactor Building, Palais des Nations, Geneva.
I AM very grateful to the experts in charge of this building for conducting me through the reactor building and showing me so many of the working controls and operations.

Of course, I am very pleased that our country is able here to establish this reactor to help the scientists of the world to make progress along the lines of peaceful use of the atomic energy science, for the welfare of mankind.
In the United States we have so far made agreements with 24 different nations for the use of this same type of research reactor. There are students from 19 different countries going to school in the United States, learning about the technology that applies here--and you can see how necessary that is, just by looking around.
There are students from 32 countries undertaking to learn about the use of radio isotopes, and so on. So all in all this business is proceeding, and we are very pleased to have a part in it. We have set aside 200 kilograms of fissionable material so far to assist in the effort.
I am very hopeful that more than governments will get interested in this project. I hope that private business and professional men throughout the world will take an interest, and provide an incentive in finding new ways that this new science can be used.
In the meantime, I hope that everybody who gets a chance to see this one, will learn that there are really many, many ways in which atomic science can be used for the benefit of mankind and not destruction.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 3:20 p.m.
