Remarks Upon Arrival in Panama City for the Meeting of the Presidents of the Americas.
Mr. President and citizens of this great country:
It is a great honor for me to come back to the country where I served so many years, so long ago that it was before many of you were born. I left here in 1924, after three years of wonderful service among a wonderful people.
It is particularly our privilege to join here with the other Presidents of the Americas, and not only to celebrate an event--a great event in our history of 130 years ago--but in doing so to be able to pay our respects to the President of Panama and to its great people.
I consider it a privilege that I can here, during this visit, represent my people on that kind of errand, and join with the other Presidents of the Americas.
President Arias, I am particularly grateful to you for your warm words of welcome, and for the cordiality that you have expressed toward me, my party, and the people of America.
Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at the Tocumen Airport upon his arrival there at 8:04 a. m. In the second paragraph he referred to the first Inter-American Conference held in 1826.
