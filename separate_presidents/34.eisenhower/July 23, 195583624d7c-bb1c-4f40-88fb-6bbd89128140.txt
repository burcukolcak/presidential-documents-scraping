Remarks on Leaving Geneva.
Ladies and gentlemen:
As I leave Geneva, I want most of all, in saying goodbye, to thank the Mayor of this City, and each of its citizens who have been so cordial in the welcome they have extended to the American delegation.

My thanks of course include also the government--its President, all its officials, and of course to include the Governor of this Canton.
It has been a very great privilege to be among you and we will carry away many happy memories of your beautiful scenery and your very warm spirit of welcome and hospitality towards us.
I hope, indeed, that maybe some day I shall come back here again, when I am less busy and when I can see more of the people and less of the inner side of council chambers.

Goodbye and good luck to each of you.
NOTE.: The president spoke at the airport just before boarding the Columbine to return to Washington.
