Statement by the President Upon Appointing Members of the Second Hoover Commission.
THE FORMER PRESIDENT of the United States has once again placed his great talents at the disposal of the government, and I am sure that I speak for the people of the nation as I take this occasion to thank him publicly for responding to this call to duty.
The government is fortunate that Mr. Farley has likewise agreed to help the Commission in its work. His knowledge of government and its functions will be of inestimable value to the tremendous task confronting the Commission.
Note: The act establishing the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government (Second Hoover Commission) was approved by the President on July 10, 1953 (67 Stat. 142). On July 24 the White House announced that the President had appointed Herbert Hoover and James A. Farley as public representatives, and had designated the Attorney General, Herbert Brownell, and the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization, Arthur S. Flemming, as representatives of the executive branch. Additional members were appointed by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
