Remarks at Washington National Airport on Returning From Geneva.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
After the hard week that I have been through it's very heartwarming to have such a reception as this as I come back to our Capital City.
Just what will be the result of this conference, of course, no one knows but the coming months will tell much. But in the meantime, we do know that new contacts have been established and there is evidence of a new friendliness in the world. For my part, if there is one man I would single out as deserving the thanks of the American people, it would be Foster Dulles, a man who represents us in every kind of conference with the greatest of dignity and the greatest of skill. I am sorry he is not here this morning-his plane seems to be a little slower than mine and so he is not here at this moment.
Again thanks to all of you for coming out, distinguished citizens and everybody else. It's really great to be home. Thank you.
