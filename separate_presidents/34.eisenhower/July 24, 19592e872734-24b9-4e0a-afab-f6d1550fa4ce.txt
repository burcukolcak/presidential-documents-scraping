Statement by the President Upon Approval of Bill Amending the Mutual Security Act of 1954.
I HAVE today signed H.R. 7500, a bill amending the Mutual Security Act of 1954. Three amendments made by the bill concern disclosure by the Executive Branch of information, documents, and materials relating to the Mutual Security Program or certain of its aspects.
I have signed this bill on the express premise that the three amendments relating to disclosure are not intended to alter and cannot alter the recognized Constitutional duty and power of the Executive with respect to the disclosure of information, documents, and other materials. Indeed, any other construction of these amendments would raise grave Constitutional questions under the historic Separation of Powers Doctrine.
In this connection, I am constrained to emphasize once again that it is established policy of the Executive Branch to provide the Congress and the public with the fullest possible information consistent with the public interest. This policy will continue to guide the Executive Branch in carrying out the Mutual Security Program so that there may be a full understanding of the program and its vital importance to the national security.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 7500 is Public Law 86-108 (73 Stat. 246).
On the same day the Press Secretary to the President released the following statement concerning appropriations for mutual security:
The President is disappointed by the action of the House Appropriations Committee on the Mutual Security Bill. The accumulative cuts made are deeply below the minimums he considers necessary for the security of our nation and the free world.
The President most earnestly hopes that the ultimate action of Congress will be to restore the appropriations to the full amounts authorized.
