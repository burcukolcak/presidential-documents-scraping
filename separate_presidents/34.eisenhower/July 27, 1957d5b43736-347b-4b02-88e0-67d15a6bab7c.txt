Dwight D. Eisenhower
July 27, 1957

Statement by the President on the Death of President Armas of Guatemala.
THE TRAGIC DEATH of President Carlos Castillo Armas of Guatemala is a great loss to his own nation and to the entire free world. President Castillo Armas was a personal friend of mine. Under his leadership, the threat of Communist domination of his country was repulsed and Guatemala became a valuable member of the Organization of American States. Mrs. Eisenhower and I extend our heartfelt sympathies to the people of Guatemala and to the family of the President.
