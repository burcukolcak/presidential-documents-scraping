Memorandum to Federal Agencies on the United Fund and Community Chest Campaigns.
To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
For the voluntary support of health, welfare and recreation organizations, United funds and Community Chests will soon be making their annual appeals throughout the country and among federal civilian and military personnel. Many of these campaigns include such national charities as the Red Cross, USO, and others working to eliminate disease and secure the health of us all. This fall they will seek to raise more than $400,000,000 in a record fund-raising appeal.
We, in Government, want to assume our full share of the support of private health and welfare services. The United fund and Community Chest campaigns provide each of us with an opportunity to participate in a wide variety and number of voluntary organizations.
The Honorable Neff H. McElroy, Secretary of Defense, will serve as Vice Chairman of United Community Campaigns for the federal Government. I am sure everyone will extend full cooperation to him, and I hope the employees of your department or agency will give generously to these campaigns.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
