Message Recorded for Use in Connection With the Observance of National Vegetable Week.
I AM HAPPY to have been asked to participate in this observance of National Vegetable Week.
Nowhere else in the world are people fed so well--or in such great variety as here in the United States.
The number of different vegetables available to the average housewife insures this variety. And the huge amounts of food produced by our vegetable farmers assure people in great portions of the world that they will not go hungry.
On the personal side, it happens that I was once a small operator in the business of raising and selling vegetables.
The first money I ever earned was the result of a venture of this kind--55 years ago. From that day to this, I've felt that the production of vegetables is filled with challenge and interest. I've tried it in such widely separated places as Fort Myer, Virginia, in Europe, and in the State of Washington.
I am particularly happy, therefore, to salute the great army of American vegetable growers during this special week in their honor. My best wishes go to all of them.
