Letter to Joseph T. Meek, Illinois Republican Candidate for the Senate.
[Released July 30, 1954. Dated July 27, 1954]
Dear Mr. Meek:
Thank you very much for your letter of July twenty-third.
Since this Administration took office, it has sought to secure the enactment of a program clearly in the best interests of the people--a program assuring maximum security for the country and prosperity for every citizen. It now is apparent that most of this program will be adopted by the Congress. I am delighted to have your personal assurance that I can count on your loyalty and support in furthering this program and the objectives and purposes of this Administration.
May I say further, that I look forward with anticipation to greeting you on January third as the Junior United States Senator from Illinois.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Meek's letter of July 23 was released with the President's reply.
