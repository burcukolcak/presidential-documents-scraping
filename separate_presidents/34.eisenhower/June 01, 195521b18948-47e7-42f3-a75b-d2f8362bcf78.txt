Whereas, by joint resolution approved February 29, 1952 (66 Stat. 9), the Congress of the United States has designated the 17th day of September of each year as Citizenship Day in commemoration of the signing of the Constitution of the United States on September 17, 1787, and in recognition of all our citizens who have come of age and all who have been naturalized during the year; and
Whereasin this time of world uncertainty and unrest it is most appropriate that every one of our citizens, whether native-born or foreign-born, give special thought to the priceless blessings secured to us by our Constitution; and
Whereasthe aforesaid resolution authorizes the President to issue annually a proclamation caging for the observance of Citizenship Day with appropriate ceremonies:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, call upon the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Saturday, September 17, 1955, and urge the people of the Nation to display the flag on that day at their homes and other suitable places.
I also urge Federal, State and local officials, as well as religious, civic, patriotic, educational, and other organizations, to arrange for appropriate ceremonies on Citizenship Day, in schools and churches and other appropriate places, to the end that all of us may gain a deeper appreciation of our rights and responsibilities as citizens of the United States.
And I also call upon all our citizens to renew and reaffirm their allegiance on that day to the principles and ideals embodied in the Constitution—the foundation of our strength and the symbol of freedom and justice for all.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this first day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
