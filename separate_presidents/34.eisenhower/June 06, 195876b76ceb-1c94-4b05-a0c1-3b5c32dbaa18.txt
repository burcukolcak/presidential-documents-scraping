Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Authorizing Payment for Use of Danish Vessels in World War II.
I AM PARTICULARLY GRATIFIED that the Congress has enacted this legislation authorizing the full and final settlement of an extremely complicated problem that has been outstanding between the United States and Denmark for 17 years. It is notable that the discussions between the two countries have throughout been characterized by an unremitting desire to arrive at a mutually acceptable settlement, and by the patience and understanding traditionally characterizing relations between the United States and Denmark, its close ally.
Note: As enacted, this bill (S. 2448) is Public Law 85-450 (75 Stat. 182).
