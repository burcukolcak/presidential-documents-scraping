Dwight D. Eisenhower
June 10, 1955

Statement by the President Upon Signing the Postal Field Service Compensation Act.
I HAVE today approved the Postal Field Service Compensation Act of 1955. This Act represents the greatest forward step for our postal employees in more than a century.

The new law will bring about the elimination of inequities in the Postal Field Service which for years have violated the principal of equal pay for equal work and discouraged employees from seeking advancement. The salary plan which the measure provides for firmly establishes that principle. It will at last place the wages for postal service positions in proper relationship to each other. Incentives for advancement are finally a reality. A fair pay increase is granted to each and every employee.
The Act represents a major step in the Administration's personnel program of providing Federal employees with a salary structure and employment benefits comparable to those available in the more progressive companies of private industry.
Note: As enacted, the Postal Field Service Compensation Act of 1955 is Public Law 68, 84th Congress (69 Stat. 88).
