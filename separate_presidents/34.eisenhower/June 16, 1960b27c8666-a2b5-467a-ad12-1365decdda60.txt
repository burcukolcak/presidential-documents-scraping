Remarks in Manila Before Leaving for Taipei.
Mr. President, Your Excellencies, members of the Armed Services of the Philippines, and friends:
After this very brief visit to this beautiful country, the time has come for me to say goodbye. To you, Mr. President, and to your associates I must express the very deep appreciation of all my party and myself for your many kindnesses and many courtesies. Truly we feel that we have found in you, here in your own country, what we always knew you were when you came to see us: a true friend, a true friend personally, as friends live in affection with each other, but friends as the head of a friendly government and a friendly people--a government and people that stands with other free nations in defense of all the values that all of us hold dear.
So as we go, we don't truly go. Our memories, our hopes, and our hearts will be with you--always.
And frankly, when the burdens of my present office have been passed on to someone else, and I can become a freer man than I am now, I still nurture the hope that again I can come back here and with even less restrictions than now, wander around this land and learn it once again as I thought I knew it a quarter century ago.
Thank you, and through you I want to thank every single individual who along the street or in crowds exposed to me a friendly face and shouted a friendly mabuhay.
It has been heartwarming. And goodbye.
Note: The President spoke at 11:10 p.m. at the Presidential Landing near the Manila Hotel, following a dinner given in honor of President and Mrs. Garcia at the Chancery. The President then took a launch to the U.S.S. St. Paul, which was anchored in the South Harbor waiting to take him to Taipei.
