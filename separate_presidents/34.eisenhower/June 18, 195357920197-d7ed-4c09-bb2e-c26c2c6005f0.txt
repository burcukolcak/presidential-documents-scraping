Statement by the President on the Prevention of Forest Fires.
OUR NATURAL RESOURCES are an integral part of this Nation's strength and security. Today, more than ever before, we need to protect, rebuild and maintain our renewable resources to insure a plentiful supply of their products for the welfare of all people. The protection and wise use of our forest, range and watershed lands are a part of the Nation's responsibility to its citizens.
I am greatly concerned over the continuing heavy loss of our natural resources by forest fires, and over the fact that nine out of every ten of these fires are caused by human carelessness or thoughtlessness. It is squarely up to every American to realize that he has a definite personal responsibility in the protection of these resources.
This is the time of the year when most people, including myself, are making hopeful plans to visit our forests and mountains to enjoy the many forms of healthful outdoor recreation which they afford and which we all need for spiritual and physical well-being. If every man, woman and child will join in the nationwide drive to prevent forest fires--if each one of us will use extra care this year--we can surely cut down on the unnecessary destruction of vital resources by wildfire.
