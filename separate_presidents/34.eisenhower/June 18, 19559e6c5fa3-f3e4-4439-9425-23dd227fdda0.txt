Letter to William Randolph Hearst, Jr., Regarding His Appointment to the President's Committee for Traffic Safety and Its Advisory Council.
[Released June 18, 1955. Dated June 17, 1955]
Dear Bill:

I have learned from Harlow Curtice of your willingness to serve as Chairman of the Advisory Council to the Committee for Traffic Safety. It is gratifying to know that you will be turning your interest and broad experience in traffic problems to the urgent traffic safety program.

In extension of this, I should like to ask you, as Chairman of the Advisory Council, to serve also as an ex officio member of the Committee. By doing so, you can contribute significantly to strengthened Committee liaison with the national highway safety organizations represented on the Advisory Council. I need emphasize to you the importance of a close tie between the two groups.
I sincerely hope that you will be able to undertake this direct liaison responsibility.

With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Mr. William R. Hearst, Jr.

President
