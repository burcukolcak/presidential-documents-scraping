Dwight D. Eisenhower
June 18, 1957

Remarks to the National 4-H Conference.
FOR A LONG TIME I have been meeting with members of 4-H Clubs and the Future Farmers and I don't know of any meeting that brings to me a sense of greater satisfaction and hope.
I think people my age feel that they are at least trying to work for the future, and when I get with people of your age then I suddenly realize you are the future, and you are going to do the things that we now wish we could do. We must have faith that each generation gets better, more efficient, and I am quite positive that all of those things that you are dreaming now, and we are hoping for, you will do.
So when I see such a healthy, good-looking group of people as this, it sends my spirits up. I don't know where you could travel in the world and call together a bunch of people of any age and get a greater sense of satisfaction than I do in looking at you now.
I hope you are having a good time. I hope that not only you are finding your trip here to the Capital instructive, I hope you are finding it thoroughly interesting and enjoyable.
And by the way, just a few years from now I will be really farming in earnest, and maybe I'll call on some of you for advice. I'll need it.
Goodbye.
