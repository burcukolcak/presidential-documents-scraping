Statement by the President Upon Signing the Library Services Bill.
THE LIBRARY SERVICES BILL, which I have today signed into law, represents an effort to stimulate the States and local communities to increase library services available to rural Americans. It shows promise of leading to a significant enrichment of the lives of millions of Americans, which, I am confident, will be continued by the States when this limited Federal program comes to an end.
Note: As enacted, the Library Services Bill (H. R. 2840) is Public Law 597, 84th Congress (70 Stat. 293).
