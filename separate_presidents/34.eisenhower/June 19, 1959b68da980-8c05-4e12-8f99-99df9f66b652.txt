Statement by the President on the Rejection of the Nomination of Lewis L. Strauss as Secretary of Commerce
Last night the Senate refused to confirm the nomination as Secretary of Commerce of Lewis Strauss--a man who in war and in peace has served his Nation loyally, honorably and effectively, under four different Presidents.
I am losing a truly valuable associate in the business of government. More than this--if the Nation is to be denied the right to have as public servants in responsible positions men of his proven character, ability and integrity, then indeed it is the American people who are the losers through this sad episode.
