Remarks in Seoul Upon Leaving for Honolulu.
Mr. Prime Minister and citizens of Korea:
My all too brief stay here in Korea has for me been full of interest and inspiration. I have seen the strength and vigilance of the forces guarding an unnatural boundary which keeps Koreans in the north from their fellow countrymen in the Republic of Korea.
I have seen how free world forces from many nations are joined here together in preserving a vital frontier of freedom and in furthering the purposes of the United Nations Charter. I have had interesting and profitable discussions with Prime Minister Huh Chung and other Korean leaders. I have had the privilege of addressing your National Assembly and meeting some of its members who bear such important responsibilities in fulfilling the wishes of the Korean people.
I have had the memorable experience of seeing so many Korean people along the routes of travel I have followed. To them, and to countless numbers whom I could not see, I extend my warmest thanks for Korea's hospitality.
I regret very much that some parts of my planned route for yesterday became so greatly congested by friendly spectators that I could not ride through all of the streets where people were waiting to welcome me and my party. To them, who waited so long, I express a particular word of thanks.
I must now say goodbye to you and to your fellow countrymen. On behalf of all the members of my party, I wish to express our deep appreciation for the wonderful day we have spent here as your guests. We are profoundly grateful.
Every best wish to you and to all the people of Korea wherever they may be. And God go with you.
Note: The President spoke at 7:50 p.m. at the Kimpo International Airport.
