Memorandum on the Community Chest and United Fund Campaigns.
To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
Community Chests and United Funds all over the country will conduct their annual campaigns this fall under the designation, "United Community Campaigns." In addition to some 18,500 health, welfare and recreation organizations, these appeals will provide financial support for the United Defense Fund whose job it is to furnish USO services to the armed forces, help to communities disrupted by defense activities and relief to Korea. The goals of these campaigns will aggregate over $280,000,000. By virtue of their size and the range of their services, these campaigns are clearly of great importance.
I have assured the leaders of United Community Campaigns of the cooperation of the Federal government in their endeavors. To that end I am confident that you will extend the full cooperation of your department in each community throughout the United States and its territories and possessions where it conducts its operations. Such cooperation would logically include the assumption of equitable unit goals, the effective solicitation of all employees and the setting up of an adequate collection method for the convenience of those who wish to make contributions on an installment basis.
It is my hope that all employees will give generously keeping in mind the fact that their gifts will be used to support a number of different organizations for a full year.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
