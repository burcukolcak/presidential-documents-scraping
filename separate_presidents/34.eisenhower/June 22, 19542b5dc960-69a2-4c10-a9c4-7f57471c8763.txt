Executive Order 10538â€”Establishing a Seal for the United States Marine Corps
WHEREAS the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps with approval of the Secretary of the Navy has caused to be made, and the Department of Defense has recommended that I approve, a seal for the United States Marine Corps, the design of which accompanies and is hereby made a part of this order, and which is described as follows:
Standing upon the western hemisphere of the terrestrial globe containing the lines of latitude and topographical outlines of North, Central, and South America, an American bald eagle with wings displayed horizontally and inverted holding in his beak a scroll inscribed with the motto "SEMPER FIDELIS", all bronze. Behind the western hemisphere a foul anchor bend sinister-wise with stock, arms, and flukes in slight perspective, all bronze, on a scarlet background and within a dark blue band-edged in gold circumscribed by a gold rope rim and inscribed "DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY - UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS" in gold letters. The central device of the seal is the emblem of the United States Marine Corps;
AND WHEREAS it appears that such seal is of suitable design and appropriate for establishment as the official seal of the United States Marine Corps:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, I hereby approve such seal as the official seal of the United States Marine Corps.
