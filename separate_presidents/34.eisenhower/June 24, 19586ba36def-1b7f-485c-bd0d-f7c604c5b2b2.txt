Letter to Leo A. Hoegh, Administrator of Federal Civil Defense, on His Becoming Director, Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization.
Dear Leo:
Now that it is certain that the Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization is to be established on July first, I want to thank you for the great impetus you have given to our national civilian defense programs during the year that you have served as Administrator of federal Civil Defense. I consider it highly important that this program continue to have such experienced leadership as has characterized your service and I am delighted that you are agreeable to carrying on with this responsibility along with the others assigned to the Director of the new Mobilization Office.
This closer association of civil defense with our other mobilization programs should assure more rapid progress in fulfilling our national mobilization objectives than has been possible heretofore.
I am particularly grateful for the contribution you made to preparing the recommendations for civil defense legislation that I submitted to the Congress earlier this year, as also to the development of a comprehensive civil defense plan. Joined to the very satisfactory relationships you have established with officials of State and local governments across the Nation, these measures should provide an effective basis for accomplishing the civil defense programs essential to our national security.
I appreciate the strong support you have given to the work of the Administration thus far, and I wish you every success as you assume your new duties.

With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: On August 26 this office was redesignated Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization (Public Law 85-763, 72 Stat. 861 ).
