Remarks to Veterans Making the Last Trip on the U.S.S. Williamsburg.
I APOLOGIZE for being a bit late, but it was not intentional, I assure you.
I haven't been able, before, to come down and greet the guests of Commander Burke on the Williamsburg that makes these trips down the Potomac. I have wanted to. I couldn't
Since this is the final trip before she is deactivated, I wanted to come down and assure you that all of us--the Red Cross, and the Navy, and I--have all looked on it as a real privilege, to see if we couldn't do something to let you spend a nice afternoon up and down this historic river, on a fine ship, and through the services of the Navy.
If you have a bit of fun, more power to you. That is what it is for. We hope you will enjoy every single bit of it, and remember it kindly.
Through you, we would like to let all the others know how welcome they have been.
Now, the trip is the thing, and you didn't come down here to listen to a lot of words from me--I realize that.
I hope you will allow me to come around--particularly these lads in front of me--to say "Hello" before I go.
Note: The President spoke at the U.S. Naval Gun Factory in Washington at 12:40 p.m. During his remarks he referred to Commander Julian T. Burke, Captain of the former Presidential yacht U.S.S. Williamsburg.
