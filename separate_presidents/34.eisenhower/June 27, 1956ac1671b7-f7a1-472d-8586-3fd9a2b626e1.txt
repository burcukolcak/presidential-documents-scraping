Dwight D. Eisenhower
June 27, 1956

Statement by the President Approving New Program for Fund-Raising Within the Federal Establishment.
WE WHO WORK in the government want to assume our full citizens' share of voluntary support of the many worthwhile private health and welfare organizations.
True voluntary giving is based on the personal desire of an individual to make a private donation to a specific agency for a purpose with which he is familiar and which he wants to support.
The new program will make available to everyone in the government the opportunity to give his full measure of support to these efforts.
Note: The President's statement is the foreword to "Fund-Raising Within the Federal Establishment, Approved Policy and Program" developed with Cabinet concurrence and issued by the Office of the President's Adviser on Personnel Management. The statement was also released as part of a White House announcement of the new program.
The program calls for not more than three solicitation periods each year--only one in communities with a united fund serving all recognized agencies. Full opportunity would be provided for employees to learn about the services and needs of the fund-raising agencies. In order to ensure the principle of voluntary giving, each contributor would have the right to give selectively and to keep his gift confidential.
