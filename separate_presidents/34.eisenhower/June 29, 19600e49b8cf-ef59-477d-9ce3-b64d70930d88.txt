Letter to the President of the American Red Cross on the Nation's Voluntary Disaster Relief in Chile.
Dear General Gruenther:
Your heartwarming preliminary report of our Nation's voluntary relief efforts in Chile was on my desk when I arrived home.
The total value of cash and supplies donated by our people was most gratifying to me. It symbolizes an even greater asset: namely, the united response of Americans--of all creeds and races--to their neighbors in need.
This great outpouring of charity has served as a most human supplement to the official relief actions taken by our Government on behalf of our stricken friends in Chile. I am sure it will help them to recover from the shattering effects of disaster. This whole experience serves to strengthen the bonds of affection and respect which unite our two countries.
I would like to make an additional comment about one section of your report which carried particular promise. That was the part dealing with the needs of the 80,000 stricken school children of Chile and the major effort by our young people on their behalf. I am proud that the youth of America are demonstrating their concern for these children. This is further proof that our best traditions are in good hands!
With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: General Gruenther's preliminary report was enclosed in a letter to the President dated June 14, 1960. The report outlined the activities of each of the voluntary agencies participating with the American Red Cross in the relief effort.
In his letter General Gruenther stated that the response of the American people to the President's appeal for aid to the victims of the Chilean earthquake had been very gratifying, and that, as of July 24, the total value of cash and supplies contributed was nearly $4,500,000.
The letter and the report (9 pp., mimeographed) were released with the President's reply.
