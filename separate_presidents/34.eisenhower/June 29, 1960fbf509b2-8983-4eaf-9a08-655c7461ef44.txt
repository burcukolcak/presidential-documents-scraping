Whereasthe Congress, in recognition of the importance of the wool industry and the part it plays in our national economy, has by a joint resolution approved June 29, 1960, requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the month of September 1960 as National Wool Month:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the month of September 1960 as National Wool Month; and I urge the people of the United States to observe that month with appropriate activities and ceremonies.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
