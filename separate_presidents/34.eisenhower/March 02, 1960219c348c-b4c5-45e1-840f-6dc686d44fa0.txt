Remarks Upon Receiving a Medal From the President of the Departmental Council of Montevideo.
Mr. President, Mr. Mayor, and members of the City Council of Montevideo:
It is indeed a very great honor that you do me to give me this medal as a symbol of the medal of honor of Montevideo. It is indeed a unique occasion.
To stand here in the shadow of this obelisk, a memorial to constitutional government, in a country that worships--venerates the doctrines of Artigas, one of the great champions of liberty and freedom of all time, this is an occasion that warms the very depths of my heart.
I could only say that this medal, if ever earned at all, has been earned by the people of the United States, who with the people of Uruguay have been champions of freedom, have worked for freedom, have been ready to sacrifice for freedom. And no stronger bonds could hold together two people more firmly.
So, sir, as I thank you, the citizens of Montevideo--as a matter of fact, all Uruguay--I do so as one who believes in exactly the same sentiments that you have just expressed concerning liberty, independence, and human dignity.
Thank you.
Note: The President spoke at the obelisk at approximately 3 p.m. His opening words "Mr. President, Mr. Mayor" referred to President Nardone and Daniel Fernandez Crespo, President of the Departmental Council of Montevideo.
The medal, which was presented by Mr. Crespo, bears the inscription "Homenaje de Montevideo, El Concejo Departamental al Presidente Dwight Eisenhower."
