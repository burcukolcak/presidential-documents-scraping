Dwight D. Eisenhower
March 02, 1960

Remarks Upon Receiving a Medal Presented by the President of the General Assembly.
Mr. President:
I am most grateful for this medal. I have only one regret, that the message that I delivered to your Congress was not so eloquent as I could have wished in expressing the true affection that the United States has for Uruguay, and the feeling of brotherly comradeship with them that we always cherish.
Could I have put those thoughts in the proper words, they would have been more valuable. But I do thank you very much.
Note: The medal was presented to the President by Senator Raffo at a reception immediately following the President's address to the National Congress (Item 80). The inscription reads "El Poder Legistivo al Presidente Dwight Eisenhower, 2 March 1960--Republica Oriental del Uruguay."
