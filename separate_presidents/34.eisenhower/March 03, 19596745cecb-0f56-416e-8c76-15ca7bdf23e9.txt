Letter to T. Keith Glennan, Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Following the Launching of Space Probe Pioneer IV.
Dear Dr. Glennan:
The successful launching early today of the space probe, Pioneer IV, marks yet another major step in scientific space exploration. The scientific information that is being sent back by its instruments should provide important additions to man's knowledge of the universe.
Please convey my warm congratulations for this splendid achievement to all who contributed to it in your own agency, in the Army, and among your scientific associates.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
