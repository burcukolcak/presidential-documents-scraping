Dwight D. Eisenhower
March 10, 1955

Remarks to Students Attending the International School of Nuclear Science and Engineering, Argonne National Laboratory.
Admiral Strauss and gentlemen:
It is a very great pleasure to have a part in welcoming you to America and to your entry in the Argonne School.
During World War II, we got into the habit of referring to ventures in terms of operations, Operation "This" and "That." In war, of course, it usually had a martial name.
I can't tell you how pleased I was to hear this project referred to as "Operation Friendship." That is exactly what we mean.
We want you to study in the friendliest of atmospheres, and go back to your country with the certainty that what you are carrying back is not only a new understanding in nuclear science and reactor engineering, but a new understanding of the friendship that all America feels toward each of your countries.
It will be a great personal favor to me if when you do go back, in addition to all of the things that you hope to accomplish in this new field, you will carry my personal greetings of friendship to everyone that you meet in your own countries.
Now, I have been told that Admiral Strauss and I are to have the privilege of shaking hands with each of you. As you go by, I would particularly like to have each of you give me your country's name as well as your own.

Good luck to each of you.
Note: The President spoke in the Rose Garden at 9:30 a.m. to students from 19 countries who were members of the first class attending the International School of Nuclear Science and Engineering. The School was inaugurated in March 1955 at the Atomic Energy Commission's Argonne National Laboratory at Lemont, Ill., as part of the atoms-for-peace program.
The President's opening words referred to Lewis L. Strauss, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission.
