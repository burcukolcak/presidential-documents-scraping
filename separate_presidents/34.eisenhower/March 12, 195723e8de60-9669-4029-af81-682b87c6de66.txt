Message to His Majesty Paul I, King of the Hellenes, Commemorating a Decade of Greek- American Cooperation.
[ Released March 12, 1957. Dated March 11, 1957 ]
Your Majesty:
I am delighted to convey to you my greetings on the occasion of the anniversary of a decade of Greek-American cooperation in the interest of security and economic progress.
Ten years ago, Greece was fighting bravely for its very existence against the onslaught of communist imperialism. I acclaim Greek achievement in winning that struggle and then repairing the devastation it had caused, and in continuing to play an important part in the defense of the free world.
I am proud that Greece and the United States have stood together during this difficult period. The partnership of our countries is a striking example of the way in which free nations working together can contribute to the peace and security of the international community.

Most respectfully,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
