Letter to Frederick M. Eaton, U.S. Representative to the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference in Geneva.
[Released March 12, 1960. Dated March 11, 1960]
Dear Ambassador Eaton:
The ten nations which will begin disarmament discussions at Geneva on March 15, 1960, have both the opportunity and a great responsibility to serve mankind. The interest of the United States in disarmament and my own strong personal feelings on this subject are well known. I want to take this opportunity to emphasize that the United States is prepared to explore every possible avenue to find a way toward general disarmament.
We must not be pessimistic because of the lack of success in past disarmament negotiations. Nor should we necessarily expect immediate, dramatic and far-reaching strides, although we would certainly welcome such progress. Rather, it should be our objective in these negotiations to contribute by carefully balanced, phased and safeguarded arms control agreements to the ultimate objective of a secure, free and peaceful world in which international disputes will be settled in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.
As the United States Representative to the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference, I know that you will exert every possible effort to reach agreement on measures which will lessen the danger of another armed conflict, ease the burden of armaments and thereby contribute to the attainment of the ultimate goal of general disarmament and a peaceful world. I should like you to convey to the other delegates at the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference my earnest hope that the Conference will discharge its solemn obligation to mankind and thus contribute to this goal.
You may be assured that you carry with you my complete support and that of the people of the United States.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
