Letter to Governor Quinn Certifying to the Enactment of the Hawaii Statehood Bill.
Dear Governor Quinn:
In accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of Public Law 86-3, I am very happy to certify to you the fact that I approved the law today, March 18, 1959.
As you start the procedure that will, I hope, result in the admission of Hawaii into the Union as a State on equal footing with the other States, you and the people of Hawaii have my very best wishes.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
