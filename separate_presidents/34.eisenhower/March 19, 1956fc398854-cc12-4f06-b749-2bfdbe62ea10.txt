Letter to Prime Minister U Nu on Receiving Gift of Burmese Teak.
[Released March 19, 1956. Dated March 7, 1956]
Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I recall with pleasure your visit to the United States last summer and the friendly chat we had wherein I expressed my admiration of teak, one of the most famed products of your great forests. Now, your thoughtful gift of ten tons of Burmese teak has arrived at the White House.
I have entrusted the timber to the White House cabinetmakers and I am certain that they will be able to put this magnificent wood to use in beautiful ways that will serve to symbolize the enduring friendship between our two countries.
May I express to you, Mr. Prime Minister, my deep appreciation and that of the American people for this considerate gesture.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
