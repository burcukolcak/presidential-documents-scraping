Letter to Secretary Benson on Accelerating Construction Programs of the REA.
Dear Mr. Secretary:
In accordance with the policy announced in my statement of March 8, 1958, of accelerating, where feasible, construction programs under existing appropriations and authorizations, you are directed to take the following steps with respect to the Rural Electrification Administration loan programs:
1. Encourage REA borrowers to accelerate necessary construction of electrification and telephone facilities under already approved loans. I am informed that there is a total of some $740 million of balances available but not yet used under previously approved loans. Since these funds would be used for needed facilities, it may be possible for cooperatives and other borrowers to move forward the time at which orders are placed with manufacturers of materials and equipment under these programs.
2. Encourage additional facilities loans to finance farm and rural home installations for electrical services, and the purchase of electrical appliances and other equipment. funds are presently available under the REA program which can be used to finance such installations and purchases by consumers. Additional purchases of facilities, where needed for improved farm and family living, would be of special benefit to the economy at this time.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
