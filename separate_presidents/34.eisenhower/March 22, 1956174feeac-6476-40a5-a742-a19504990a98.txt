Letter to President Mirza of Pakistan on the Occasion of the Celebration of Republic Day.
[Released March 22, 1956. Dated March 20, 1956]
Dear Mr. President:
On the occasion of Pakistan's establishment as a Republic within the Commonwealth, I send my greetings and best wishes, as well as those of the people of the United States, to you and through you to the people of Pakistan. The United States will be represented at the attendant ceremonies by the United States Ambassador to Pakistan and by a Special Representative, the Honorable Jefferson Caffery, one of our most distinguished citizens.
The inauguration of Pakistan's constitution represents an important milestone in Pakistan's development as a modern, democratic state, responsive to the needs and aspirations of its people. The long efforts of Pakistan's leaders in drafting a constitution based on democratic principles have culminated in well-deserved success. Because of the close ties of friendship between our countries, the people of the United States are particularly happy to send expressions of good will on this memorable day in Pakistan's history.
I am confident that under your inspiring leadership Pakistan will continue to make progress in advancing the welfare of its people.
May I express my good wishes for success in these worthy endeavors.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
