Statement by the President on Releasing the Science Advisory Committee's "Introduction to Outer Space."
IN CONNECTION WITH a study of space science and technology made at my request, the President's Science Advisory Committee, of which Dr. James R. Killian is Chairman, has prepared a brief "Introduction to Outer Space" for the non-technical reader. This is not science fiction. This is a sober, realistic presentation prepared by leading scientists.
I have found this statement so informative and interesting that I wish to share it with all the people of America and indeed with all the people of the earth. I hope that it can be widely disseminated by all news media for it clarifies many aspects of space and space technology in a way which can be helpful to all people as the United States proceeds with its peaceful program in space science and exploration. Every person has the opportunity to share through understanding in the adventures which lie ahead.
This statement of the Science Advisory Committee makes clear the opportunities which a developing space technology can provide to extend man's knowledge of the earth, the solar system, and the universe. These opportunities reinforce my conviction that we and other nations have a great responsibility to promote the peaceful use of space and to utilize the new knowledge obtainable from space science and technology for the benefit of all mankind.
Note: The statement prepared by the President's Science Advisory Committee is published in "Introduction to Outer Space" (Government Printing Office, 1958).
On March 27 a White House release announced that the President had approved several projects for launching a number of small unmanned space vehicles, to be carried out by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense. Programs authorized would include scientific earth satellites and lunar probes.
