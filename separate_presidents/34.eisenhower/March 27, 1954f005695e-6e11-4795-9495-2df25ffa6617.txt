Letter Accepting Resignation of Joseph M. Dodge as Director of the Bureau of the Budget.
[Released March 27, 1954. Dated March 2, 1954]
Dear Joe:
I must, of course, respect your wish to leave governmental service after so many years devoted to it. I cannot in conscience ask you to reconsider in view of the reasons you give for your decision. But I assure you that it is only with the greatest reluctance that I accept your resignation as Director of the Bureau of the Budget.
Your services during these past fourteen months in office have been invaluable to the country. Your competence and knowledge in an exceedingly difficult field have immeasurably helped solve the gigantic fiscal and management problems that have faced this Administration. On the more personal side, I shall sorely miss your advice, counsel and your friendly helpfulness. In fact, I have every intention of imposing upon you from time to time to give me your thoughts and opinions on some of the knotty questions that will continue to arise.
In thinking back over the governmental positions you have been called to fill since the beginning of World War II, I am struck by the fact that not only has each been an important one but most of the assignments have been almost on an emergency basis. In each your reputation for .efficiency and dedication to the public good has continued to grow. As a consequence, you will leave behind you in the government service a host of admiring friends; I know that each of them would join me now in wishing for you the greatest of happiness and success in the years to come.
With warm personal regard,
As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: In his letter of resignation Mr. Dodge referred to his work in revising the original 1954 budget and to his intention, known to the President, of resigning soon after the 1955 budget was presented to the Congress. His letter was released with the President's reply.
