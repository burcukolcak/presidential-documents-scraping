Whereasthe disease of cancer takes the lives of nearly a quarter of a million of our citizens every year, many of whom are at the peak of their achievements; and
Whereasa democratic Nation which cherishes the life of the individual does not stand idly by in the face of such a challenge; and
Whereasthe will of this Nation to conquer cancer has been well attested by the work of public and private agencies alike—work which must continue to enlist support and participation by all of us if this disease is to be controlled; and

Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1954 as Cancer Control Month; and I invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to issue similar proclamations. I also urge the medical profession, the press, the radio, television, and motion-picture industries, and all interested agencies and individuals, to unite during the appointed month in public dedication to a program for the control of cancer.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 31st day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-eighth.
