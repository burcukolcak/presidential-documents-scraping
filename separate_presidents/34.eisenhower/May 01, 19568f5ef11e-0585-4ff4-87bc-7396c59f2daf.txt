Statement by the President: Armed Forces Day.
EACH YEAR on the third Saturday in May, the Armed Forces of the United States, including the Reserve components and auxiliary services, make a special effort to increase public understanding of our national defense program which is, and has been from the beginning of our Republic, dedicated to achieving and maintaining peace.
In the present world situation, it is most important that our own people, and others throughout the world who believe as we do, should be cognizant of all aspects of our national strength-the spiritual and the moral, as well as the material and the military--and be reminded of our continuing efforts for peace.
The purpose of Armed Forces Day is to increase public understanding of, and to emphasize, our peaceful aspirations. I hope that all Americans, as well as many of our friends in other lands, will accept the invitation to visit our Armed Forces at this time.
