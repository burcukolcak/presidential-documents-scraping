Statement by the President on the Dust Bowl Emergency.
LAST WEEK, at my invitation, the Governors of Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas met the representatives of interested Departments and Agencies of the Federal Government to discuss remedial action in connection with the dust bowl emergency.
The Governors attending that conference expressed their approval of legislation to make additional Federal funds available to supplement state efforts directed at alleviating the wind erosion problem.
In order that prompt action may be initiated in this critical situation, I am today authorizing the allocation of $10,000,000 from the President's Disaster Relief Fund to the Secretary of Agriculture. This will enable the Federal Government to move swiftly in aiding the dust bowl area pending final Congressional action in this matter. The revised version of S.J. Res. 144, now before House and Senate conferees on the Third Supplemental Appropriation Bill, has been worked out in cooperation with the Senators and Governors of the states affected by this serious wind erosion.
I have been gratified by the teamwork evident during these discussions. This kind of cooperation will contribute significantly to a speedy and effective attack on this menacing problem.
