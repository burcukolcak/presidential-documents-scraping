Remarks of Welcome to Sir Winston Churchill at the Washington National Airport.
Sir Winston:
This is a great honor indeed to welcome you once more to the United States. I do so not only as my dear friend of wartime days but as one who is, after all, half American himself. We think it is only fitting that you should come and visit this country which--after all--claims at least the maternal side of you.
So, welcome again, and we do hope you enjoy your trip here to this country.
Note: Sir Winston responded as follows:
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am most happy once again to set foot in the United States--my mother's country. I always think of it and feel it.
I have come here on a quiet visit to see some of my old comrades of wartime days. I am indeed sorry that the brevity of my stay makes it impossible for me to go to Canada or to see as many of my friends as I should like.
I always love coming to America. But I shall not say, as most people who are traveling nowadays about the world seem to do, everything I think.
It will suffice me to thank you all for your welcome, and to bring you the assurance of our lasting friendship.
