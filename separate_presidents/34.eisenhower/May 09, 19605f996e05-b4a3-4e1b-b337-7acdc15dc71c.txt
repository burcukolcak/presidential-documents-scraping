Letter to Syngman Rhee Upon His Withdrawal From Political Life in Korea.
[ Released May 9, 1960. Dated May 5, 1960 ]
Dear Dr. Rhee:
The vastness of the events which have taken place in Korea has claimed the attention of the entire world. I can assure you that no one has followed them with more anxious sympathy than I.
With your voluntary withdrawal from political life, I am reminded ever more strongly of how much your country will remain in your debt. The rebirth of Korea in 1945 was the fruition of your long years of patient and arduous labor. Your tenacity and indomitable courage at a time when the Republic was the prey of Communist armies won the admiration of the entire Free World as well as the gratitude of all Koreans. Since then, under your guidance, Korea has recovered from the deepest wounds of that conflict and is today a monument to your life-long work.
I cannot but feel that your decision, momentous as it is, is yet another example of wisdom as well as selfless service. I assure you that the United States will continue to feel itself bound by strong ties of sympathy to Korea under your successors.
My best wishes for many years of health and happiness in the honored retirement which you have done so much to earn.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
