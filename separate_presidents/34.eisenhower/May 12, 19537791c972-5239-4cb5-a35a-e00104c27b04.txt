The Honorable, The Lord Ismay

Secretary General, North Atlantic Treaty Organization

Palais de Chaillot, Paris, France
Pursuant to the request of the North Atlantic Council that I nominate an officer of the Armed Forces of the United States for appointment by the Council as SACEUR to succeed General Matthew B. Ridgway, I hereby nominate General Alfred M. Gruenther. I feel that General Gruenther is peculiarly well qualified to perform the duties of Supreme Commander. Since the beginning of the N.A.T.O. he has given unselfishly of his services in the cause of providing an adequate defense of the N.A.T.O. area. It is my belief that the confidence expressed by the member nations in his appointment as Chief of Staff, SHAPE, make him an outstanding officer.
As Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, I feel the fine traditions and worthy objectives sought by all the nations will be upheld and carded forward through the leadership of General Gruenther.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
