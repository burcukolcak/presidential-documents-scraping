Letter to Admiral Carney Regarding His Nomination as Chief of Naval Operations.
[Released May 12, 1953. Dated May 9, 1953]
- Dear Admiral Carney:
By the attached papers I seek your relief from the position of Commander-in-Chief, South, to permit your appointment at my direction as the succeeding Chief of Naval Operations.
The selection for this appointment is based on the finest traditions of the Naval Service which you have eminently displayed throughout your career. I know that you will regret leaving your present assignment. However, it is in the best interest of the United States that you should bring your long experience in naval matters, and most importantly, your N.A.T.O. experience to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Department of the Navy.
I am seeking early resolution of this matter of your relief from N.A.T.O. in order that you may have adequate time to prepare for your transfer of functions.
Let me give you every assurance of my personal satisfaction in making this appointment.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
