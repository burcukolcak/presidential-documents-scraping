Letter to General Ridgway on His Service as Supreme Allied Commander, Europe.
[Released May 12, 1953. Dated May 9, 1953]
- Dear General Ridgway:
Please accept my personal congratulations on the magnificent performance you have made as SACEUR. The matter of your relief will be a disappointment to our European allies, but I trust they will appreciate the equal importance of your new task.
I am seeking an early resolution to the problem of your relief in order that ample time will be available in the necessary transfer of functions.
You have my confidence as the newly appointed Chief of Staff, U.S. Army. You will bring to that service the fine traditions and leadership you possess. The difficult task ahead rests in good hands.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
General Matthew B. Ridgway

Supreme Allied Commander, Europe
