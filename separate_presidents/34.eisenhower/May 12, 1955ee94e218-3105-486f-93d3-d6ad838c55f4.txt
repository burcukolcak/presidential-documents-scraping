Message Recorded for Use in Conjunction With Observance of Armed Forces Day.
My friends here at home and overseas:
We Americans have constantly pledged that we will never permit aggression. But we must always be prepared to defeat it. On May 21st the Armed Forces of the United States will hold "open house" to give our own and other peace-loving people the best possible opportunity to see how ready we are, in military terms, for any threat to our security or to the peace of the free world. As Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States I earnestly hope that all who can will accept this invitation to become better acquainted with the armed components of our National power for peace.
