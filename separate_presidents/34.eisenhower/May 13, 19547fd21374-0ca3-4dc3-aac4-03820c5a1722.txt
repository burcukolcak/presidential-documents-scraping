Remarks Upon Signing the St. Lawrence Seaway Bill.
I AM VERY HAPPY, in the presence of this distinguished company, to sign this bill.
I think it is particularly fortunate that we have with us the Ambassador from Canada, because this bill is intended to set in motion the great project which will operate to the benefit of both our countries.
This marks, of course, the legislative culmination of an effort that has taken 30 years to reach this point. Now work can begin on the great project itself. That work, we all hope, will progress rapidly without interruption to a successful completion, so that the benefits of this great project can come to all our people on both sides of that great river.
Note: The President signed the bill in the Conference Room at the White House. Among those present were Canadian Ambassador A. D. P. Heeney, Senator Homer Ferguson of Michigan, Senator Alexander Wiley of Wisconsin, and Representative George A. Dondero of Michigan.
The St. Lawrence Seaway Bill is Public Law 358, 83d Congress (68 Stat. 92).
