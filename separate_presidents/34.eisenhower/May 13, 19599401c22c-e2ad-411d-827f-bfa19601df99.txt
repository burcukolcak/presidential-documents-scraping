Remarks at the Semiannual Conference of State Civil Defense Directors
I CAME in to get a chance to thank each of you for what you have been doing, in a responsibility that is one of the serious ones resting upon the Nation.
I am particularly pleased with the legislation that makes us partners, the Federal Government with the States and localities, well recognizing that the main responsibility for implementation of responsibility rests with the locality which is to be protected.
But just to thank you for taking part in a responsible job is not quite enough. This is the job that means the greater assurance for America of its security--our national security. It is a very essential part of our security arrangements and activities. And it is because of my great concern about this that I am anxious to receive you.
Now, having thanked you collectively, Governor Hoegh says that I may have the opportunity of meeting each one of you so that I can say thanks to you in person as you come by. And I assure you again that my appreciation of your work and my recognition of its importance could not be deeper.
Note: The President spoke in the Conference Room at 11:45 a.m. In his closing remarks he referred to Leo A. Hoegh, Director, Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization.
