Message to President Koerner of Austria on the Signing of the Treaty Restoring Austrian Independence.
[Released May 15, 1955. Dated May 13, 1955]
THE AMERICAN people join me in rejoicing with you and the Austrian people on the historic occasion of the signing of the treaty restoring Austrian independence. This moment of supreme satisfaction to Austria, for which we Americans have worked so diligently, would not have been possible without the staunch determination of the Austrian Government and its citizens and their devotion to democratic principles.
The conduct of the Austrian people during the ten long years they have labored under the heavy burden of foreign occupation has commanded the profound respect of all the American people. I am confident that the many ties which bind our two peoples together will continue to constitute the basis for ever friendly relations between Austria and the United States.
As a country dedicated to the fundamental principles of freedom and liberty, the United States will ever maintain an interest in the independence of Austria. The American people are proud and happy at the prospect of Austria being able to play her full part in world affairs with dignity, self-respect, and freedom.
Note: The President's message was presented to President Theodor Koerner by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles on May 15 in Vienna.
