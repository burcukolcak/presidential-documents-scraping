Remarks Upon Arrival at Orly Airport in Paris
ONCE AGAIN I am privileged to come to France, this beautiful France, to salute a great people and their leader. I have come here to join with the leaders of France, Great Britain and the Soviet Union in discussions of historic importance.
The American Government's participation is undertaken not to seek any advantage at another's expense; rather it hopes to prove equally with any other its sincere dedication to peace with justice.
Mankind knows that the effects of nuclear war would be not only horrible but universal. Mankind expects the participants in this summit meeting to work honestly and intelligently for measures toward genuine peace.
The hopes of humanity call on the four of us to purge our minds of prejudice, and our hearts of rancor. Far too much is at stake to indulge in profitless bickering. The issues that divide the free world from the Soviet bloc are grave and not subject to easy solution. But if goodwill exists on both sides, at least a beginning can be made. The West, I am sure, will meet Mr. Khrushchev halfway in every honest effort in this direction. America will go every foot that safety and honor permit.
It will be a pleasure to meet again with my old friends President de Gaulle and Prime Minister Macmillan. I hope to meet another friend, Chancellor Adenauer, this afternoon. I have talked with all three of these leaders in recent weeks, and we have had opportunity to discuss the issues before us. Unity on great principles and purposes strengthens the Western powers as the eyes of the world turn towards Paris. I pray that the grace of God will be with us to direct our efforts so that progress toward a just peace may be achieved.
