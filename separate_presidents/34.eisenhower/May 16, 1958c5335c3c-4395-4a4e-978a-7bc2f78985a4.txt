Letter to Carl Vinson, Chairman, House Committee on Armed Services, on the Defense Reorganization Bill.
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I have just been shown your Committee's revision of the defense reorganization legislation which I sent to the Congress two months ago. from a quick reading I have these impressions:
First, on the whole the bill clearly reflects constructive efforts to correct the main difficulties which have troubled our defense establishment in recent years. I congratulate you and your Committee colleagues for the progress made toward developing a sound defense structure.
Second, by and large the bill seems to deal positively with every major problem I presented to the Congress.
Third, in certain respects--two quite important--I believe that changes would make the Committee's revision clearer in intent and more clear-cut in effect within the Defense Department, and therefore would result in greater departmental and operational efficiency. I am requesting a member of my staff to give you my views on such items. I hope this language will be suitably adjusted on the House floor.

With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
