Memorandum to Federal Agencies on the United Givers Fund Campaign in the National Capital Area.
[ Released May 16, 1960. Dated May 14, 1960 ]
To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
This fall, the United Givers Fund will conduct its fifth annual Campaign in the National Capital Area. Nearly 150 local and national agencies in Washington and nearby Maryland and Virginia--providing vitally needed health and welfare services to our community--will seek our voluntary support during this Campaign.
Among the agencies that benefit from our gifts are the six area chapters of the American National Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the Family Service Associations, the Boy and Girl Scouts, the Mental Health Associations and other health agencies, and the USO. Scores of others provide Child Care, Care for the Aged, Hospital and Medical care and many other services to meet human needs.
I am happy to announce that the Honorable Robert B. Anderson, Secretary of the Treasury, has accepted the chairmanship of the Government Unit for the 1960 United Givers Fund Campaign. I know that all Government personnel in the Washington area will want to join with him in making this fund-raising effort an outstanding success.
