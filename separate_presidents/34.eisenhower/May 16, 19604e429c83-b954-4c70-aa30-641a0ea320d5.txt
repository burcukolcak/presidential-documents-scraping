Statement by the President Upon Signing the Mutual Security Act of 1960
I HAVE SIGNED into law the Mutual Security Act of 1960.
I am highly gratified by the action of the Congress on this measure. The Act embodies essentially all of the requests I have put forward as necessary for the successful continuation of the Mutual Security Program, and, with one regrettable exception, the Congress has resisted the addition of amendments which would adversely affect our foreign relations or impair the administration of the Program.
I believe it is impressive that, after extensive and searching hearings on the bill conducted by the authorizing committees of both Houses, the Congress concluded that substantially all of the funds requested are necessary for carrying forward important economic aspects of the Program. The same high degree of responsibility and regard for our national interests will, I trust, result in not only the full sums now authorized for certain economic programs but also in the full appropriations which I have requested as necessary to provide for the Development Loan Fund and the Military Assistance Program.
NOTE: The Mutual Security Act of 1960 is Public Law 86-472, signed by the President on May 14 (74 Stat. 134).
The statement was released in Washington.
