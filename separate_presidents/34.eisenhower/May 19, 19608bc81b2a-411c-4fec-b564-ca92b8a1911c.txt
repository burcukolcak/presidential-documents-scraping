Remarks at Orly Airport, Paris, Before Leaving for Lisbon.
AGAIN I HAVE the opportunity to say adieu to France. I share the disappointment of my colleagues that because of our inability to convene the Summit Conference, we could make no progress toward easing the tensions that so plague mankind. But I equally share their confidence that because of this setback we of the Western Allies, particularly France, Britain, and the United States, both through their governments and through their people, are joined even closer than before in their determined pursuit of peace with justice in the world.
And so now I say, or express my deep gratitude to the people of France who have made our stay here so enjoyable personally and who have been so generous in their extension of courteous hospitality. It is a lovely country that I hope in the coming months and years to visit often.
Thank you all very much.
