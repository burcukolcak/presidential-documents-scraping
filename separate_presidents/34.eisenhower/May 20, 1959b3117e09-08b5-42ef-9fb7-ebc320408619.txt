Proclamation 3294—Redefining the Boundaries of the Allegheny, George Washington, and Jefferson National Forests

Whereasit appears to be in the public interest to redefine as hereinafter indicated the exterior boundaries of the Allegheny National Forest in the State of Pennsylvania, established by Proclamation No. 1675 of September 24, 1923 (43 Stat. 1925), the George Washington National Forest in the States of Virginia and West Virginia, established by Proclamation No. 2311 of November 23, 1938 (53 Stat. 2499), and the Jefferson National Forest in the States of Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia, established by Proclamation No. 2165 of April 21, 1936 (49 Stat. 3506):
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 24 of the act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1103, as amended (16 U.S.C. 471), and the act of June 4, 1897, 30 Stat. 34, 36 (16 U.S.C. 473), and upon recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, do proclaim (1) that the exterior boundaries of the aforementioned national forests shall be located and defined as set forth in the descriptions, and as shown on the diagrams, attached hereto and made a part hereof; (2) that all national-forest lands within those boundaries are hereby reserved as parts of the respective national forests within which they are located; and (3) that all lands within those boundaries which may hereafter be acquired by the United States for national-forest purposes shall, upon acquisition of title thereto, be reserved as parts of the respective national forests within which they are located.
The Massanutten Section (Virginia) of the George Washington National Forest, as described herein, is hereby designated as the Robert Fechner Memorial Forest. Executive Order No. 8673 of February 5, 1941, designating the Massanutten Unit of the George Washington National Forest as the Robert Fechner Memorial Forest, is modified accordingly.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 20th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
