Dwight D. Eisenhower
May 20, 1960

Remarks at Portela Airport, Lisbon, Before Leaving for Washington.
Mr. President, and all citizens of this lovely and friendly country:
First of all, Mr. President, will you permit me a word of congratulations to the Armed Services for the beauty and character of the arrival and departure ceremonies. Never have I seen any more impressive than this.
Twenty-four hours is far too short a time to spend in your lovely country. As in my visit here in 1951, I have been impressed by the beauty of Portugal and by the friendliness and hospitality of the Portuguese people. Equally impressive are the signs of real progress. Today I saw whole communities which in my visit in 1951 did not exist.
Brief as this visit was, I believe it has been productive of many useful results. My talks with President Thomaz and with the President of the Council, Dr. Salazar, have been conducted in a spirit of complete mutual understanding. All of us realize that we are united in a common cause and that each of us, in his own way, shares a part of the responsibility of striving for a peaceful and better world. Moreover, our talks together have once again affirmed the spirit of friendship and good will that has always characterized the relations between Portugal and the United States.
The time has come to say goodbye. It is with the greatest reluctance that I take my leave after this pleasant stay with you.
But in the name of the American people, I salute the Portuguese nation, its distinguished leaders, and its wonderful, warm-hearted citizens. My deepest gratitude and thanks go to all who have made this visit so pleasant and memorable.
Note: The President spoke at 9:40 a.m.
