Statement by the President on the Report of the President's Science Advisory Committee, "Education for the Age of Science.
THIS REPORT makes clear that the strengthening of science and engineering education requires the strengthening of all education. As an excellent statement of educational goals and needs, I hope it will be widely read and that it will stimulate a wider understanding of the importance of excellence in our educational system.
One subject discussed in the report warrants special emphasis--the importance of raising the standing of our teachers in their communities. Higher salaries are a first requirement, but we need also to recognize the great importance of what teachers do and to accord them the encouragement, understanding, and recognition which will help to make the teaching profession attractive to increasing numbers of first-rate people.
