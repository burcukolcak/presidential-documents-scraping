Statement by the President on the Armistice Negotiations at Panmunjom.
THE ATTENTION of the free world is focused upon the armistice negotiations at Panmunjom. There, on May 25, the United Nations Command renewed its efforts to bring an honorable peace to Korea and a fair and humane settlement of the POW issue. To speed these negotiations the United Nations Command requested executive, in other words confidential, sessions. We are continuing to observe the executive nature of those sessions.
There are, however, certain principles inherent in the United Nations Command position which are basic and not subject to change. No prisoners will be repatriated by force. No prisoners will be coerced or intimidated in any way. And there must be a definite limit to the period of their captivity. The procedures used in handling the prisoners must reflect these principles.
In all this, our allies are in full accord. These principles accord also with the prevailing view of a representative bipartisan group of Senators and Congressmen who have been consulted.
Finally: These principles on which we stand are the same as those which were formally approved by fifty-four members of the United Nations.
