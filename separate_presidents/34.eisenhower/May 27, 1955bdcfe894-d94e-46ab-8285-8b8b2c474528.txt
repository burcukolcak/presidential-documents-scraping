Statement by the President on Safe Driving.
I URGE every American to take maximum care for safe driving on this Memorial Day weekend and during the following period of heavy summer traffic. I am joined in this request by Harlow Curtice, Chairman, and the members of the President's Committee for Traffic Safety as well as--I am sure--every motorist in our nation.
Throughout the nation there is now beginning an exceptional effort to "Slow Down and Live" on our highways. I know that this program will have the full attention and complete support of all our citizens so that we may accomplish a great and continuing reduction in the number of deaths and injuries on our roads.
There can be no matter of greater urgency for all of us than insuring the safety of our families and fellow citizens.
