Statement by the President Upon Signing the Treasury-Post Office Appropriation Bill for 1958.
I HAVE approved H. R. 4897, the Treasury-Post Office Appropriation Bill for 1958, although, after allowing for certain increases in expenses, such as retirement contributions, within-grade increases, and so forth, required by law to be paid, it provides less funds for operations of the Post Office Department for fiscal year 1958 than were appropriated for 1957.
While the Post Office Department will continue to make every effort to operate economically, it is dear, in view of the rising volume of mail, that the appropriations for the Post Office Department will be insufficient, unless postal services are to be substantially curtailed beginning July 1, 1957.
To enable the American people to continue to receive the postal service to which they are entitled, I shall submit to the Congress shortly a request for supplemental appropriations for the Post Office Department for fiscal year 1958.
Note: As enacted, H. R. 4897 is Public Law 85-37 (71 Stat. 35).
