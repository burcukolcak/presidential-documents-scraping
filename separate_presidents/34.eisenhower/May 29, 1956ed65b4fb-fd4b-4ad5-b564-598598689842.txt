Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Extending the Sugar Act of 1948.
I HAVE TODAY approved H. R. 7030, to amend and extend the Sugar Act of 1948, as amended, and for other purposes.
In addition to extending the Sugar Act for four years, the bill restores to the domestic areas the right to supply 55% of this country's increased requirements of sugar. The amendments also permit foreign countries to supply as much as they have been, plus 45% of the increases in our requirements. These increases will be most important relatively for the countries that heretofore have been minor suppliers.
It was not considered feasible to recommend an increase in the Philippine quota at this time. I believe, therefore, that when new amendments are being prepared at the conclusion of the present Act, consideration should be given to allowing the Philippines to share in increased consumption, as is now provided for other foreign countries by this bill.
Note: As enacted, H. R. 7030 is Public Law 545, 84th Congress (70 Stat. 217).
