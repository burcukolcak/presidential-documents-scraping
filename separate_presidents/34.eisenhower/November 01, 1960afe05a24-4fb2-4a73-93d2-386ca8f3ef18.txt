Statement by the President Concerning the Agreement Reached in the Railway Industry.
A LANDMARK in the history of labor-management relations in the United States--
Both sides for many years have been concerned about the problems deeply affecting the livelihood of the men who run the trains and the future of the industry itself. I am sure the American people applaud as I do the high principle which has brought railway labor and management together in this agreement which adds greatly to the substance of the fabric of our free enterprise system.
Certainly this agreement is living proof that free collective bargaining is successful if left in the hands of dedicated, capable men who desire to see it work. It is also another indication of the maturity that has been achieved in industrial relations in this country in recent years.
Note: The President's statement was made on the occasion of the signing of Executive Order 10891 "Establishing a Commission to Inquire Into a Controversy Between Certain Carriers and Certain of Their Employees" (25 F.R. 10525). Representatives of the railroads and of the five railway operating brotherhoods had agreed to submit their dispute over work rules and practices to a Presidential commission on which the unions, the carriers, and the public would be represented.
For statement by the President announcing the appointment of members of the commission see Item 378.
