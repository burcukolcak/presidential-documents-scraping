Exchange of Messages With President Lopez Mateos Concerning the Cyclone Disaster in Mexico.
[ Released November 2, 1959. Dated October 30, 1959 ]
Dear Mr. President:
I was shocked to learn of the cyclone, floods and landslide that are reported to have caused such havoc and loss of life in the vicinity of Manzanillo. The American people extend heartfelt sympathy to the Mexican people in this trying time. Although Ambassador Hill has already been in touch with officials of your Government, I want to inform you personally that this Government stands ready to cooperate in any manner it can in alleviating the hardships now being borne by the citizens of Mexico.
With warm personal regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: President Lopez Mateos' reply, dated October 31, follows:
Highly Esteemed Mr. President:
I have received with sincere emotion the message in which you convey to me your regret over the havoc caused by the Pacific cyclone in a vast region of the Republic.
In name of the Mexican people, I deeply appreciate this evidence of solidarity which the people of the United States manifests to us in these unfortunate moments.
In the midst of the loss of lives and the destruction which the disaster has brought us, this government is controlling and progressively dominating the situation, and you may be assured that we shall not fail to remember the cooperation of our friends in case of need.
I send you affectionate greetings, with my cordial consideration.
ADOLFO LOPEZ MATEOS
