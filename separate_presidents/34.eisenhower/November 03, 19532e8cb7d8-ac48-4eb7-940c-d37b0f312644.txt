Statement by the President: American Education Week.
To the Patrons, Students and Teachers of American Schools:
The celebration of American Education Week summons the thoughtful attention of every American citizen.
The youth of our Nation--who are the future of our Nation-are the hope and the test of freedom itself. In homes, farms and factories--in the schools, senates, and churches of the next generation-the youth of today will tell by their deeds the fate of those values which, cherished by the free through centuries, have given life and dignity and purpose to our own America.
This--nothing less--is the measure of the task served by the teachers of our Nation today. Such a responsibility demands not only essential and elaborate material paraphernalia: buildings, endowments, salaries, laboratories. It demands, above all else, strength and perception of heart and of mind.
Our teachers are summoned to be patriots in the highest sense of the word: to teach the principles that bring freedom and justice to life; to make clear that enjoyment of liberties means acceptance of duties; and to impart the priceless knowledge that duty, in an age of peril, means sacrifice.
Our whole citizenry is summoned to help the teachers in their great work: not only to provide them with the resources they need, but also to guard with devoted vigilance the freedom of thought and discussion which inspire free men to teach all men how to be free.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
