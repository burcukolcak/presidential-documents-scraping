Telegram on the Dedication of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters New Building.
Mr. Dave Beck, General President

International Brotherhood of Teamsters,

Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America

Washington, D.C.
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has erected in our Capital a magnificent building to serve the growing needs of a growing union. It is fitting that this structure be built in the Capital of a free Republic which accords to Labor and its representatives their equal and rightful place in its social and economic life.
Strong, dedicated, democratic trade unionism is one of the bulwarks of our American way of life. Our democracy and our economy both make possible and draw strength from free trade unions.
To the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, its officers and members, I extend my best wishes on the dedication of their new

home.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
