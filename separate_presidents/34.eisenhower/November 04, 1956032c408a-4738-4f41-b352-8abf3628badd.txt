Dwight D. Eisenhower
November 04, 1956

Statement by the President Following Secretary Dulles' Operation.
I KNOW I SPEAK for all Americans--and for freedom-loving peoples the world over in wishing the Secretary of State a speedy and full recovery from his operation.
As Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles has devoted himself unselfishly to his complicated and strenuous duties--even, as it is now apparent, at the risk of his own health. He has given untiringly of himself to the cause of world peace based on justice and, as such, is my invaluable associate.
Until he can resume his full duties, the splendid State Department staff, headed by Herbert Hoover, Jr. that the Secretary has developed--will operate in his stead. In doing so, they, and I, will constantly have the advantages of his experience, wisdom and courageous spirit.
