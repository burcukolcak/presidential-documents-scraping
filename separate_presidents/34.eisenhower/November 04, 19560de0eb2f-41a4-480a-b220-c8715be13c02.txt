[Released November 4, 1956. Dated October 30, 1956]
Dear Mr. Cummings:
It is most gratifying to my associates and me to have your account of satisfactory dealings with the Small Business Administration. I shall see that Administrator Barnes knows of your approval.
Thank you very much for this piece of evidence that our endeavors to be helpful to small business have met with some success.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Cummings' letter of October 18 was also released. He informed the President that he owned a small grocery and that he had tried without success to obtain a loan at the bank. Turning to the Small Business Administration, he stated that he had received prompt, courteous attention to all his letters. "I had the feeling that the biggest businessman in the country couldn't receive better treatment than I got."
