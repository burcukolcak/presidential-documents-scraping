Statement by the President on the Use of Soviet Forces in Hungary
I feel that world opinion which was so uplifted only a few days ago by the news that the Soviet Union intended to withdraw its forces from Hungary has now suffered corresponding shock and dismay at the Soviet attack on the peoples and Government of Hungary.
I met today with the Secretary of State at Walter Reed Hospital and later with the Acting Secretary of State, some of his staff, the Director of Central Intelligence Agency, and some of my staff to discuss the ways and means available to the United States which would result in:
1. Withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary.
2. Achieve for Hungary its own right of self-determination in the choice of its own government.
I have sent an urgent message to Premier Bulganin on these points.
There was likewise a thorough review of the Middle East situation and the measures now under way in the United Nations to restore peace in that area and to lay the groundwork for constructive solutions of its problems.
Note: For message to Premier Bulganin,see Item 291.
