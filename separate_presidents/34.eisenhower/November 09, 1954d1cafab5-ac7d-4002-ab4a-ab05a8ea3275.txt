Remarks to a Representative Group Receiving Citizenship Papers on Veterans Day.
WELL, I can almost say "my new fellow citizens": It is really a privilege to welcome you, not only to all of the rights and the freedoms that go with American citizenship, but to remind you--as you already know--that it has very serious obligations.
We expect you to carry on the obligations just as you enjoy the rights and the privileges. That is what every good citizen does. You are following in the footsteps of millions that have come before you, to build this country--of intermingling races and bloods and cultures. You will add your part to this great Nation that we call America.
Through you, I would like to extend my very warm greetings, my very sincere welcome, to all the fifty thousand who--with you--on Armistice Day will take the formal oath of allegiance to the United States.
I wish that I could be with you on that date, because I know it will be very significant to you.
Thank you very much for coming and giving me a chance to say hello to you.
Note: The President spoke in the Rose Garden at 11:25 a.m.
