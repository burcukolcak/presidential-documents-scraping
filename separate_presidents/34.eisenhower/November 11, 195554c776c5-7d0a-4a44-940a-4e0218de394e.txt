Dwight D. Eisenhower
November 11, 1955

Remarks on Leaving Denver, Colorado.
My friends:
Again it is time for Mrs. Eisenhower and me to say goodbye to Denver after a summer's stay. This time we leave under somewhat unusual circumstances. As you know, I have spent some time in the hospital. Such a time is not wholly a loss.
Misfortune, and particularly the misfortune of illness, brings to all of us an understanding of how good people are.
To General Griffin, the staff at Fitzsimons, the medical staff, the nurses, the clinical technicians, the enlisted men--all of the people that even clean out the hospital: my very grateful thanks, because they have done so much, not only to take care of me, but to make my stay as pleasant as possible. They are devoted people.
In the same way, here at this Post, General Sprague and his staff have taken on an additional and extra load, and have done it cheerfully and in a way to earn my eternal gratitude.
Then, Mrs. Eisenhower and I have both been touched by the volume of messages that have come in--telegrams and letters and flowers and gifts. And finally we have been especially grateful. for the knowledge that over this country and over the world friends have sent up their prayers for a sick person.
So I leave with my heart unusually filled with gratefulness, to Denver, to the people here, to the locality--in fact to everyone who has been so kind.
And I hope that those people who have sent in messages--and Mrs. Eisenhower has not been able to reach them all; she did her best--that they will know, through this little talk, that we are eternally thankful to them.

Goodbye and good luck.
Note: The President spoke at the airport, Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Colo., at 8:44 a.m. In his remarks the President referred to Maj. Gen. Martin E. Griffin, Commanding General of Fitzsimons Army Hospital, and Maj. Gen. John T. Sprague, Commander of Lowry Air Force Base.
