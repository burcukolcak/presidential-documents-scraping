Letter to Secretary Mueller Concerning Participation in the New York World's Fair of 1964-65.
My dear Mr. Secretary:
It will be desirable to give early consideration to the advisability of participation by the United States in the New York World's Fair to be held in New York City in 1964 and 1965. It is also desirable that preliminary consideration be given to the character and scope of any such participation.
It is accordingly requested that the Secretary of Commerce take the lead in considering the question of Federal participation in the New York World's Fair and present to me his recommendations thereon not later than January 1, 1961.
In connection with the carrying out of the foregoing assignment, it is requested that the appropriate Federal agencies be consulted. I suggest that you consult the Departments of State, Treasury, Agriculture, the Interior, Labor, and Health, Education and Welfare, the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, the United States Information Agency, and the Housing and Home Finance Agency.
Expenditures arising in connection with the above shall be paid from the appropriation appearing under the heading "Special Projects" in Title I of the General Government Matters Appropriation Act, 1961 (Public Law 86-642; 74 Stat. 473-474).
I am sending a copy of this letter to the head of each of the foregoing agencies.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
