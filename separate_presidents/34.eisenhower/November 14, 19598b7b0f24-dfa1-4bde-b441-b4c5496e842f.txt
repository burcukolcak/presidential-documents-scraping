Message to Prime Minister Nehru of India on the Occasion of His 70th Birthday.
Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I am particularly delighted, on this occasion of your seventieth birthday, to send my congratulations and best wishes for continued health and long life.
This important milestone in your career offers me the opportunity to felicitate you on your many accomplishments during the long service that you have devoted to India and its people. Your leadership over many years, especially in the office of Prime Minister, has inspired your own people as well as millions outside of India. Through your writings, moreover, you have shared with others, including many Americans, your appreciation of India's noble past and the bright hope of its future.
Although any man could well be proud of this record of achievement, I know that your thoughts are not directed to the past but to the present and the future. You have devoted your life to the realization of a just and peaceful world order; but many problems remain to be solved before this goal can be reached.
I am looking forward to seeing you in a few weeks.
With warm personal regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
