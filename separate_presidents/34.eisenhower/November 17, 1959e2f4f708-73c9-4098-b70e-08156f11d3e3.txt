Dear Mr. President:
I have been most happy to learn that you will stop one day in Ankara on your way to India on December 6, 1959. You may be assured that this news will be received with deep satisfaction by the whole Turkish nation.
Although the schedule of your trip does not, unfortunately, allow you to prolong your stay here, it will be, nevertheless, for us a real pleasure to meet you again and to talk to you, be it only for a short time. Let me add that I am, of course, aware of the meaning of your trip, which constitutes a new proof of the great efforts which you display for the strengthening of the solidarity between the free nations and the realization of the ideals of peace and security.
Expressing, again, my happiness at the prospect of meeting you very soon on this occasion, I remain, with my best regards,
Yours sincerely,
CELAL BAYAR
