Dwight D. Eisenhower
November 18, 1958

Message Read at the Dinner of the National Urban League in New York City,
AS AMERICANS we believe that all men are created equal. Our national existence began with this belief and it is the foundation of our democracy. We must continue to build on this foundation, so that each citizen is free to enjoy the fruits of his own individual effort apart from those which may accrue to his fellow citizens and community. We must continue to make this right of individual effort more fully and widely shared. We must continue to strengthen and enlarge the opportunities of our people to develop and utilize their God-given talents for their own sakes and for the common good.
I shall continue to work with all the skill, patience and influence which I can command to advance these time-honored principles of American equality and justice.
On this day, it is a privilege to send my personal congratulations to you and to every citizen across the land who is helping to ensure for our Nation and for the world the sacred traditions of justice, freedom, and equal opportunity for all men.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
