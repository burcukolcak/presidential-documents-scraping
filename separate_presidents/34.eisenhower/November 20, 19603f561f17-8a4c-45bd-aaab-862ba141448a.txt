Statement by the President on Making Public a Report by the Science Advisory Committee.
[Released November 20, 1960. Dated November 17, 1960]
THIS REPORT is part of a continuing study by my Science Advisory Committee of ways in which the Federal Government can best assure the strength and progress of American science, one of our essential resources for national security and welfare. I hope it will be favorably received and widely studied by everyone in our national community concerned with the advancement of scientific knowledge through basic research and with the education of young scientists.
I call particular attention to the conclusion of the Science Advisory Committee that the process of basic scientific research and the process of graduate education in universities must be viewed as an integrated task if the nation is to produce the research results and the new scientists that will maintain the leadership of American science. In this great endeavor, the partnership between the Federal Government and the nation's universities will assume growing importance in the future.
Note: The report "Scientific Progress, the Universities, and the Federal Government," dated November 15 (33 pp., Government Printing Office, 1960), was prepared by a special Panel on Basic Research and Graduate Education of the President's Science Advisory Committee.
The President's statement was issued as part of a White House release which also included a summary of the panel's conclusions and of its recommendations by Dr. George B. Kistiakowsky, Chairman of the President's Science Advisory Committee, together with his letter to the President submitting the report.
This statement was released at Augusta, Ca.
