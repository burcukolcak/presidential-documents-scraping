Executive Order 10850—Modifying the Exterior Boundaries of Certain National Forests in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and South Carolina
WHEREAS certain areas of land chiefly in private ownership were included within the exterior boundaries of certain national forests in the States of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and South Carolina, in anticipation of acquisition of such lands by the United States for national-forest purposes, pursuant to section 7 of the act of March 1, 1911, 36 Stat. 962, as amended (16 U.S.C. 516); and
WHEREAS, because of changes in land use and for other reasons, it is no longer desirable that such lands be acquired for national-forest purposes, and they may properly be excluded from the exterior boundaries of the national forests; and
