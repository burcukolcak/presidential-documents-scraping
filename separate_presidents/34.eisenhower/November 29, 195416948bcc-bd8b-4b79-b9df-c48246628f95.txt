Message to Sir Winston Churchill on the Occasion of His 80th Birthday.
The Right Honorable Sir Winston Churchill

K.G., O.M., C.H., M.P.

The Prime Minister

London, England
Dear Winston:
I know I speak for my fellow countrymen as I enthusiastically do for myself, in sending you warmest congratulations on reaching a new landmark in a life that is in itself a series of great landmarks.
We Americans have known you and of you over the years--as roving war reporter, as adventurous soldier, as administrator and parliamentarian and, increasingly with each passing year, as statesman and defender of freedom.
We have seen the great Anglo-American partnership grow and flourish with you as one of the staunch advocates. In the dark times of war, and the anxious ones of uncertain peace, this partnership has sustained us all and given us strength.
Now, as you reach four score, we Americans salute you as world statesman, as unconquerable warrior in the cause of freedom, as our proven friend of many valiant years.
With warm personal regard,
As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
