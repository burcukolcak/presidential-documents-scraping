Statement by the President in Support of Red Cross Disaster Appeal for Relief in Hungary and to Hungarian Refugees in Austria.
I URGE ALL AMERICANS generously to support the special Red Cross Disaster Appeal for $5 million to aid in emergency relief both in Hungary and to Hungarian refugees in Austria.
The conditions of disaster and privation which require this emergency relief have been accurately described from day to day publicly by our news-reporting media. Amidst all their trials, the courage of the Hungarian people has been an inspiration to all freedom-loving peoples the world over.
By contributing to the Red Cross emergency campaign, each of us individually can express our sympathy and admiration for the brave Hungarian people.
Note: Released with this statement was a telegram from E. Roland Harriman, Chairman, American Red Cross, outlining the conditions requiring an immediate appeal for funds. The statement and the telegram were released at Augusta, Ca.
