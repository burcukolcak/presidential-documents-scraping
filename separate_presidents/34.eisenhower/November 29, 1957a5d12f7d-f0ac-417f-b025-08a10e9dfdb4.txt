November 29, 1957

Letter to Dr. Howard L. Bevis in Response to the Report of the President's Committee on Scientists and Engineers.
Dear Dr. Bevis:
I note with satisfaction the record of accomplishment of your Committee as set forth in its Second Interim Report. It presents a clear picture of the large problems that confront us in building the Nation's potential in science and engineering, and it makes pertinent suggestions for action to help solve these problems.
It is my hope that the organizations whose leaders comprise the Committee, as well as others concerned with these questions, will now use the competent guidance provided by the report and plan and undertake such action as may be appropriate to their aims.
I am grateful to you and the Committee for your devoted service and continuing fruitful efforts.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The Committee was established on April 3, 1956, to coordinate private and non-Federal efforts to meet the growing needs for scientific and engineering manpower. The Second Interim Report outlined major actions taken to meet both short-range and long-range problems in this field. The report approved October 4, 1957, and transmitted to the President on November 26, was printed and made available by the Committee.
