Exchange of Messages Between the President and Prime Minister Nash of New Zealand.
Dear Prime Minister:
Thank you for your two letters of October tenth, and particularly for your renewed invitation to visit New Zealand as the guest of your Government. Such a visit would, I can assure you, be a source of happiness to Mrs. Eisenhower and me, for we have often wished to see your beautiful country and to get better acquainted with the people of New Zealand. Since we have made no plans for the period after I leave office, I can unfortunately make no commitment in this regard, but I most sincerely appreciate your kindness in renewing this gracious invitation.
With warm personal regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Only one of the two letters from Prime Minister Nash, dated October 10, was released with the President's reply. Its text follows:
My dear Mr. President:
May I again reiterate the personal invitation that I extended to you during my last visit to Washington to come to New Zealand as the guest of the Government of New Zealand. Any time that you and Mrs. Eisenhower feel that you have the time available and would like to come down to the South Pacific we will take particular care to ensure that your visit is of interest and it would we hope bring you and Mrs. Eisenhower much joy and happiness in visiting a smaller country which, for many years, has had very happy relations with the great United States of which you have been in charge for the last eight years.
With kind personal regards and all good wishes to Mrs. Eisenhower and yourself,
I am,
Yours sincerely,
WALTER NASH
