Remarks to State Directors of Civil Defense.
I SUGGESTED that I get the opportunity to say a word to you. Not that I can add anything to your own realization of your work, but I can assure you of something about the attitude of the Federal Government toward you. We are quite well aware of its importance, and we are certainly determined to support you.
Please don't get discouraged when you feel no visible progress. It is awfully hard to awaken people to a sense of responsibility without trying to create hysteria--which we certainly don't want to do. It is awfully hard to awaken people to a sense of responsibility that produces a steady and periodic work or effort.
We must be real leaders. We must never be discouraged. So no matter what happens, no matter what things look like at the moment, please keep going. As far as I can see, it is only through persistence, through continuing to achieve those things in which we believe, that we can finally continue to, one, give ourselves that confidence that comes from the maximum preparation on our own part; and second, have a finer influence, if we are confident, for bringing about a basis for the solution of the world's problems, because we can talk calmly from a position of strength, a feeling of safety and not of hysteria. That is what we are trying to get into our hearts and minds--a sense of the realization not only of the dangers, but our own strength to balance it, and our ability to meet it.
Now I feel I am the last one ever to minimize your difficulties, but also I feel the last one to admit you are not Americans. I don't believe Americans give up in the face of difficulties. That is my story today. Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke in the Rose Garden at the White House.
