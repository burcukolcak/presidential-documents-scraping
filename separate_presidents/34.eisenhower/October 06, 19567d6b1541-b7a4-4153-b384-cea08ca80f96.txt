Message to the Newspaperboys of America.
[ Released October 6, 1956. Dated October 2, 1956 ]
To the 600,000 Newspaperboys of America:
On this day, set aside to recognize one of the Nation's largest groups of young businessmen, I am glad to send greetings to the newspaperboys of America.
You boys perform a valuable service for your neighbors but I know your work is done to mutual advantage, with profit for you in both immediate and long-range terms. As newspaperboys today, you have a great opportunity to gain the experience which can make you the leaders of tomorrow.
Your constant willingness to help in many community activities throughout the year is already a sign of your growing maturity and sense of leadership. The strength of our American community life depends upon the voluntary services of thousands of citizens like you.
Best wishes for your success and happiness in your continuing service to our communities and Nation.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
