Statement by the President on the Death of√ø J. Percy Priest.
THE CONGRESS of the United States and the people of the nation have lost a valuable member in the sudden passing of J. Percy Priest of Tennessee, Majority Whip of the House of Representatives. A former teacher and newspaperman, Congressman Priest has served with distinction in the House for sixteen years. Mrs. Eisenhower and I join with his many friends in Washington and the people of his District and State in extending our sympathy to his family.
