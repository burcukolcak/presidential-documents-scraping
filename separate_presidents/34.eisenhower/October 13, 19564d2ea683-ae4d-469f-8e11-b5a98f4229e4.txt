Remarks Following the Television Program on Eve of the President's Birthday.
[Broadcast from the Library in the White House]
MY FRIENDS, I cannot tell you how deeply touched my family and I are tonight to know that Mr. Percy and Miss Dunne have arranged this tremendous party for us. We are grateful to all the entertainers that took part in making this such a wonderful evening.
More than this, we are grateful to every single person who turned out this evening to join in this party for me and for my family.
We are also deeply grateful that so many Americans have signed their names that they are determined to do their duty this fall in determining the course of America, and are going to get their friends to do the same.
I cannot remember any birthday that has been quite so deeply meaningful to me as this one.
I thank all of you--Mr. Percy and Miss Dunne particularly, for being the chairmen of this great evening.
Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 10:30 p.m. from the White House Library at the end of a special half-hour birthday television program arranged by Charles H. Percy and Irene Dunne, co-chairmen of the National Ike Day Committee. Portions of the program originated in Hollywood, Calif., Denison, Tex., Abilene, Kans., New York City, and Washington.
