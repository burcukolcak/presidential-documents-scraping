Memorandum on Occupational Safety in the Government Service.
[Released October 14, 1954. Dated October 11, 1954]
To the Heads of all Departments and Independent Agencies:
I am very much concerned with the problem of injuries to Federal workers. The suffering and the wastage of both human and financial resources caused by accidents in the Government service constitute an urgent challenge. This Administration is determined to do everything possible to reduce the rate of such accidents.
While some agencies and departments have shown improvement in their accident record, a greater effort in this respect is essential to efficient operation. I am, therefore, requesting the head of each Government department and agency to review the accident experiences and the safety program of his organization and to take all necessary steps to reduce accidents.
The Federal Safety Council has recommended an annual Presidential safety citation to the agency or department which makes the greatest progress in accident prevention. I have approved this recommendation and have advised the Secretary of Labor to proceed with the necessary arrangements. I have also asked him to provide or arrange for assistance to all departments and agencies in the development, organization, and maintenance of effective accident prevention programs and to report to me from time to time on the progress made.
