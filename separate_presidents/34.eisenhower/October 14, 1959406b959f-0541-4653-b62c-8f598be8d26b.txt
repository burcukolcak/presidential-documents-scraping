Statement by the President: National Newspaper Week.
To the Newspapers of the Nation:
It is a pleasure to take part in the twentieth annual observance of National Newspaper Week.
"Your Newspaper . . . Freedom's Textbook" is a fine theme for this year's observance. To me, it stands for the hopes and achievements of American journalism. As our editors report the daily affairs of their communities with zeal and accuracy, they help to supply our citizens with the lessons of history, together with the information which is required to make history move steadily forward in the direction of freedom and justice.
I am delighted to add my best wishes for the success of National Newspaper Week.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
