Dwight D. Eisenhower
October 14, 1960

Statement by the President: National Newspaper Week.
To the Newspapers of the Nation:
It is a privilege to join in the annual observance of National Newspaper Week.
"Your Newspaper--freedom's Guardian" is a timely theme for 1960. This is the year of our national elections, and it is a year of great decisions in lands around the world.
In our newspapers, we expect to find an accurate, responsible and lively source of public information. We live in an "open society" and by reporting the news accurately and promptly to us, our reporters help to keep it open. At the same time, we live in a threatening world where news can be distorted and exploited by the enemies of freedom. So for freedom's sake our newspapers, too, must be zealously guarded by the sentinels of truth and vigilance.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
