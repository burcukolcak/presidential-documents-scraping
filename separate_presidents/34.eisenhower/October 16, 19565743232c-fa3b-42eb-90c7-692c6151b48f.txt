Dwight D. Eisenhower
October 16, 1956

Remarks Upon Arrival in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
THANK YOU. Thank you very much for coming out. You could not pay anyone a greater compliment than just to come out and meet him with such a bright face. It looks to me like I haven't seen quite as much happiness in a long time--and you don't know how good that makes me feel.
I am here for just a couple of hours, and I am going to stop in St. Paul, Minnesota. I am going to try to see as many people as I can, and then I will be on my way.
But I want you to know this: Every time I come back to Minnesota, I feel like I am coming back to friends. Never have I run into anything here except the greatest of kindness, hospitality and cordiality.
And I will tell you this: My Mamie and I both like it.
Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at the Wold-Chamberlain Airport at 11: 10 a. m.
