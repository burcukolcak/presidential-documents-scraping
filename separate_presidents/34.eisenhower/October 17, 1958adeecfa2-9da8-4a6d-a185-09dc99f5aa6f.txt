Whereasthe food and fiber produced on our farms and ranches are the raw materials which are used by vast segments of our industry, business, and commerce; and
Whereasit is important that there be continued mutual understanding among those who produce this bountiful supply of farm products, those who process these products, and those who consume them; and
Whereasmutual understanding of the needs, problems, and opportunities of rural and urban citizens contributes to the maintenance of the internal strength of our Nation; and
Whereasthe Congress, by a joint resolution approved September 2, 1958 (72 Stat. 1741), has designated the week beginning November 21 and ending November 27, 1958, as National Farm-City Week, and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for suitable observance of that week:
