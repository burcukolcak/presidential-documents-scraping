Remarks of Welcome to President Tubman of Liberia.
Mr. President:
It is a very great privilege to welcome here the Head of the Liberian nation in which, since the founding of your government, our countrymen--our people--have taken a very deep and abiding interest.
And we are delighted that you have found it possible to pay here a courtesy visit, so that we can assure you again of our friendly feelings toward your country.
Note: The President greeted President Tubman on the North Portico of the White House at 5:00 p.m. President Tubman responded as follows:
I thank you, Mr. President, and I assure you that the government and people of Liberia are highly honored by this gesture of your regard and consideration of them.
The ties of friendship that have existed between us, that have characterized our two countries for the past--more than a century, shall continue in ever increasing measure in kind.
