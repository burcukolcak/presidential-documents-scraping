Toast to President Ruiz Cortines of Mexico at a Luncheon Before the Dedication of the Falcon Damon the Rio Grande.
Mr. President and friends from both sides of this international boundary:
I speak for all the citizens of my own country here present when I express to you, Mr. President, our tremendous satisfaction that you have honored us with this personal visit.
For your country, this country has only sentiments of friendship, of pride, and esteem. And those sentiments we express to you because you are the embodiment of your country: its official, its social, its political leader.
So, speaking not only for those here present, but I assure you, Mr. President, for all of that great body of our citizens who would like to be here but who cannot be here today, as we go to engage in this joint ceremony on the River, for all of them I say to you: may long life, health, and happiness be yours, and may the relationships between your country and mine be those only of friendship.
And for myself I say: I am proud that today I have been able to form a new personal, valuable friendship with you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, may I ask all of you to rise and with me drink a Toast to the President of Mexico.
Your good health
Note: The President proposed this toast at 2:08 p.m. at a luncheon held near the site of the dam. See also Items 222 and 223.
