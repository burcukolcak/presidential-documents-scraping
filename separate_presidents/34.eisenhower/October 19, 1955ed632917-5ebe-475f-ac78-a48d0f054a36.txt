Statement by the President on the 14th Anniversary of the Civil Air Patrol.
THROUGH fourteen years the volunteers of the Civil Air Patrol, by their almost daily performance of aerial search and rescue, mercy missions and disaster relief, have added immeasurably to the safety and well-being of their fellow citizens.
Beyond that, more than fifty thousand teen age members of CAP engaged annually in its program of aviation education help answer the continuing need for alert young men and women in our Air Force and in our aviation industry.
The volunteers of the Patrol by their patriotic service, their readiness for every call, their devotion to duty have earned the gratitude of the Republic.
I heartily endorse the Civil Air Patrol and urge all of our citizens to support this worthy organization. I join with my fellow Americans in congratulating the members of CAP upon their Fourteenth Anniversary.
