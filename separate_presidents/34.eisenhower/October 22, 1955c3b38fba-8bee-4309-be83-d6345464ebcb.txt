Letter to the Vice President Concerning the Conference on Equal Job Opportunity.
[Released October 22, 1955. Dated October 21, 1955]
Dear Dick:
Please convey to the participants in the Conference on Equal Job Opportunity on October twenty-fifth my very best wishes.
I am keenly interested in the benefits the nation will draw from this exchange of experiences and ideas--and I will be anxious to have your report on it.
We must find ways of assuring to every American that in his search for employment he will be judged on the basis of his character and his ability, and not on the basis of his race, his religious faith, or the land from which he or his forbears came to America.
With the help of the men who will be at the Conference, I am certain we will make truly significant progress.

With warm regard,

As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The Vice President served as Chairman of the Conference, which was held at the Shoreham Hotel, Washington, D.C.
