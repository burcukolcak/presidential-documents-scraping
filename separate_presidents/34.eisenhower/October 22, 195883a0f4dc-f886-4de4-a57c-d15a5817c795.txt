Dwight D. Eisenhower
October 22, 1958

Remarks to the National Safety Council, Chicago, Illinois.
Mr. Chairman and Ladies and Gentlemen
This evening I have been doing a bit of politicking, but your Chairman was kind enough to invite me in for a moment as I went back to my hotel, with the idea that he knew I would want to say to you a word of thanks and appreciation for the work you do in preserving human values and human life in this country.
I can't imagine any more important work, any more challenging work, and I would truly like to be sufficiently eloquent to express the feelings of the American people to those who give of their time, their effort and their substance to help our great country to be stronger and safer--who belong, in short, to the National Safety Council.
So, with this word of thanks for the warmth of your greeting, and for the work you are doing, I shall now say good night and be on my way.

Goodbye.
Note: The President spoke at the Conrad Hilton Hotel at 9:40 p.m. His opening words "Mr. Chairman" referred to Walter F. Carey, Chairman, Board of Directors of the Council.
