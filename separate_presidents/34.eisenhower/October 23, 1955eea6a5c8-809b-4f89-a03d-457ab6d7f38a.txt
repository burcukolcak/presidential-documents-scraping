Letter to the Vice President and the Cabinet Regarding the Task of Secretary Dulles at Geneva.
[Released October 13, 1955. Dated October 19, 1955]
Dear Dick:
I want to say a word to you, and through you to my Cabinet associates, about the task which Foster Dulles will be assuming at Geneva. As head of the American Delegation he will be carrying a heavy load of responsibility, not only as Secretary of State, but as my personal representative having my complete confidence and with whom I have continuous close understanding.
This second meeting at Geneva was one of the steps toward solving world problems which Foster and I planned together, and which we have talked over fully not only before my illness but twice since.
I hope that each one in Government will do whatever he can to make Foster's task easier. The Secretary of State must have the discretionary authority which is needed if there is to be effective negotiation and the spirit of conciliation which I have called for at that meeting. He must be the one who both at the conference table and before the world speaks with authority for our country.

With warm regard,

As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
