Statement by the President on the Developments in Hungary
The United States considers the development in Hungary as being a renewed expression of the intense desire for freedom long held by the Hungarian people. The demands reportedly made by the students and the working people clearly fall within the framework of those human rights to which all are entitled, which are affirmed in the Charter of the United Nations and which are specifically guaranteed to the Hungarian people by the Treaty of Peace to which the Governments of Hungary and of the allied and associated powers, including the Soviet Union and the United States, are parties.
The United States deplores the intervention of Soviet military forces which under the Treaty of Peace should have been withdrawn and the presence of which in Hungary as is now demonstrated, is not to protect Hungary against armed aggression from without, but rather to continue an occupation of Hungary by the forces of an alien government for its own purposes.
The heart of America goes out to the people of Hungary.
