Dwight D. Eisenhower
October 25, 1958

Statement by the President Concerning Suspension of Nuclear Weapons Tests.
ON AUGUST 22, 1958, the United States declared its willingness, in order to facilitate negotiations for the suspension of nuclear weapons tests and establishment of an international control system, to withhold testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons for a period of one year from the beginning of these negotiations on October 31. The sole condition for this voluntary one-year suspension is that the Soviet Union should not itself conduct tests during this period.
The United Kingdom has similarly declared its willingness to suspend tests. It thus lies with the Soviet Union to decide whether on October 31st all countries which have tested nuclear weapons will have voluntarily suspended testing.
The United States regrets that the Soviet Union has not accepted the offer of the United States and the United Kingdom, although we still hope that it will do so.
