Statement by the President on the Death of Cardinal Mooney.
THE UNITED STATES and the world has lost an outstanding servant of God in the passing of Edward Cardinal Mooney, Archbishop of Detroit.

Cardinal Mooney was always a tremendous force for good. His influence was not confined to his church alone. It extended to all who believed in the spiritual worth of the individual and in the brotherhood of man.
He was my warm personal friend and I, like many others in our nation, shall miss him very much.
