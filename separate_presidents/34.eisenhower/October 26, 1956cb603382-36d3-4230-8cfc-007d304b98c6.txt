(a) A strip of land 100 feet wide, lying 50 feet on each side of the surveyed base line for the location of the Watauga Hydro-Cranberry transmission line, the base line being described as follows: Beginning at survey station 61+78 where the base line crosses that course in the boundary line of Tract No. 38 which has the bearing and distance N. 61° 38' E., 1,757 feet, said point being 15.8 feet east of U.S.F.S. corner No. 41; thence along the following bearings and distances:

S. 5° 55' W., 2,395 feet to survey station 85+73.0;

S. 0° 55' W., 1,822.8 feet to survey station 103 + 95.8;

S. 48° 11' E., 804.2 feet to survey station 112+00.0;

S. 53° 03' E., 787.7 feet to a point where there is an equation in stationing on the base line survey, survey station 119+87.7 on the line back of this point being equal to survey station 121+82.0 on the line ahead;

S. 64° 05' E., 3,051.8 feet to survey station 152 + 33.8;

N. 29° 40' E., 4,390.4 feet to survey station 196+24.2;

N. 74' 40' E., 3,933.0 feet to survey station 235+57.2;

N. 57° 40' E., 6,212.8 feet to survey station 297+ 70.0;

S. 59° 13' E., 205 feet to survey station 299+75 at a point in that course of the boundary line of Tract No. 38 which has the bearing and distance S. 30° 10' E., 263 feet. the said point being 97 feet south of the 18-inch black oak tree at the north end of the said course.
The transmission line crosses Tract No. 38 between the following listed survey stations: 61+78 and 62+50, 72+85 and 82+27, 113+45 and 113+60 (approximate), 116+40 (approximate) and 117+76, 182+02 and 186+83, 191+95 and 219+97, 233+70 and 299 1-75.
(2) A perpetual easement and right of way, consisting of the right, at any time and from time to time, to construct, operate, maintain, repair, rebuild and replace one or more electric power distribution lines and appurtenances on, over, across, and under a strip of land 30 feet wide lying 15 feet on each side of the center line of an existing electric power distribution line, the center line of the said strip being described as follows: Beginning at a point in the west boundary of Tract No. 25A and in the center line of the said power distribution line approximately 100 feet north of the southwest corner of the said Tract No. 25A; thence in a general northeasterly direction approximately 1,795 feet to a pole at the top of a ridge on a peninsula of the described tract; thence in a southeasterly direction approximately 415 feet to a point where the center line crosses the southwest boundary of Tract No. 25A; together with the right to clear said strip and keep it cleared, and the right to install and maintain anchors and to cut and remove danger trees outside said strip.
(3) A perpetual easement and right of way, consisting of the right to construct, operate, maintain, repair, rebuild and replace an existing electric power distribution line on, over, across, and under a strip of land of necessary width to insure safe operation of the electric power distribution line, the center line of the said strip being described as follows: Beginning at a point in the east boundary of Tract No. 37 and in the center line of the existing electric power distribution line at or near a 20-inch chestnut oak tree at a fence angle, and said point being N. 11* 02' E., approximately 410 feet from a chestnut stump at the most southeasterly corner of Tract No. 37; thence in a general westerly direction approximately 2,650 feet to a point where the center line crosses the southwest boundary of Tract No. 38; together with the right to clear said strip and keep it cleared, and the right to install and maintain anchors and to cut and remove danger trees outside said strip.
The positions of corners and directions of lines are referred to the Tennessee Coordinate System. The contour elevation is based on MSL Datum as established by the USC & 08 Southeastern Supplementary Adjustment of 1936.
