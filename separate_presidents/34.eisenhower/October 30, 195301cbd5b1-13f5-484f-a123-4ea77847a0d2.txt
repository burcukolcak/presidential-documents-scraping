Letter to Representative Clement J. Zablocki on the Arrest of Cardinal Wyszynski of Poland.
[Released October 30, 1953. Dated October 29, 1953]
Dear Mr. Zablocki:
I have your letter of October fourteenth regarding the action taken recently against a courageous leader of his Church, Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski, Primate of Poland. The arrest and internment of Cardinal Wyszynski is profoundly discouraging to those of us who look for signs of Communist willingness to respect basic human rights of freedom of thought and conscience. Without evidence of such willingness, it is difficult to believe that the Communist Governments intend to honor agreements which might be reached to reduce world tensions. You may recall that I spoke of this in connection with the arrest of Cardinal Wyszynski at my news conference of September thirtieth.
The calculated repression of all religious organization in the Communist States makes it apparent that wherever Communists are in position to use force and violence, they will do so in an effort to win domination not only over the body and mind of man, but over his soul as well. I share very strongly the conviction which was expressed in the condemnation of the action against Cardinal Wyszynski issued by the Department of State on September thirtieth, that the religious spirit of man will never be subdued or extinguished, and that it will remain a sustaining force Poland during the present tragic suffering of the Polish people. It is my intention that this Government continue to take all appropriate steps to see to it that Communist violations of the inalienable rights of man under God do not go unopposed, and that they are effectively exposed in every forum.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
