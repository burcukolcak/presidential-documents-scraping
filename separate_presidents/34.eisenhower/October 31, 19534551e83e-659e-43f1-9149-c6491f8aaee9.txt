Dwight D. Eisenhower
October 31, 1953

Statement by the President Recorded for the Program of the Committee on Religion in American Life.
EACH YEAR the Committee on Religion in American Life reminds us of the importance of faithful church attendance. It urges full support of religious institutions to the end that we may add strength and meaning to the religious virtues--charity, mercy, brother love, and faith in Almighty God. These spiritual concepts are the inspiration of the American way. It was once said, "America is great because America is good--and if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great."
By strengthening religious institutions, the Committee on Religion in American Life is helping to keep America good. Thus it helps each of us to keep America great.
I earnestly hope that during November, and throughout this and every year, each American citizen will actively support the religious institution of his own choice.
