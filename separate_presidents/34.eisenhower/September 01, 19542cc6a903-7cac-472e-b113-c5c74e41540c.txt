Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Providing Benefits for Government Employees.
I AM VERY HAPPY to approve H.R. 2263 which provides important benefits for employees of the Federal Government.
In the enactment of legislation benefiting government employees and improving government personnel management, the record of this Congress far surpasses that of any previous Congress. These various laws have largely accomplished the Administration's objectives in the field of personnel management during the 83d Congress. These objectives include:
--more efficient and flexible personnel administration in the Federal service;
--attractive employment conditions in government, more nearly in harmony with practices of progressive private employers;
--a better basis for relationships between the government as an employer and its employees.
Administrative steps to carry out this law include greater encouragement for suggestions, inventions and superior performance of employees, authorizations for longevity pay, and more equitable overtime pay practices. There will be many other administrative improvements under this new law.
Also a result of this legislation is an Executive Order, which I am now issuing, permitting the Civil Service Commission and agency heads to lift temporary limitations on promotions and reassignments of hundreds of thousands of career employees.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 2263 is Public Law 763, 83d Congress (68 Stat. 1105).
