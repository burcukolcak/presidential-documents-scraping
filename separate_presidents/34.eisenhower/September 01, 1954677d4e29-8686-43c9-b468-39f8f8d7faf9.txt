Statement by the President on the Death of Senator Maybank of South Carolina.
I DEEPLY REGRET the untimely passing of Senator Burner R. Maybank, whom I came to know well through his years of effective service on the old Senate Committee on Military Affairs. He was a dedicated servant of his state and the nation. His passing is a loss much to be regretted by all Americans who want men of integrity and ability in their government.
