Dwight D. Eisenhower
September 01, 1958

Statement by the President: Labor Day.
AMERICA AT WORK is a mighty force. In the factories that make up our most varied and powerful industrial complex, on our record-producing farms, in our modern hospitals and schools, in offices, in mines and on ranches, in laboratories and on fishing boats, in stores and shops and showrooms, the richness of our country and the capability of our people is everywhere seen.
Nowhere else has a nation of people so succeeded in using the resources of their land and the genius of their minds to provide such a high level of living for so large a population.
The working men and women of America have successfully met every challenge set before them. Now they are faced with the task of maintaining both the intricate equipment of national defense, which is the strong right arm of peace, and manning the constantly improving systems of national production, to which our standard of living is secured. It is my firm belief that they will meet these tasks with ability and stamina and pride.
for the ultimate strength of the American worker is in his own sense of personal worth and accomplishment, in his own dignity as a free man working in company with other free men. Of all the things we honor today, these are the most precious and most deserving of our gratitude.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
