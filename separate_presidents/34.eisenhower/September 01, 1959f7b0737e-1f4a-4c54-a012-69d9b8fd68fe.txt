Statement by the President Upon Signing the Supplemental Appropriations Act.
I HAVE today approved H.R. 7978, "An Act making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1960, and for other purposes."
There has been considerable controversy about provisions for sewage disposal at the Dulles International Airport. I had recommended a tie-in with the District of Columbia sewer system. The Congress, however, by eliminating certain funds in the Federal Aviation Agency appropriation request, has implied that it desires the Agency to build a sewage treatment plant at the airport with the treated effluent being emptied into a tributary of the Potomac River. This procedure is objected to by the Federal Aviation Agency, the Corps of Engineers, the District of Columbia Commissioners, and local planning and pollution abatement agencies.
I am asking the Federal Aviation Administrator not to proceed with work on the treatment plant until this issue has once more been fully examined. I have asked the Administrator to report to me in this regard as soon as possible.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 7978 is Public Law 86-213 (73 Stat. 437).
