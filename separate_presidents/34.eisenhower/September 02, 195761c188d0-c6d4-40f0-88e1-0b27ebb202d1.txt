Statement by the President: Labor Day.
IN A CLIMATE of general well-being, we celebrate Labor Day this year with deep appreciation. We live in a favored land where the fruits of production are widely shared. More Americans are holding jobs and enjoying security than ever before. It is fitting that we pause to pay tribute to the skill and strength of our working men and women. In their hands and minds is the power of our growth and the promise of continuing achievement.
We are thankful for the many blessings we have received in the past, and as free workers in a free society, we shall continue to labor for the progress and for the improvement of all.
