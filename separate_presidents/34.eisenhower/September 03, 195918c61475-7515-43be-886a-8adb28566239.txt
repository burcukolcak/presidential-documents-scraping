Joint Statement Following Discussions in Paris With Prime Minister Segni of Italy.
PRESIDENT EISENHOWER and Prime Minister Segni met today in the private residence of the United States Ambassador in Paris. Secretary of State Herter and Foreign Minister Pella were also present at the meeting, which lasted nearly two hours.
The international situation was carefully examined in the light of the conversations which President Eisenhower has had recently in Europe and in view of the exchange of visits which will take place in the near future with the Soviet Prime Minister.
The principal East-West problems were taken into consideration. Full identity of views resulted as to all questions examined.
Particular attention was devoted to the problem of disarmament and it was agreed that a controlled and balanced limitation of armaments represents the most appropriate means to guarantee peaceful relations between East and West.
The President and the Prime Minister stated once more that the West intends to pursue every effort to consolidate peace with justice.
They have also emphasized their firm determination to safeguard, through a common policy implemented in the framework of the Atlantic alliance and through further development of European collaboration, the freedom and security of the West.
In view of Italian interest in East-West problems and of the contribution which Italy can give to their solution, President Eisenhower and Prime Minister Segni will resume their consultations in Washington, immediately after the visit of the Soviet Prime Minister to the United States, on the occasion of the official visit of Prime Minister Segni.
