The two Chiefs of State expressed their complete agreement on the question of Berlin. They also agreed that a Summit Conference, useful in principle, should take place only when there is some possibility of definite accomplishment.
African problems in general and those which relate to North Africa in particular were discussed at some length. The President of the United States and the President of the French Republic stressed their devotion to the Atlantic alliance. They exchanged views with respect to means of assuring a more efficient functioning of this alliance.
The two Presidents reaffirmed the importance they attach to the resumption of negotiations on general and controlled disarmament as well as to the problem of assistance to the underdeveloped areas. They also examined the means of organizing better cooperation between the two countries in the world as a whole, especially through the expansion of consultations on all major problems, political as well as military.
