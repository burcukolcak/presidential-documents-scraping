Telegram to Adlai E. Stevenson Offering Him Access to Special Intelligence Information.
The Honorable Adlai E. Stevenson Libertyville, Illinois
Because you are the designated candidate of one of the major parties for the Presidency of the United States, I believe it to conform to the country's interests, and I would hope to your desire, for you to have periodic briefings on the international scene from a responsible official in the Central Intelligence Agency. To meet your requirements in this matter, on the assumption that you should like such information, I have already directed the Acting Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, General Cabell, to arrange details with you or with some designated member of your staff. I would suggest weekly briefings whenever this seems practicable to you.
Of course I need not say that the information itself would be of a secret character and exclusively for your personal knowledge. Otherwise, however, the receipt of such information would impose no obligation of any kind upon you.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
