Statement by the President on the Occasion of Rosh Hashana.
AT THIS SEASON when men and women of the Jewish Faith sit in judgment on themselves, reviewing their personal practice of moral and religious precepts during the year just ended, I join with my fellow Americans of all faiths in cordial greetings to them.
Rosh Hashana is significant to every American for, in the deepest spiritual sense, we are all of the seed of Abraham and Isaac. Our moral code, the ideals that animate us, the faith in God that strengthens us--all these were most clearly and most inspiringly proclaimed many centuries ago by men of Jewish blood.
Their descendants, in race and in faith, have contributed greatly to the knowledge and the skills and the culture of America. In war, they have freely given their lives for the preservation of the Republic. In peace, they have contributed greatly to the advancement of the general welfare.
At this Rosh Hashana, I know that all Americans join with me in best wishes to their fellow citizens--their friends and neighbors--of the Jewish Faith.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
