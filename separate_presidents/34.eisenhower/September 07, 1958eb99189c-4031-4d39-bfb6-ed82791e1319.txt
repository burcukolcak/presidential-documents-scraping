Statement by the President on the Fourth Anniversary of SEATO.
SEPTEMBER 8TH marks the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Manila Pact. four years ago, the United States joined with Australia, France, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, and the United Kingdom to form the South East Asia Treaty Organization.
The experience of the United States in the South East Asia Treaty Organization reaffirms our belief that an international organization of free peoples, conceived in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, provides a firm basis for common action to maintain peace and security.
Since 1954, the United States has participated in the continuing growth of cooperation among the member nations which has provided the conditions of stability indispensable to political, economic and social progress in South East Asia.
I am convinced that our cooperative efforts will continue to be successful. In the face of an undiminished challenge, the South East Asia Treaty Organization will vigorously maintain the protective shield necessary to the preservation of our common heritage of freedom.
