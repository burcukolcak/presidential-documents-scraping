Statement by the President on the Death of Chief Justice Vinson.
I SHARE the nation's shock and grief over Chief Justice Vinson's untimely death. He was my close personal friend for many years and a statesman and jurist whom I admired deeply.
A man of exemplary character, he possessed great human understanding, appreciation of our national heritage and a keen mind. He has filled positions of great responsibility in all three branches of Government--legislative, administrative and judicial. In all of them he served with efficiency, dignity and integrity. He was an outstanding citizen whose death is a loss to America.
Note: In addition to the foregoing statement, the President issued Proclamation 3031 (3 CFR, 1949-1953 Comp., p. 205) which provided that, as a mark of respect to the memory of Chief Justice Vinson, the flag of the United States should be flown at half-staff for 30 days on all Government buildings in the United States and in foreign countries, and that appropriate civil, military, and naval honors be rendered. The statement and the proclamation were released at Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Colo.
