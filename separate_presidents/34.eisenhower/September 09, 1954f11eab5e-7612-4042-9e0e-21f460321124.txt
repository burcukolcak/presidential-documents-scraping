Letter to Clarence Francis Requesting Him To Serve as Chairman of Interagency Committee on Agricultural Surplus Disposal.
Dear Mr. Francis:
The Executive Order which I have issued today establishing administrative arrangements for the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 provides, as you know, for an Interagency Committee on Agricultural Surplus Disposal with a representative of the White House Office as Chairman.
I request you to assume responsibility for organizing this Committee and to serve as its Chairman. I shall look to you for advice concerning policy issues that may develop.
In connection with the work of your Committee I shall expect you to be guided by the policy statement concerning foreign trade as related to agriculture which I have approved and issued today. I regard this document as an important announcement of the philosophy of this Administration with respect to agricultural foreign economic policy. It should generate confidence both at home and abroad as to our purposes in this vital area of international economic relations.
With best wishes,
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: Mr. Francis served as Special Consultant to the President. See notes to Items 261 and 263.
