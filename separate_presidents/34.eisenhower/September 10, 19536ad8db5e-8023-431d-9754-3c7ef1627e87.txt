Statement by the President on the Occasion of the Jewish New Year.
I AM happy to extend my warmest greetings to all Americans of Jewish faith on the occasion of the Jewish New Year.
Among the greatest lessons your history can teach, as the world struggles to find its way toward peace, are the patience and good will that have so frequently seen expression in the thousands of years of Jewish life. May this New Year bring to peoples of good faith everywhere the reassurance that more tranquil days are indeed near, and that the citizens of all nations will learn to live together with the understanding and harmony that God-loving people so fervently desire.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
