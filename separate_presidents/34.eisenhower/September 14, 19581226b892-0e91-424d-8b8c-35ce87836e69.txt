Statement by the President: The Jewish High Holy Days.
FROM THE EARLIEST TIME, from father to son, the Jews have been called to serve the Most High with all their heart and soul and might. Their fidelity to this call has formed their community, enriched our Nation and strongly influenced all lands where their faith is observed.
It is a privilege to extend annual greetings to those who are taking part in the Jewish High Holy Days and to wish each of them a Happy New Year.

The teaching of their ancient belief is filled with truth for the present day. Its profound sense of justice, nation to nation, man to man, is an essential part of every religious and social order. The health of our society depends upon a deep and abiding respect for the basic commandments of the God of Israel.
