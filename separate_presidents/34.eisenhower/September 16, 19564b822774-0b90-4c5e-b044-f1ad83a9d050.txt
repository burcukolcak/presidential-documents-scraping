Letter to President O'Kelly of Ireland on the Occasion of the Dedication of the Commodore Barry Statue at Wexford.
[ Released September 16, 1956. Dated September 14, 1956 ]
Dear Mr. President:
May I, through you, express to the people of Fire the sincere respect and good wishes of the people of the United States upon this significant occasion.
Nearly two centuries ago a young Irish lad went to sea from the land of his birth and sailed westward. In a few years he had become master of a merchant ship serving the American colonies. Then came a war of independence and he found his destiny in the naval forces of a new nation.
The name of John Barry and the honor he brought his adopted country live on in grateful memory. Just two days over a week ago, a new destroyer of the latest and most powerful class was placed in commission bearing his name. Two other vessels bearing the name of "Barry" preceded her in the United States Navy list.
Now John Barry symbolically has returned to his native land, brought there by a vessel of that Navy which he served so well. While his mortal remains lie in St. Mary's Churchyard, Philadelphia, this bronze statue, a gift of his grateful countrymen to the people of the land from which he sprung, will, we all hope, remain forever symbolic not only of the intermingling of our heritage but also of our common aspirations for liberty and justice for all of mankind.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
