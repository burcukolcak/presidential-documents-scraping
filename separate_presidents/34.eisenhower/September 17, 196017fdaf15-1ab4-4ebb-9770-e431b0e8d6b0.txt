Statement by the President Concerning the Attendance of Chiefs of State and Heads of Government at the U.N. General Assembly
THE UNITED STATES Government and State and local authorities are faced with an extremely difficult security problem in view of the forthcoming attendance at the United Nations General Assembly of nearly a score of Chiefs of State or Heads of Government, several of whom have been bitterly antagonistic to the United States.
In this situation, I am confident that I can count on the traditional dignity and cooperation of our people. Although the Chiefs of State or Heads of Government are coming to New York to attend the United Nations and not to visit the United States, it is essential that their activities in connection with the United Nations be in no way impaired. The United States Government, by its Agreement with the United Nations, has guaranteed free and unimpeded access to the United Nations so that the representatives of foreign governments may properly discharge their functions in connection with that organization.
The calm and reasonable conduct of our citizens will give a renewed demonstration of our nation's sense of responsibility.
Note: The statement was released at Camp David, Md.
