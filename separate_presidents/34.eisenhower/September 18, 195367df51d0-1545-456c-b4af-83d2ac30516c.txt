Statement by the President Concerning the New Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.
COMPLETION TODAY of the membership of the Commission on Intergovernmental Relations marks the commencement of an historic undertaking: the elimination of frictions, duplications and waste from Federal-State relations; the clear definition of lines of governmental authority in our nation; the increase in efficiency in a multitude of governmental programs vital to the welfare of all Americans.
The members of the new commission are distinguished, able, wisely informed in the area of study, and broadly representative in the problem area.
They have my deep appreciation and, I am sure, the appreciation of all Americans for their willing dedication of their valuable time and talent to this great national purpose.
Note: A list of the 25 members of the Commission, of which Clarence E. Manion served as Chairman, was released with the President's statement at Lowry Air Force Base in Denver, Colo. See also Items 16, 39, above.
