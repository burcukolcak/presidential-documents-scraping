Statement by the President: National Science Youth Month.
THIS present age requires a constant renewal of the Nation's supply of trained scientific personnel to meet the demands of industry, government, and research. Young Americans with aptitudes in science and technology must be given every opportunity to develop their abilities. At the same time, we can encourage all citizens to work toward a deeper understanding of these subjects.
America's future is dependent to a large degree upon the strengthening of every area of education. I hope the annual observance of National Science Youth Month will further stimulate our people's desire to learn and will help increase their respect for the quality of intellectual excellence.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
