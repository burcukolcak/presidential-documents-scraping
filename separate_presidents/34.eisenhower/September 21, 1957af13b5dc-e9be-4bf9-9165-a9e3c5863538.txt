WhereasChristopher Columbus, on his voyage of discovery, made known the existence of a new and wondrous land, with matchless opportunities for mankind; and
Whereasthroughout the ensuing centuries the continents of the world have moved closer together in time and space, by means of modern communication and transportation, thus becoming ever more interdependent and aware of their critical need for a just and lasting peace; and
Whereasthe imagination and daring of Christopher Columbus aroused the interest and enlisted the aid of many long ago, and continue to encourage all who believe in freedom and in the promise of distant horizons; and

I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on that day in honor of Christopher Columbus.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
