Statement by the President: The Jewish High Holy Days.
DURING the season of the Jewish High Holy Days it is always a pleasure to extend greetings to my fellow citizens of the Jewish faith.
I know this is a time of deep meaning for them. In the honored tradition of their ancient faith they are led to special acts of contrition, thanksgiving and praise. Sustained by the creative and moral power of their fathers' God they enter their new year with confidence.
This is my last opportunity to extend greetings on this occasion but as a private citizen I shall continue to remember these Holy Days each year with warmth and respect.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
