Dwight D. Eisenhower
September 22, 1958

Letter Accepting Resignation of Sherman Adams, The Assistant to the President.
Dear Sherman:
I deeply deplore the circumstances that have decided you to resign as The Assistant to the President.

Your selfless and tireless devotion to the work of the White House and to me personally has been universally recognized. In discharging the responsibilities of your vitally important post, with no hope of reward other than your own satisfaction in knowing that you have served your country well, your total dedication to the nation's welfare has been of the highest possible order.
Your performance has been brilliant; the public has been the beneficiary of your unselfish work. After our six years of intimate association you have, as you have had throughout, my complete trust, confidence and respect.
I accept your resignation with sadness. You will be sorry missed by your colleagues on the staff and by the departments and agencies of the government, with which you have worked so efficiently.

With warm regard and highest esteem,

As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
Note: The President's letter is dated at Newport, R.I. Governor Adams flew to the U. S. Naval Base there on September 22 and tendered his resignation in the course of a conference with the President. The text of Governor Adams' radio and television talk was released by the White House at the same time as the President's letter of acceptance.
