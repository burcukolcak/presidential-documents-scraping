Statement by the President Upon Approval of Bill for the Relief of the City of Madeira Beach, Florida
I HAVE today approved H.R. 2390, "For the relief of the city of Madeira Beach, Florida."
The bill authorizes the payment of $12,828.35 in full settlement of the claim of the city of Madeira Beach for the Government's proportionate share of a special assessment levied to pay the cost of erecting structures for controlling erosion of shore property, including 500 feet of beach property of the Veterans' Administration.
Approval of this bill in no way alters the conviction I expressed on August 15, 1953 when I withheld my approval from H.R. 2750, "For the relief of the city and county of Denver, Colorado." At that time I stated that the question of modifying the Federal Government's constitutional tax immunity should be dealt with broadly and deliberately, rather than by a succession of piece-meal decisions on individual requests.
I believe, however, that the claim of the city of Madeira Beach is exceptionally meritorious.
If the city had not provided erosion protection, the Veterans' Administration would eventually have constructed its own erosion control devices at a cost probably greater than the amount claimed by the city. Since the Government would otherwise have incurred costs at least as great, it is only equitable that the Government now pay the nondiscriminatory special assessment levied on it by the city of Madeira Beach.
It is my hope that current consideration of the problems involved in payments by the Federal Government to State and local governments in lieu of taxes will result in soundly conceived general legislation which will make future private bills unnecessary.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 2390 is Public Law 86-353 (73 Stat. 627).
