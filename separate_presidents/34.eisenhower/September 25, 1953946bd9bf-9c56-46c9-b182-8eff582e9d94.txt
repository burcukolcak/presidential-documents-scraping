Memorandum Directing Federal Agencies To Participate in a Civil Defense Exercise.
To the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies:
The need for effective civil defense planning is still vital to our national welfare. But national plans and preparations are of little value without active participation at local community levels. The Director of the Office of Civil Defense for the District of Columbia, through the Deputy Director of Federal Buildings Services, has again scheduled a Civil Defense Exercise to be held on November 5, 1953. I recognize that such tests are essential to the proper training of Federal employees in their local civil defense duties and I continue to urge all Departments and Agencies to prepare for these exercises to the fullest extent possible.
Accordingly, it is directed that each Department and Agency of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government in the Metropolitan Area of Washington participate in the Civil Defense Exercise which will be held on November 5, 1953.
