Statement by the President on the Death of President Somoza of Nicaragua.
THE NATION and I personally regret the death of President Somoza of Nicaragua as a result of the dastardly attack made upon him several days ago by an assassin.
President Somoza constantly emphasized, both publicly and privately, his friendship for the United States--a friendship that persisted until the moment of his death.
