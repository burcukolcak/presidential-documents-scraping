Dwight D. Eisenhower
September 30, 1956

Statement by the President Marking National Newspaper Week.
To the Newspapers of the Nation:
Our Nation is based upon an informed and concerned citizenry. When our people know the facts, the decisions they make are for the good of the country.
The ten thousand newspapers of America, consequently, have a great responsibility. As one of the oldest and most important means of communication, our newspapers must present the facts honestly and in the proper perspective, as their editors continue to speak fearlessly on issues they consider to be of local and national importance.
When Americans know the truth, they are strong and free to act for the best interest of the Nation and the world. This is the challenge of National Newspaper Week.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
