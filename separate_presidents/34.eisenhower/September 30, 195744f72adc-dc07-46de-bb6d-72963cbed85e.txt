Dwight D. Eisenhower
September 30, 1957

Statement by the President Marking National Newspaper Week.
To the Newspapers of the Nation:
During National Newspaper Week, we honor the journalists of our land who daily supply us with many of the facts and opinions which form the basis of our decisions.
The accuracy, speed and courage of America's free press are unsurpassed, and the tradition of responsible journalism is one of the keystones of our democratic society. But in this age of mass communication when falsehood and pretense can be so widely disseminated, it is more important than ever to honor those who seek the truth and make it forcefully known.
It is a privilege to salute the reporters, the editors and all who serve the national community through the medium of the press.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
