Dwight D. Eisenhower
September 30, 1958

Statement by the President: National Newspaper Week.
A STRONG SOCIETY of free men must be kept fully informed. Liberty can flourish only in the climate of truth.

In our American tradition much of the burden for making known the affairs of the day falls upon the newspapers of the Nation. With thorough and fearless inquiry, with clear and responsible reporting, the press renders a fundamental service to the citizens of our Republic.
Each year, during National Newspaper Week, I am glad to send greetings to the members of the press. Our Nation and all its people are more than ever, in these critical times, dependent upon those newspaper standards which separate the significant from the sensational, scorn half truths and rumor, and consider their profession for what it basically is: a public trust.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
