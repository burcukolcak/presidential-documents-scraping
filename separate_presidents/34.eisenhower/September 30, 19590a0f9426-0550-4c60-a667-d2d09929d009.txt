The President's Toast at the Luncheon at the White House Honoring Prime Minister Segni of Italy.
Mr. Prime Minister:
It is a very real pleasure for Mrs. Eisenhower and me to have you and Mrs. Segni in Washington as our honored guests. We have been looking forward to this occasion for some time and I am particularly glad we are able to renew our acquaintance so shortly after meeting in Paris earlier this month.
We are very pleased to have the opportunity which your visit affords us to exchange views with you and your colleagues on those important world issues which are before us today. These close consultations between allies which can be carried on in an atmosphere of candor and confidence are of great importance. Italy and the United States happily share the same beliefs and principles and, although our languages may be different, we understand each other when we talk of a world free from fear and secure in justice.
You, Mr. Prime Minister, are well known to us in this country as a statesman and a scholar. The important role you have played in your country, dedicated as you are to the welfare and serf-respect of mankind, is an inspiration to all of us. We are truly delighted that you have been able to accept our invitation to come to the United States and we welcome this opportunity to greet you.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the President of the Republic of Italy.
