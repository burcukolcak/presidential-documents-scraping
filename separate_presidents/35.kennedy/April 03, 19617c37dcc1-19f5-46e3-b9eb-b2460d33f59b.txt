Message to the Secretary General of NATO on the 12th Anniversary of the Signing of the North Atlantic Treaty.
APRIL 4th marks the 12th Anniversary of the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty.
We are justified in taking pride in our achievements in NATO and in those other cooperative endeavors in which we are engaged. But this day also reminds us of our obligations to the future. The years ahead will demand of us all courage, sacrifice and the will to seize every opportunity to secure and to advance human liberty. In cooperation with one another, and all those around the globe who believe in the freedom of man, we can and we will succeed.

Let us on this Anniversary look to the future in this spirit. If we do the cause of freedom will prevail.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[His Excellency Alberico Casardi, Acting Secretary General, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Paris]
