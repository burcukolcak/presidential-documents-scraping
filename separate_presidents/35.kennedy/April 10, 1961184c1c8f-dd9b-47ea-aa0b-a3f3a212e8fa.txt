Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House on the National Aeronautics and Space Council.
Wear Mr.___________:
I transmit herewith, for the consideration of the Congress, a draft bill relating to the National Aeronautics and Space Council.
I contemplate making the Council an active and useful instrumentality. To achieve that end it is necessary, in my view, to amend existing law providing for the Council.
As you know, it is now the duty of the President to preside over meetings of the Council. As has been previously announced, I desire to place the Council under the chairmanship of the Vice President. The primary effect of the attached amendatory bill, if enacted, will be to make that possible.
I believe that the Vice President can contribute importantly to, and give me valuable counsel and assistance with respect to, space programs, and that the chairmanship of the National Aeronautics Space Council will materially enhance his opportunity and capability to render maximum service.
I therefore recommend that the Congress enact legislation along the .lines of the attached draft bill.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
Note: This is the text of identical letters addressed to the Honorable Lyndon B. Johnson, President of the Senate, and to the Honorable Sam Rayburn; Speaker of the House of Representatives.
The draft bill was released with the President's letter.
