Dear Mr.___________:
The Government Employees Training Act (Public Law 85-507) directs the Civil Service Commission to submit annually to the President for his approval and transmittal to the Congress a report with respect to the training of employees of the Government under the authority of the Act. I am transmitting to you with this letter the Commission's report and review of progress in employee development activities entitled, "Employee Development and Training in the Federal Civil Service, fiscal Year 1961."
It is significant that the Federal departments and agencies specifically recognize that improved training is an essential element in 1) increasing employee skills and knowledge, 2) improving the services rendered the public, 3) introducing new and better work methods, 4) developing a reservoir of management talent, 5) expediting our missile and space programs, 6) developing and establishing new and improved medical techniques in our Federal medical centers, and 7) developing competent personnel to administer international assistance programs.
The Commission reports that training is being conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Government Employees Training Act.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
