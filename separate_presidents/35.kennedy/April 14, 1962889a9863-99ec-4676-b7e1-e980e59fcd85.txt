Remarks Aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise After Observing Naval Maneuvers
Admiral, Captain, gentlemen:
I want to express on behalf of the Members of the Congress, the Ambassadors from many countries, on behalf of myself, and I think the people of the United States, our great appreciation to you, both for your efforts today and your efforts on other days and nights, in spring and in winter and in summer.
The United States Navy helps secure the freedom of countries thousands of miles away. Ships which sail hundreds of miles from coasts to far-off places, preserve the freedom of those countries. And therefore as a former member of the United States Navy, and now as President, I want to express to you our heartfelt appreciation. I hope you realize the contribution that you are making not only to the preservation of the peace, but to the preservation of the freedom of this country and the over 50 countries which are allied with us, and others which, while not allied, benefit from our strength.
What you have shown us today--the ships, the techniques, and most of all your own skill and courage--makes all of us return to the Capital with a good deal more confidence and hope.
I am very grateful to you, and I want to express my personal thanks to all of you.
Note: The President spoke from the hangar deck of the aircraft carrier Enterprise at sea off the North Carolina coast, where he had observed a demonstration by the Atlantic fleet. His opening words "Admiral, Captain" referred to Adm. Robert L. Dennison, Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic. and Commander of the Atlantic fleet, and to Capt. Vincent P. de Poix, Commander of the Enterprise.
