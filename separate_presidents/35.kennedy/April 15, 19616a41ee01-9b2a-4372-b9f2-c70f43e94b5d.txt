[Released April 15, 1961. Dated April 13, 1961]
Dear Mr. President:
I take great pleasure in extending to you, both personally and officially, my very warm greetings and heartiest congratulations upon the occasion of your inauguration as the first President of the Republic of Togo.
The overwhelming majority by which you were elected reflects the Togolese people's admiration and appreciation for the enlightened leadership you have given during the achievement and consolidation of your country's independence.
May your years in office be marked by peace and prosperity for the Togolese people and by increasingly friendly relations between Togo and the United States.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
