Proclamation 3535â€”Mother's Day, 1963

Whereasthe strength of our Nation depends upon the strength of the American home, which is based on the virtues fostered by the mothers of our country; and
Whereasthe American mother plays a vital role by precept and example in building a strong family unit and in teaching our children to become good citizens; and
Whereasit is fitting that we should set aside one day of each year to acknowledge and express publicly our great affection, gratitude, and respect for the mothers of our Nation; and
Whereasby a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770) the Congress designated the second Sunday in May of each year as Mother's Day and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for the public observance of that day:
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, May 12, 1963, be observed as Mother's Day, and I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
I urge the people of the United States to give expression on that day to their love and gratitude for their mothers publicly by display of the flag at their homes or other suitable places and privately through prayer and thoughtful acts of affection and devotion.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-sixth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh.
