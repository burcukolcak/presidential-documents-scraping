Statement by the President on the Philippines War Damage Bill.
THE ACTION of the House of Representatives today in passing the Philippines War Damage Bill is a reaffirmation of the United States intention to honor a long-standing moral commitment to the Philippine people. It corrects the record of last May when, partly through a misunderstanding of the issues involved, an earlier version of this bill was defeated. I congratulate the House of Representatives for taking this action designed to clarify our relations with our Philippine friends and allies. I hope the Senate will soon act favorably on this important legislation.
Note: The act, "War Damage Compensation-Philippines," authorizing payment of the balance of awards for war damage compensation made by the Philippine War Damage Commission under the terms of the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of April 30, 1946, was approved by the President on August 30, 1962 (Public Law 87-616, 76 Stat. 411).
