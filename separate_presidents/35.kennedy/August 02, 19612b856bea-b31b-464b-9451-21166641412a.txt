Letter to Secretary Hodges Requesting Recommendations for Dealing With the Problems of the Transportation Industry.
Dear Mr. Secretary:
It is becoming increasingly clear that the current difficulties facing all segments of the transportation industry will require increased leadership and additional actions on the part of the Federal Government.
I would appreciate it if you would take the lead in developing for my consideration recommendations which could be made to the next session of Congress on this subject. These recommendations should include both long range and short range actions necessary to achieve and maintain healthy and efficient transportation systems.
Since the Department of Commerce has the statutory authority for the development of a national transportation policy, I am placing the primary responsibility for this task in the Department. Under your direction, I will expect full cooperation and participation of all other Federal agencies with functions and interests in the transportation area. Copies of this letter are being transmitted to these agencies.
It is my desire that you complete this task and have your recommendations in my hands by November 1, 1961

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
