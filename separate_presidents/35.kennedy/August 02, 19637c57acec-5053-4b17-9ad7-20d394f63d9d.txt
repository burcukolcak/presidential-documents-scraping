Remarks to the Delegates of Girls Nation.
Girls:
I want to express my thanks to all of you. I can imagine nothing happier than to be a citizen of Girls Nation, and I accept the invitation. Last week we had a group of boys from Boys Nation, and I said they showed more initiative than the Governors, which got me into a great deal of difficulty. So I will be very careful today and say that you are more beautiful than the Governors, and to tell you that we are delighted to have you, and say that I am really delighted that you are taking such an interest in our Government.
I keep reading that Republicans are elected by the boys and girls, but as you get older, you will find that there are two parties, and that there is some good in both of them.
We are glad to have you here. I hope you are going to go through the White House, if you have not already been. This house belongs to all of you. It is very much connected with the best of our history. Just behind you are two trees that were planted by Andrew Jackson when he was President, and that tallest tree over there was planted by John Adams, who was the first President of the United States to live here in the White House.
This is a great country and requires a good deal of all of us, so I can imagine nothing more important than for all of you to continue to work in public affairs and be interested in them, not only to bring up a family, but also give part of your time to your community, your State, and your country.
So we are very pleased to have you here. I can think of no guests who are more appropriately welcome, and I am confident that some day it is very possible--well, it may not be possible for you to be President, but at least I am sure we are talking to a future First Lady.
Note: The President spoke at 9:45 a.m. in the Flower Garden at the White House.
