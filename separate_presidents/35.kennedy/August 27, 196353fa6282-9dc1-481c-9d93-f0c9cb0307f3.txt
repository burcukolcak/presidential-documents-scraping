Proclamation 3550â€”General Pulaski's Memorial Day, 1963

Whereas, as we work toward political, social, and economic freedom for all nations everywhere, we remember the time when we ourselves were not free; and
Whereaswe recall with gratitude the gallant efforts of men of other nations who helped us to win our own independence; and
Whereasa leader among those men was Casimir Pulaski, who opposed foreign interference in his native Poland, who joined the cause of American independence by volunteering in the Continental Army, and who served that cause brilliantly until his death on October 11, 1779, from a wound incurred during a cavalry charge in the city of Savannah; and
Whereas, in remembering General Pulaski's contribution to our past, we are reminded of our debt to the future to further the cause of universal freedom;
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Friday, October 11, 1963-the one hundred and eighty-fourth anniversary of his death-as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; and call upon officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day. I also invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in recognition of General Pulaski's dedication to liberty.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 27th day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth.
