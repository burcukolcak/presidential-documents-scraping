Remarks Upon Presenting the Enrico Fermi Award to Dr. Hans Bethe
DOCTOR, I want to express my appreciation and pleasure, taking part in this ceremony in which you receive this justly earned award.
This country and I believe the whole free world--in fact, the entire world--has benefited from the number of extraordinarily gifted scientists who came to our country from Western Europe, who played a most important and vital role in the defense of our country in times of danger, and who have also helped make possible for our people the benefits of science--in making their lives easier and happier and more secure.
So that I take pleasure in presenting this award to you, for your own extraordinary work and also in calling to the minds of our fellow citizens the great debt we owe to so many people who came to this country and made the United States their home.
I congratulate you for the versatility of your work, as well as its significance. I express appreciation to the members of the advisory panel who participated in this selection--and to all those who work in the frontiers of knowledge.
Note: The ceremonies were held in the Cabinet Room at the White House.
Dr. Bethe, Professor of Physics at Cornell University, came to the United States from Germany in 1935. The award cited his "contributions to nuclear and theoretical physics, to peaceful uses of atomic energy, and to the security of the United States."
