Statement by the President Upon Establishing Awards for Significant Contributions to the Export Expansion Program.
I AM DELIGHTED to be able to announce the revival of a great national symbol in a new and constructive context of national urgency.
The "E" flag that once flew over plants making notable records in war production now will fly over factories contributing significantly to the goals of international peace and prosperity. I call on both management and labor to exert their utmost efforts toward producing and selling in the world market. Here is the next great frontier we must cross. The United States must in the best traditions of American competitiveness and ingenuity, push forward with the development and sale of goods in all the markets of the world.
An increased level of exports is absolutely essential for a healthy situation in our international balance of payments. Such a healthy situation in turn will enable us to carry our international responsibilities for preservation of freedom.
I hope that all Americans will regard the new "E" symbol as an incentive to their best efforts.
More exports will mean a stronger America; a more prosperous America, and greater assurance of a free world.
Note: Executive Order 10978 "Establishing Presidential Awards for Significant Contributions to the Export Expansion Program" was issued by the President on December 5, 1961 (26 F.R. 11714).
