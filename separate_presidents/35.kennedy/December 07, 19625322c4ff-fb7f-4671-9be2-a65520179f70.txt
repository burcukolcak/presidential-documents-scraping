Remarks Upon Arrival at the Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque.
Senator Anderson, Mr. Vice President, Congressman Morris, Congressman Montoya, ladies and gentlemen:
I want to express my thanks in behalf of the Vice President and myself to all of you for coming out and giving us a warm welcome.
We have been today to SAC, where we saw a good many Americans who have served this country well, and then to Los Alamos, where we have dedicated scientists who are also contributing to our security. Now we come to Albuquerque.
I have some particular reason, the Vice President and I, to be particularly sentimental about this community. We did not win by such a landslide in 1960 that we do not remember that the only places west of the Mississippi that we carried were Nevada and New Mexico, outside of Texas. So we want to express--this is a nonpolitical trip but these things don't get so far away from us.
I want to thank you very much for coming out here tonight. We are very much indebted to Senator Anderson and your Congressional delegation for having invited us.

Thank you.
Note: The President's opening words referred to Clinton P. Anderson, U.S. Senator from New Mexico; Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson; and Thomas G. Morris and Joseph M. Montoya, U.S. Representatives from New Mexico.
