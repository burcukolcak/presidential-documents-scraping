Remarks at the Ground-Breaking Ceremonies for the U.S. Pavilion, New York World's Fair.
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Winston, Mr. Moses, Mr. Serevane, gentlemen:
I want to express my great appreciation to all those of you who've been connected with this fair: to Mr. Moses, who's been working so hard to make it a reality; Mr. Winston, who has been working on the American exhibit; the Mayor, who's given it his close sponsorship since it began; and all of you, particularly those of you who are building it.
This is going to be a chance for us in 1964 to show 75 million people, not only our countrymen here in the United States but people from all over the world, what kind of a people we are and what kind of a country we have, what the land is like and what we've done with the land, what our people are like and what we've done with our people, and what's gone in the past and what's coming in the future. That is what a World's Fair should be about and the theme of this World's Fair "Peace Through Understanding" is most appropriate in these years of the sixties. I want the people of the world to visit this fair and all the various exhibits of our American industrial companies and the foreign companies, who are most welcome, and to come to the American exhibit, the exhibit of the United States, and see what we have accomplished through a system of freedom. So we begin today with this ceremony. We'll begin again in April of 1964, and we'll show what we've done in the past, and even more important, what America is going to be in the future.

Thank you.
Note: The President spoke at 1:20 p.m. at Flushing Meadow Park, Long Island, N.Y. His opening words referred to Robert F. Wagner, Mayor of New York City; Norman K. Winston, Commissioner, U.S. Commission of the New York World's Fair; and Robert Moses and Paul R.
