Statement by the President on the Birthday of Woodrow Wilson.
TODAY marks the birth of Woodrow Wilson, shaper of the first working plan for international cooperation among all peoples of the world. "What we seek," he said, "is the reign of law, based on the consent of the governed and sustained by the organized opinion of mankind." Every subsequent effort to create a stable world order has gone back for inspiration to his efforts and has owed much to his vision.
The papers of Woodrow Wilson are now being collected and edited under the auspices of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation. This definitive edition will stand beside the papers of the great men of the formative period of our history--those of Adams and Franklin, Jefferson and Hamilton: a reminder that the twentieth century has not been lacking in the highest quality of leadership. This vitally important project has my heartiest endorsement and should have the support of every American who is devoted to what is best and most enduring in the American heritage.
