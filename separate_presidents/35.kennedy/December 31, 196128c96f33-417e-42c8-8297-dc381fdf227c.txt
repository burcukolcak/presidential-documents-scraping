Message to Members of the Armed Forces Serving Overseas.
[Broadcast over Armed Forces radio networks]
I EXTEND to each of you my thanks for your past year of service to our Nation and my best wishes for your continued efforts during 1962.
Spending long periods away from home in foreign lands entails--in many cases-personal sacrifice. But over the years, the defense of freedom has never been easy--and in today's world it is not apt to be easier.
Our foreign policy is based on goals of freedom and justice. It is in the interest of these goals that we ask you to serve your country overseas. Your Nation depends on you and your colleagues, not just for the execution of American foreign policy, but for the embodiment of the spirit and ideals of our country.
Let this then be the New Year's resolution of Americans serving our country overseas: To show dedication to our highest national ideals by living and working in ways which will best illustrate these ideals to others.
