Recorded Message to the People of Viet-Nam on the Occasion of Their New Year's Celebration.
ON THE OCCASION of your New Year's celebration, my fellow Americans and I extend our very best wishes for the prosperity and well-being of the government and the people of Viet-Nam.
In your struggle against the aggressive forces of communism, the sacrifices that you have willingly made, the courage you have shown, the burdens you have endured have been a source of inspiration to people all over the world.
Let me assure you of our continued assistance in the development of your capabilities to maintain your freedom and to defeat those who wish to destroy that freedom.
We in America sincerely hope that the year of the Tiger will see peace come again to Viet-Nam. We know that courage and dedication to peace and freedom will prevail-and that prospects for Viet-Nam will brighten during the coming year.
And we look forward confidently with you to the day when your country will again be at peace--united, prosperous, and free.
