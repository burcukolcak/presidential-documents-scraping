Remarks at the Swearing In of Robert C. Weaver as Housing and Home Finance Administrator.
IT IS a great pleasure to welcome Mr. and Mrs. Weaver to the White House, and also it is a great pleasure for me to participate in Mr. Weaver's swearing-in.
The responsibility which he is assuming is one of the most important in the country. Under Mr. Weaver's leadership, it is our hope that housing, shelter, for all Americans can be substantially improved.
Public housing, urban renewal, private housing, all of this represents a basic aspiration of American families to house themselves securely. There are, according to our latest Census Bureau figures, over 25 million Americans who live in substandard housing. It is the ambition of this administration to try to provide decent housing for all American families, and Mr. Weaver's responsibility will be to lead this important national effort.
So I am delighted to have them here. I have the highest confidence in his ability, his energy, his integrity, his loyalty; and I am confident that he will serve as a force in this important field for a better life for all Americans.
So we are glad to see you, Mr. Weaver, and to present you with this certificate.
