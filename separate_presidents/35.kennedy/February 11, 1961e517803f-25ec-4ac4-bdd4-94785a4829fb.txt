Statement by the President Upon Announcing the Appointment of Aubrey J. Wagner as a Member of the Board of Directors, Tennessee Valley Authority.
I REGARD Mr. Wagner's appointment as a recognition not only of his own career and capacities but of the loyalty and dedication that has uniquely characterized the staff of the Tennessee Valley Authority over the full period of its development. The ranks of the agency can boast other men and women who like Mr. Wagner have torn loose from their own geographical roots to devote careers to this region that had become an eddy in the mainstream of progress.
The TVA has done a remarkable job but the job is not done. It has demonstrated in 27 years that it has the imagination and flexibility to grow with its times but it must prove in its second quarter century that it can remain vigorous as it grows old. The TVA, like every vital branch of the government, must never allow itself to relapse into an attitude of entrenched bureaucracy.
I want to be sure also that we lose no opportunity to share the great experience of the TVA with other nations faced with the gap between resources and resource development. I want the agency to study ways in which the lessons it has learned in the Tennessee Valley may be exported abroad and applied to our great objective of human enhancement.
Toward these ends I would like a report from the TVA Board by April 15 so that I may know the directions in which the agency proposes to work in the years immediately ahead.
Note: A report entitled "TVA Directions--Past and Future" (:20 pp., mimeographed) was submitted to the President on April 26, 1961.
