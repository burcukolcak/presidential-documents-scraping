Statement by the President on Secretary Rusk's Decision To Attend the SEATO Council of Ministers Meeting in Bangkok
I am highly pleased that the Secretary of State, despite his crowded calendar, has decided to attend the SEATO Council of Ministers Meeting at Bangkok on March 27.
The Council Meeting will afford the Secretary his first opportunity to meet personally with the Foreign Ministers of the member states of this important organization. This meeting will also provide the Secretary with a far-reaching opportunity to participate in and contribute to SEATO's vital work of promoting peace, stability and regional solidarity in the face of the threat now posed to Southeast Asia by the continuing communist pressures. One of the subjects the Secretary expects to discuss with his colleagues in SEATO will be the most effective way to conduct the future business of that Organization.
Details of Mr. Rusk's itinerary as well as the composition of the Delegation will be announced later by the Department of State. I understand that the Secretary's time is severely limited and that his route to Bangkok will necessarily be as direct as possible.
NOTE: The list of members of the U.S. delegation accompanying Secretary Rusk to the SEATO Council at Bangkok is published in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 44, P. 550).
