Telegram to the Governors of the States Urging Action To Bolster the Economy by Speeding Up Public Works.
[Released February 16, 1961. Dated February 15, 1961]
Dear Governor__________:
I urge prompt consideration of specific action at every level of government in this country to invigorate our economy, including acceleration of State and local projects that are genuinely useful and will provide immediate jobs and business help. I also personally want to emphasize the fact that the Federal Government has released for obligation this month $724 million for the Federal Aid Highway Program and $350 million in appropriations for direct Federal construction and construction grants primarily for hospitals, schools in federally affected areas, and waste treatment facilities. Use of these funds is now largely dependent on State and local action. I will appreciate your cooperation to speed these and other needed public programs to strengthen the economy in your area and throughout the Nation.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
