(a) the law of such State provides for the payment of employee contributions to such State or State-sponsored employee retirement disability, or death benefits systems by withholding sums from the compensation of such State employees and making returns of such sums to officials of such State or organizations designated by such officials to receive sums withheld for such programs.
(b) civilian employees of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard: other than those employed by the National Guard Bureau, are eligible for membership in a State retirement, disability, or death benefits system; and

SEC. 3. Each such agreement shall:
(a) Provide that the Secretary of the Army with respect to civilian employees of the Army National Guard, and the Secretary of the Air Force with respect to civilian employees of the Air National Guard, shall comply with the requirements of such State law in the case of employees subject to the said act of June 15, 1956, as amended, who are eligible for membership in such retirement, disability, or death benefits system for State employees;

SEC. 5. Nothing in this order, or in rules or regulations issued thereunder, or in any agreement entered into pursuant thereto, shall be construed as giving consent to the application of any provision of law of any State which has the effect of imposing more burdensome requirements upon the United States than it imposes upon departments, agencies, or political subdivisions of the State concerned, with respect to employees thereof who are members of the State or State sponsored retirement, disability, or death benefits system, or which has the effect of subjecting the United States or any of its officers or employees to any penalty or liability.
SEC. 6. I hereby delegate to the Secretary of Defense authority to prescribe such rules and regulations, not inconsistent herewith, as may be necessary to effectuate further the provisions of the said act of June 15, 1956, as amended, or of this order.
