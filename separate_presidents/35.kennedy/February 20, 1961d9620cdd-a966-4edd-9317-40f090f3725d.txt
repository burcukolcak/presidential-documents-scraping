Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House Transmitting Bill To Amend the Social Security Act.
My dear Mr.__________:
I am transmitting herewith a bill to make five needed improvements in the social security program.
They will not only help to meet pressing social needs, but if promptly enacted these improvements will give our economic recovery program needed impetus. They will result in placing increased purchasing power in the hands of almost five million people. These people are among the lowest income groups in the country.
In addition, the legislation will improve the flexibility and effectiveness of our social security program over the long run and make it better able to contribute to the economic strength of the Nation and the welfare and security of our people.
The enclosed letter from the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare describes the legislation in more detail.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
Note: This is the text of identical letters addressed to the Honorable Lyndon B. Johnson, President of the Senate, and to the Honorable Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Secretary Ribicoff's letter, also released, recommended the following improvements in the social security program:
1. Increases in the minimum benefits.
2. Retirement benefits for men at age 62.
3. Liberalization of the insured status requirements.
4. Increases in benefits for widows, widowers, or parents.
5. Providing benefits after 6-months total disability even though it is expected the worker will eventually recover.
