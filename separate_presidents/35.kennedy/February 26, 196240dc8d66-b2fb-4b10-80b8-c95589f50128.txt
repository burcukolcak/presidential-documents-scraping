Proclamation 3451—National Farm Safety Week, 1962

Whereasaccidents result in disabling injuries and often death to a million farm residents each year; and
Whereasthose farm accidents are responsible for needless suffering and incapacity, and cause wasteful economic losses to both the farm community and the Nation; and
Whereasall Americans are concerned about the safety and well-being of farm families from whom we receive our abundance of food and other essential agricultural commodities; and
Whereasnearly one hundred thousand voluntary lenders, two million farm families and one million 4-H Club boys and girls actively participated in the farm, home, and highway safety training program last year; and
Whereasthe annual records show a notable and steady decline in the number and rate of accidents among farm people as a direct result of this national program of self-training under sound guidance; and
Whereasthat decline in farm accidents demonstrates the value of community and national farm safety activities:
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,President of the United States of America, do hereby call on the people of the Nation to observe the week beginning July 22, 1962, as National Farm Safety Week, and I urge all citizens in our great farm community to actively heed the theme "Family Safety—At Work and Play."
I also urge all persons and organizations allied with agriculture to join in a strong, concerted effort to reduce the number of farm, home, and highway accidents.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 26th day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one

hundred and eighty-sixth.
