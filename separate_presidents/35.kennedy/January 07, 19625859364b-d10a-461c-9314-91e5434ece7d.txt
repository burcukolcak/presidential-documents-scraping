Statement by the President Following a Meeting With General Clay on the Berlin Situation.
GENERAL CLAY and I have had a most useful and satisfactory review of the current situation in Berlin and Germany. I have been very glad to get his report of the continued staunchness of the free people of West Berlin, and we have talked at length about the ways and means of sustaining and strengthening the life of their great city in the future as in the past.
We have also reviewed the general problem of effective handling of possible crisis situations, and we have reached full agreement on the policy to be followed during these months.
This meeting is one more way in which Mr. Rusk, General Clay, and I can keep in the closest touch, and we continue to be fortunate in having him as the senior American in Berlin.
Note: Gen. Lucius D. Clay was serving as the President's personal representative in Berlin, with the rank of Ambassador.
