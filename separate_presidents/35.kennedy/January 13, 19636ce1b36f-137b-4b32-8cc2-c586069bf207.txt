Letter to John J. McCloy Concerning His Part in Negotiations on Cuba.
[Released January 13, 1963. Dated January 7, 1963]
Dear John:
I want to express to you my very great appreciation for your latest act of service to the Nation.
Your work with Ambassador Stevenson and the State and Defense Departments in the difficult negotiations on the Cuban affair has been most valuable. I am grateful for both the knowledge and skill which you brought to this complex assignment and the devotion to public service which led you to accept without hesitation the considerable personal inconvenience which I know these talks entailed for you.
Please accept my thanks. I am confident that I could call on you again if the need arises in connection with this or other matters of grave national concern.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[Honorable John J. McCloy, Ford Foundation, 477 Madison Avenue, New York City, New York]
Note: As Special Adviser on Cuban Affairs, Mr. McCloy led a U.S. team at the United Nations in the negotiations over the Soviet missile bases in Cuba.
