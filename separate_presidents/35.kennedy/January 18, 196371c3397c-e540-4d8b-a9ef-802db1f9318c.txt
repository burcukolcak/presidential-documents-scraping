John F. Kennedy
January 18, 1963

Statement by the President on the Death of Hugh Gaitskell.
I AM deeply grieved by the death of Hugh Gaitskell. His strength of character, force of intelligence, and generosity of purpose made him one of the foremost figures in the Western community. In his passing, freedom loses a gallant champion. Mrs. Kennedy and I send our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Gaitskell and to Mr. Gaitskell's friends and associates in Britain and throughout the world.
