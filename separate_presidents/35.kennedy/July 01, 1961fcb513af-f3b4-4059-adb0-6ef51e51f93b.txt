Statement by the President Concerning Economic Cooperation Between the United States and Pakistan.
THE COMPLETION of ten years of economic cooperation between Pakistan and the United States stands as firm evidence of the friendly relations existing between our two countries. In observing this significant milestone, we are proud to have the privilege of working with the people of Pakistan, and it is our firm intention to continue in a joint effort to secure peace and progress for the community of free nations.
We have made known our deep interest in the success of the Second Five-Year Plan, and we intend to support the determined effort of the Pakistan Government and people to insure its success.
I wish particularly to offer congratulations to President Ayub and the Government and people of Pakistan for the vigor which characterizes their efforts to build a still stronger nation. The achievement of greater human well-being motivates free men everywhere. We in the United States admire Pakistan for her steady adherence to the goal of human betterment. We join her in facing the future with inspiration and confidence.
