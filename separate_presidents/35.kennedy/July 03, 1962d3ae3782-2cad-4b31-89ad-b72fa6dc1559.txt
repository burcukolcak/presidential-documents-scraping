Statement by the President on the Occasion of Algerian Independence.
THIS moment of national independence for the Algerian people is both a solemn occasion and one of great joy. The entire world shares in this important step toward fuller realization of the dignity of man.
I am proud that it falls to me as the President of the people of the United States to voice on their behalf the profound satisfaction we feel that the cause of freedom of choice among peoples has again triumphed.
We Americans who at this time are celebrating the anniversary of our own independence--a freedom achieved only after great difficulties and much bloodshed--feel with you the surge of pride and satisfaction that is yours today on this momentous occasion.
We congratulate your leaders and their French colleagues on the wise statesmanship, patience and depth of vision they showed in paving the way for this historic event.
As one who has been interested in the future of the Algerian people for many years, it is with special pride that I extend the good wishes of the American people to the people of Algeria. In the coming days, we wish to strengthen and multiply the American bonds of friendship with the Government and people of Algeria. We look forward to working together with you in the cause of freedom, peace and human welfare.
