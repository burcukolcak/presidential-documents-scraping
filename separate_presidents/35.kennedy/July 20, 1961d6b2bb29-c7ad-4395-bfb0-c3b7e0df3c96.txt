Statement by the President Upon Issuing Order Assigning Major Responsibility for Civil Defense to the Secretary of Defense.
MORE THAN EVER, a strong civil defense program is vital to the Nation's security. Today, civil defense is of direct concern to every citizen and at every level of government.
In calling upon the resources of the Department of Defense to stimulate and invigorate our civil defense preparations, I am acting under the basic Federal premise that responsibility for the accomplishment of civil defense preparations at the Federal level is vested in me. In the States and localities, similar responsibilities are vested in the governors and local executives. It is my hope that they, too, will redouble their efforts to strengthen our civil defense and will work closely with the Department of Defense in its new assignment.

Civil defense, like other elements of the total non-military defense program, reaches into virtually every phase of our government and of our national life. I shall accordingly be actively concerned with the problem of coordinating our civil defense preparations with other non-military defense preparations required to achieve a strong position for our Nation. In this, I shall be represented and assisted by the Director of the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization.
Note: The White House release of which this statement is a part summarized the civil defense responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization as set forth in Executive Order 10952 "Assigning Civil Defense Responsibilities to the Secretary of Defense and Others" (26 F.R. 6577). Also released the same day was the text of a memorandum dated July 7 from the Director of OCDM, containing recommendations with respect to the civil defense and defense mobilization programs.
