Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Accelerating the Development of the Pacific Islands Trust Territory.
IT GIVES me great pleasure to sign the enrolled bill, S. 2775, which provides authorization for a substantial increase in funds for the continued administration by the United States of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
We have a great and challenging responsibility for the development of the peoples and resources of the Trust Territory and, by the passage of this legislation, the Congress has taken the first step toward providing the means whereby a new and vital phase of development may be instituted. This Administration has recognized the fundamental changes that are taking place in the outlook of the people in this area and we intend to meet this challenge with accelerated economic and social programs commensurate with the responsibilities of our stewardship.
The accelerated program that is contemplated will place great emphasis upon education for, in our opinion, education is the key to all further progress--political, economic and social. It is our hope that, with this authorization, funds will be made available to meet the urgent need for me immediate initiation of programs leading to striking improvement of education at all levels in the Trust Territory, upgrading education to a level comparable to the level which has been taken for granted in the United States for decades. At the same time, we intend to move forward, as rapidly as possible and with the cooperation and the full participation of the citizens of the Trust Territory, in all other areas requiring development.
The people of the Trust Territory, I am sure, will mark this day as the beginning of a new era of progress for the Trust Territory and its inhabitants.
Note: As enacted, S. 2775 is Public Law 87-541 (76 Stat. 171).
