Statement by the President on the Signing of Agreements To End the Conflict in Laos
The signature today at Geneva of the agreements which are to bring about a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Laos can be a significant milestone in our efforts to maintain and further world peace. It is a heartening indication that difficult, and at times seemingly insoluble international problems can in fact be solved by patient diplomacy.
The agreements represent a solemn commitment not only by the United States but by all the other signatories to ensure a free, independent and neutral Laos. This can be accomplished only by full and continued observance of the agreements by all the signatories.
The Kingdom of Laos, which has been torn for so long by fratricidal strife, now stands on the threshold of a new era. It now has the opportunity to become united and independent, free to pursue its chosen course of neutrality. The success of that policy ultimately must depend not only on the efforts of the Laotians themselves but also on the moral and material support it receives from the rest of the world. For its part, the United States assures Laos of such support as that country enters this new phase in its history.
Note: The text of the Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos and accompanying Protocol is published in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 47, pp. :259-263).
