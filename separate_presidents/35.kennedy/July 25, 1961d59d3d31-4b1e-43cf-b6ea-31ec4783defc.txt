Greetings to the People of Puerto Rico on the Ninth Anniversary of the Commonwealth.
MY CORDIAL GREETINGS and best wishes go to Governor Munoz Marin and the people of Puerto Rico on this ninth anniversary of the establishment of the Commonwealth.
The great social and economic accomplishments of the Commonwealth have evoked the admiration of your fellow-citizens throughout the United States, and, indeed, of freedom loving Americans throughout the Hemisphere.
In achieving the transition from a stagnant, low income society to a dynamic, prospering community, Puerto Rico has been a source of hope and inspiration to those of us deeply concerned with charting new courses of social progress for our Hemisphere.
What we seek to accomplish in our Alianza para el Progreso has already been accomplished to a remarkable measure in Puerto Rico. That the people of Puerto Rico have pioneered in translating objectives of social advancement, long range economic planning, equitable tax structures, improved land use and vigorous investment in education, into visible realities is undeniable proof to all citizens of the Americas of the strength and creativeness of democratic ideals.
Note: On the same day the President addressed a memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies calling attention to the unique status of Puerto Rico and pointing out that all actions affecting the Commonwealth should be consistent with its structure and basic principles.
The memorandum is published in the Federal Register (26 F.R. 6695).
