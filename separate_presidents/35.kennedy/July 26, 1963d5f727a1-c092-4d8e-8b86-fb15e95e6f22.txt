Letter Accepting Resignation of Postmaster General J. Edward Day.
Dear Ed:
It is with deep regret that I accept your resignation as Postmaster General, effective, in accordance with your wishes, on August 9, 1963.
I appreciate the sacrifice that you made when you agreed, in January 1961, to serve as Postmaster General. You brought to the position a high degree of management skill and a deep dedication to the public interest. Under your leadership, the Post Office Department has had a remarkable record of accomplishment. It has become more efficient by every standard, the service to the public has been improved, and the morale of the employees has been held high. I believe you can take pride in the achievements of your administration, and I know they will be a continual source of satisfaction.
I realize that your responsibilities to your family make your return to private life imperative, but we will miss you. With you in your new endeavors go my best wishes for your continued success.

Best personal regards.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
Note: Mr. Day served as Postmaster General from January 21, 1961, through August 9, 1963. His letter of resignation was released with the President's reply.
