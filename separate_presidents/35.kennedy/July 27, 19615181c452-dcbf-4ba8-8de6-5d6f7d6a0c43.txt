I want to send my warmest congratulations to you and to the other members of the Italian team who have achieved such a splendid mountaineering feat on Mount McKinley. This outstanding accomplishment under the most hazardous of conditions is a fine testimonial to your superb skill and fortitude. Our nation is proud to have witnessed within its own borders this conquest which has served to strengthen the ties between the United States and Italy and to earn the admiration of all of the world.
