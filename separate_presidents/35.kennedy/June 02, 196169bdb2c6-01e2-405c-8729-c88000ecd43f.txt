Joint Statement Following Discussions With President de Gaulle.
THE PRESIDENT of the United States of America paid a state visit to Paris from May 31 to June 2. This visit itself is evidence of the close and- friendly relations traditionally characteristic of the history of the two countries.
During the visit there have been long talks between General de Gaulle, President of the French Republic, and President Kennedy.
The two presidents discussed the principal issues in the present international situation with regard both to relations between the United States and France, and to their policies in all parts of the world. In the course of these discussions, which were both direct and searching, they examined the position of the two countries with regard to the Soviet Union and the communist world; and the activities of these two countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, including aid to under-developed countries. They also examined means for strengthening the Atlantic Alliance, that fundamental association of free nations.
These conversations have shown the fundamental agreement which exists between the two presidents. In particular, President de Gaulle and President Kennedy confirmed the identity of their views on their commitments and responsibilities towards Berlin.
The conversation which has just taken place allowed the President of France and the President of the United States to know each other and to set forth fully the respective position of the two countries, taking into account the interests and responsibilities incumbent upon each of them.
Thus the talks have made an essential contribution to the development of relations between France and the United States.
The deep solidarity which binds the two nations together in the tradition of Franco-American friendship remains the basis of these relations.
Note: The statement was released in Paris.
