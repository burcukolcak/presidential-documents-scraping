Remarks at SHAPE Headquarters in Paris.
General Norstad, Ambassador Finletter, officers, ladies and gentlemen:
I want to express my thanks to all of you for having been kind enough to come out in the rain and to express your good will to my country. The United States made a determination on three different occasions in this century, in 1917, in 1941, in 1948 and '49, that the security of my country must inevitably be linked with the security of a free Europe. We believe that strongly in 1961. It is for this reason that we have determined to maintain and strengthen the forces which we now have stretched across Europe, joined with you in the common defense of the freedom of this historic section of the world, whose security inevitably affects the well-being of my own country.
We are here with you, and as long as you are determined that our association with you is useful in the common cause, we shall remain, and we shall meet our commitments to the full, and we shall maintain our strength, and we shall continue to insist that here in this most ancient section of the civilized world springs the force, the vigor, the strength, and the commitment which can provide freedom, not only for this section of Europe, but also radiate around the globe.
I salute all of you who are participating in this great common event, and I hope in the years that are now ahead that this communal alliance will have even greater strength and force than it has had in past years. And I can assure you that the United States of America intends to bear its full part.

Thank you.
Note: The President's opening words referred to Gen. Lauris Norstad, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe, and Thomas K. Finletter, U.S. Permanent Representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
