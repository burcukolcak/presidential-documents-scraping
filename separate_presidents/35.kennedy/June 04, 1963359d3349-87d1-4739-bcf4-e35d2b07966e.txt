Remarks to Members of the Young Australian League.
I WANT to express a warm welcome to you. I think President Hoover received your predecessors in 1929, just before the roof fell in. I hope this visit of yours will be a happier one and a longer lasting occasion.
I have read something about this League.! I understand since 1911 you have been touring the world and learning about what is going on in offer countries, and also teaching things to people of other countries about Australia.
Your country, as I realize, is greatly admired. We regard them as among our staunchest allies. We have been through a good deal with Australia, particularly in the last 20 or 25 years. In some ways our most difficult challenges for Australia and the United States and other countries in that area of the world--our most difficult days may be ahead.
I regard the friendship between Australia and the United States, the alliance between us, essential for the security of both countries. And therefore we are particularly glad to have you, as Australians and also as young men who have demonstrated an interest not only in their own country but in the world around them. So we are very glad to have you here. You are a very good advertisement for Australia.
I have up here a picture of the boat which just happened to beat the Australians last year, but I got the impression on that occasion, as I had on previous occasions, and as I do this morning, that the future of Australia is very bright indeed. We are very happy to have you.
Note: The President spoke at 9:30 a.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House. At the close of his remarks he referred to the yacht Weatherly, victor over the Australian challenger Gretel in the America's Cup races off Newport in the fair of 1962.
