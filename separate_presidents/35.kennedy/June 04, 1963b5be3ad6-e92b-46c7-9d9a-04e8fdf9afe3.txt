Toast to President Radhakrishnan at a Luncheon at the Indian Embassy.
Mr. President:
Today the President made an outstanding speech at the World Food Congress without notes. He rode through the parade today, with tremendous cheers, without waving. He lunched today without meat. We have learned a series of valuable lessons.
Mr. President, we welcomed you here with your reputation well before and you, also, because of our high regard for your country. I must say the last 24 hours have given all of us who have been in contact with you the same warm feeling of friendship and regard as those whose interests stretch far beyond the national boundaries.
So, we welcomed you here, Mr. President, as a very valued friend not only of the United States but of the human race, of which we are a small part.
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will all join with me in drinking to the very good health of the President, coming from a country far different from ours, but it shows really what a small world it is and how much we share the same aspirations.
