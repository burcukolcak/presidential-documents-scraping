Transcript of Interview by a Correspondent of the British Broadcasting Company.
THE PRESIDENT [replying to a question regarding his stay in England]: Oh well, we have had a great trip here. In addition, as I said, we successfully baptized a godchild, and I had a chance to talk to the Prime Minister for nearly 4 hours, so it was very useful.
Q. Do you feel that because your meeting with Mr. Khrushchev was one in which Mr. Macmillan didn't take part, that the influence of this country in world affairs is very much less than what it was?
THE PRESIDENT. Oh, no-this was not intended to be a summit meeting. Mr. Macmillan himself, the Prime Minister, has seen Mr. Khrushchev on several occasions. But I bear the responsibilities as President of the United States, and I felt it important to have an exchange of views with Mr. Khrushchev, and also to make clear our position; and particularly I was--after that conversation I was anxious to see the Prime Minister.
But this was not a summit meeting but it was an opportunity to make a more precise judgment as to our future course.
Q. It has been a very short stay. I hope you will come back, sir.
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I am delighted. I appreciate that very much indeed.

Correspondent: Thank you very much.
Note: The interview was held as the President was leaving the residence of Prince and Princess Radziwill, where he stayed during his visit in London. The President referred to the baptism at Westminster Cathedral of his infant niece, Anna Christina Radziwill.
