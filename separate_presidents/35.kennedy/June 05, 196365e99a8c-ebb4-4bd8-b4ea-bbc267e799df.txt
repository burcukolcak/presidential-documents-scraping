Letter to Wilson Wyatt Following His Mediation in the Indonesian Oil Negotiations.
Dear Wilson:
Two weeks ago I asked you to undertake a most delicate and urgent mission of good offices to President Sukarno and other officials of the Government of Indonesia in connection with critical negotiations between the Indonesian Government and American oil companies operating in that country. You accepted promptly and the result has been an outstanding success. An agreement satisfactory to both sides has been achieved after negotiations in which you played an indispensable part.
In taking on this delicate and urgent assignment you have performed a most important service in the national interest. I am grateful to you.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[The Honorable Wilson W. Wyatt, Lt. Governor of Kentucky, Louisville, Ky.]
Note: The White House release accompanying the letter stated that Governor Wyatt had delivered a letter from President Sukarno to President Kennedy and that he had reported to the President that the negotiations had resulted in a mutually satisfactory agreement signed in his presence on June 1. For a statement by the President following the signing of the agreement, see Item 212.
