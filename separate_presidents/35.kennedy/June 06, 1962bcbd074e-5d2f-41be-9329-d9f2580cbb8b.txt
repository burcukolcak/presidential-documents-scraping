Joint Statement following Discussions With the President of the Republic of Cyprus.
PRESIDENT KENNEDY and President Makarios have had an extremely cordial discussion during the past two days on topics of mutual interest to their governments. The visit of Archbishop Makarios afforded an opportunity for the two Presidents to renew their acquaintance and to review a variety of subjects of common concern.
Their talks included a review of major international issues, as well as a discussion of the Government of Cyprus' efforts to achieve economic and social progress. President Kennedy restated American interest in the development program of Cyprus that is now taking shape and in assisting in its implementation.
Secretary of State Dean Rusk and foreign Minister Spyros Kyprianou also participated in the talks, as did the Cypriot Ambassador to the United States Zenon Rossides, and the American Ambassador to Cyprus, Fraser Wilkins.

The friendly and comprehensive exchange of views between President Kennedy and Archbishop Makarios has strengthened the bonds of friendship between their two countries, which are based on their common objectives of peace and progress.
