Message to Graduates of the Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and West.
Dear Grantees:
My warm congratulations to each of the students who is today completing his rich experience at the East and West Center.
The principles which guided the Government of the United States in establishing the Center are common to all of us in the community of nations now participating in this program.
I hope that all of you carry away a fuller understanding of all our various cultures, most of which are older than the United States. Equally important, I hope you carry away a better idea of the genuine warmth of friendship for other peoples on which the free world community is founded. As citizens of that community, you are, as the result of your studies here, better prepared to meet its burdens and its opportunities.

Again my heartiest congratulations.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
Note: The Center was established in Honolulu at the University of Hawaii by the Department of State pursuant to the Mutual Security Act of 1960 (74 Stat. 141) and in furtherance of the purposes of the U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (62 Stat. 6).
