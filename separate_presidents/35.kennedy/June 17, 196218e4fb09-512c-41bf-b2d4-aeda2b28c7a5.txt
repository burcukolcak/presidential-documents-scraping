[Released June 17, 1962. Dated June 13, 1962]
Your Beatitude:
Your visit here has been a source of great pleasure to me and to the people of the United States. It has given us a new appreciation of the challenges you and the Cypriot people face in building a stable country with expanding opportunities to lead richer and fuller lives. Our discussions have enabled us better to understand each other's problems, and have underscored the fact that we have many common objectives.
I am happy to reassure you of my Government's intent to help with the implementation of your program of economic development, and I look forward to the prospect of increasingly effective cooperation following your return.
May God grant you a safe journey, and a happy and prosperous future for you and the people of Cyprus.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[His Beatitude, Archbishop Makarios, President of the Republic of Cyprus]
