Remarks Recorded for a Television Program Marking Twenty- five Years of Publication of Life Magazine.
AS WE HAVE SEEN in the 25 years since Life was first printed, communications have changed dramatically. The people of our country, I think, have a greater understanding and a greater awareness of the problems that we now face as a people. There is, however, no question that in the coming months and years this communication and this understanding must constantly be increased. It will constantly be more important.
The United States is playing an increasingly significant role in the world today as the chief defender of freedom in a time of freedom's maximum danger. The entire democratic system which depends for its success upon majority rule, and therefore for majority understanding, depends in a very real sense on information and communication-for our judgment is no better than our information. The great organizations of communication, therefore, in this country, have an obligation and a responsibility unequaled in our national life, and basic to our national future.
Recently, Life magazine published a series of articles on our national purpose. I hope in the coming months and years there will be no doubt in the minds of our own people, and in the people around the world, of our national purpose, of our hopes, of our aspirations, of our determination.
We have seen tonight 25 years of tumult and change in the lives of government, science, and of the people. The next 25 years we will see changes even more drastic. The shots will be heard around the world, and in the lives of us all. It will be our responsibility as a people to make sure that 25 years from tonight the great Republic of the United States is still preserved, still secure, still strong, still purposeful.
Note: The program for which these remarks were recorded was broadcast on March 2 from 9:30 to 11 p.m.
