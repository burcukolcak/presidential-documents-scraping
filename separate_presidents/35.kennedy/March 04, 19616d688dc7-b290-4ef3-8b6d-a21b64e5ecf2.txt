Message to the Members of the National 4-H Club.
MY WARM BEST WISHES to each of you as you look forward to National 4-H Club Week, starting March 4- I would commend you especially for your achievements in leadership and citizenship. Through your emphasis on Head, Heart, Hands, and Health, you are making a valuable contribution to our country's welfare and progress. Your energy, ability, and perseverance-supported by parents, club leaders, and other public-spirited men and women--are a vital force in America's strength and growth.
Now 2 1/3 million strong, you are learning today to put science to work in your homes and on your farms. Tomorrow your training and experience will help you become leaders in your communities, States, and Nation. There you will have a great opportunity to help provide a more fruitful life for peoples at home and abroad, and to help other countries gain for themselves the peace and freedom they strive for.
I am sure we can count on you in 4-H Clubs everywhere to help us face the challenge that lies ahead. I have faith in the future as we plan and prepare for it together.
