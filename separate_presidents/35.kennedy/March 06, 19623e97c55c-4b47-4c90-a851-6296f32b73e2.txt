Message to Chairman Khrushchev Concerning the Opening of the Geneva Disarmament Negotiations.
[Released March 6, 1962. Dated March 5, 1962]
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I have received your message of March 3, and I am glad to know of your agreement that the meeting in Geneva on March 14 should be opened by foreign Ministers. I am particularly glad that Mr. Gromyko will be able to join with Lord Home and Secretary Rusk before the meeting for preliminary discussions; our hope is that these conversations might begin on March 12. It will be the purpose of the representatives of the United States, headed by Secretary Rusk, to make every possible effort to find paths toward disarmament.
Our object now must be to make real progress toward disarmament, and not to engage in sterile exchanges of propaganda. In that spirit, I shall not undertake at this time to comment on the many sentiments in your letter with which, as I am sure you know, the United States Government cannot agree. Let us, instead, join in giving our close personal support and direction to the representatives, and let us join in working for their success.
Sincerely yours,
JOHN F.KENNEDY
