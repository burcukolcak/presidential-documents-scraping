Mr. McEwen, who was accompanied by the Australian Ambassador to the United States Sir Howard Beale, reviewed with the President the importance to Australia of a number of current developments in the international trade and commodity policy fields, including developments relating to the European Economic Community, and the considerable degree of common interest of the United States and Australia on these questions.
The President and the Deputy Prime Minister agreed that an economically strong and developing Australia is essential to the best interests of both countries in the Southwest Pacific and expressed mutual confidence in the continuing close identity of view which each country shares on matters of common concern.
Mr. McEwen is on his way to Europe where he will meet representatives of the British Government and a number of European Governments for discussions on the subject of Britain's proposed entry into the European Common Market.
