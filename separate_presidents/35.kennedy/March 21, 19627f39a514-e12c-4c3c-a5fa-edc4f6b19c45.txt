[Released March 21, 1962. Dated March 13, 1962]
I CONGRATULATE you on your appointment as Governor General of Ceylon. It is my sincere wish and that of the people of the United States that you enjoy every success. Your Ambassadorship in Washington did much to reinforce the traditional bonds of friendship between our two countries. May that friendship be strengthened still further in the future. Please accept my warm personal greetings and best wishes.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
