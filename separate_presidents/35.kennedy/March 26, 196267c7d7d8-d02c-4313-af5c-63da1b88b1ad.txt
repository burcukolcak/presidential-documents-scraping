Remarks Upon Presenting a Congressional Award to Robert Frost
Ladies and gentlemen:
It's a great honor for me, speaking on behalf of the Congress and the people of the United States, to present this much deserved and rather rare action--award--to Mr. Robert frost.
I suppose in a sense he is disappointed that this was not a more controversial decision by the Congress, but instead was a unanimous one. We are proud of you, Mr. Frost--

Mr. Frost: Both parties!
THE PRESIDENT. What? Both parties--[laughter]--in fact, the only thing, really, that we have been able to agree on since you were here, in a long time.
But I think we are proud of Mr. Frost and his interpretations of what we feel is the best of America. And therefore I present this award to our very good friend.
Note: The presentation ceremony was held in the fish Room at the White House.
In his opening words the President referred to an act of Congress, approved September 13, 1960, authorizing the President "to present a gold medal to Robert frost, a New England poet."
During the ceremonies Mr. Frost gave the President an inscribed copy of his new book of poems, "In the Clearing."
