Letter to Secretary Stahr Concerning Discontinuance of Commercial Operations by the Panama Line.
[Released March 31, 1961. Dated March 29, 1961]
Dear Mr. Secretary:
I have reviewed the report on the Panama Line, prepared by the Bureau of the Budget in consultation with you and other responsible authorities. I am in accord with the views expressed that continued commercial operations of the Panama Line would not be in the public interest. You should, therefore, take appropriate measures to discontinue the Line's commercial operations by April 20, 1961 It is my desire that you investigate fully alternative transportation resources in order to select the course of action which would best serve the Government's interest and most adequately and economically meet the Canal Zone's particular transportation requirements. It is my further desire that you render appropriate assistance to those employees displaced by this action in finding other employment.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
