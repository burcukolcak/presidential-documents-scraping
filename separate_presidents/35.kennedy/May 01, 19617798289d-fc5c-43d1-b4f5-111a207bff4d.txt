Message From the President on the Occasion of the Dedication of the Inter-Faith Chapel, Kings Point, New York.
IT IS FITTING that the Inter-Faith Chapel in memory of the American seamen of all faiths who gave their lives at sea be established at Kings Point.
Erected to the Glory of God, this edifice commemorating the memory of these men, will stand as a national monument on the grounds of the United States Merchant Marine Academy where young Americans prepare to serve their country in the American Merchant Marine.

Our Nation has ever sought Divine guidance in its hours of thanksgiving and its moments of peril.
On the high seas, between heaven and the deep, men of all faiths feel a sense of brotherhood with the infinite.
May this Chapel ever inspire those who pause here to dedicate themselves to the service of their fellow men.
Note: The message, addressed to Rear Adm. Gordon McLintock, USMS, Superintendent of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, was read by John S. Stillman, Assistant to the Under Secretary of Commerce.
