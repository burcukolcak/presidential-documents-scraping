Toast of the President at a Luncheon Given in His Honor by Grand Duchess Charlotte at the Luxembourg Embassy.
Ladies and gentlemen:
I hope you will join with me in expressing our pleasure at having the opportunity of having Her Royal Highness in the United States. Her Royal Highness and her son were in our country during the days of World War II, and they are particularly welcome back now as old and faithful friends whom we look to with the greatest hopes for long and continued association.
A good many Americans are buried in their country. And I think the United States has proved, as they have proved through a much longer history, our common interests and the maintenance of our freedom and our hopes for others who look to the future the same way we do.
We have been very much heartened by your visit, Your Royal Highness. You are in a sense a historic figure and, therefore, it is a great pleasure to have you visit us.
We are glad to have your son here who fought with the American Forces and the British Forces in World War II and who was carrying on your great tradition.
Will you all join with me in drinking to the very good health of Her Royal Highness, the Grand Duchess.
Note: The President spoke following a toast to him proposed by Grand Duchess Charlotte.
