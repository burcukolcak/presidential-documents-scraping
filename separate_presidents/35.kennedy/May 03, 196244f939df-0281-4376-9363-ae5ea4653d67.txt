Letter to the President of the National Civil Service League Concerning federal Pay Reform.
[Released May 3, 1962. Dated May 2, 1962]
Dear Mr. Kelley:
It is indeed gratifying to have your letter of April 18 in which you express your support for this Administration's proposals for reform of federal policy on statutory salaries.
I certainly share your belief that the paramount personnel problems within the federal service are those that relate to the upper career ranks, both professional and managerial. It is for this reason that I have emphasized the need for establishing a fundamental principle of comparability of federal salaries with those in the private economy and for making immediate adjustments to help repair the compression in the salary scales that has taken place over the past 17 years.
It is my firm intention and the intention of those who will assist in working with the Congress on this proposed legislation to press vigorously for this reform. The heads of various federal program activities will participate in this process. It is reassuring and most helpful to know that the support of your outstanding organization on this proposal is assured. Thank you very much for your letter.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[Mr. Nicholas Kelley, National Civil Service League, 315 Fifth Avenue, New York 16, New York]
Note: Mr. Kelley's letter, dated April 18 and cosigned by Bernard L. Gladieux, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the League, was released with the President's reply.
