Statement by the President on the Death of Dr. Theodore von Karman.
IT IS with deep regret that I have learned of the death of Dr. Theodore von Karman, to whom only last February I awarded the first National Medal of Science. Dr. von Karman was known to the world scientific community as the father of aerodynamics and as the Chairman of the Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development to NATO which he organized 10 years ago. I know his friends and associates will mourn his loss and join me in paying tribute to a great scientist and humanitarian.
