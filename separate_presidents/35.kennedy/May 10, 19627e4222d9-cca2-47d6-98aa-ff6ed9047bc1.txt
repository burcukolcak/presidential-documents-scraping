Remarks on Plans for a Permanent Scientific and Industrial Exposition in Washington.
I AM PLEASED to learn of the progress that you representatives of many of the Nation's leading industrial and commercial companies have made in furthering the idea of establishing a permanent exposition of United States science and industry in the Washington area.
It seems to me that a permanent exposition in the Nation's Capital is an appropriate means of demonstrating to the many visitors that come to this city, especially school children, the manner in which our Nation's industrial complex operates. Such a project would also provide a means for foreign visitors to this country to familiarize themselves with the complexity and inter-relationship of this country's industrial operations.
One of the most appealing features of this undertaking is that it has been initiated and will be financed by private industry. As I understand it, your association is arranging for feasibility studies to determine the best format, the best site, and the best financing arrangements for an exposition--this strikes me as reasonable initial steps. And I am glad to see leaders of the city of Washington here also since it seems clear that an undertaking of this character if located in Washington must have the support and cooperation of the local community. You have the encouragement of this administration, and we hope that your efforts will be as successful as your hopes.
Note: The President spoke at 10:25 a.m. in his office at the White House. The group, an interim study committee composed of 21 representatives of industry and education, met on May 10 and again on October 30 to develop plans for an exposition which would demonstrate the character and vitality of the American free enterprise system.
