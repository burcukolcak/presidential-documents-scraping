Joint Statement With Prime Minister Pearson Concerning the Roosevelt Cottage on Campobello Island.
THE PRESIDENT and the Prime Minister received a very generous offer from the Hammer family to donate the Roosevelt cottage and surrounding grounds on Campobello island to the two countries to be used for public purposes which would appropriately commemorate that great President and good friend of Canada. The Prime Minister and the President, after consulting Premier Robichaud of New Brunswick where the island is situated, have accepted the offer with deep appreciation.
Note: Campobello, on Campobello Island, New Brunswick, Canada, served for many years as the summer home of Franklin D. Roosevelt and it was there in August 1921 that he was taken ill with infantile paralysis. In 1952 the cottage, with 29 acres of ground, was purchased by Dr. Armand Hammer of Los Angeles, Calif. Dr. Hammer and his brothers, Harry and Victor, copartners of Hammer Galleries in New York City, gave the property to the United States and Canada with the hope that it would be used as a meeting place for conferences to further strengthen the relationship between the two countries.
The joint statement was released at Hyannis, Mass.
