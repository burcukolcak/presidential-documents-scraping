Remarks at the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa.
Ambassador and Mrs. Merchant, ladies and gentlemen:
I want to express my appreciation to you for your generous welcome. I also want to express our country's appreciation to you for the work that you are doing, representing our country in this friendly country of Canada.
I must say that those of you -who work for the State Department may frequently feel that they are relatively unappreciated. I must say Presidents sometimes have that feeling also. But I do feel that in these very difficult and hazardous days that the work that you are doing, which involves very intimately the security of the country, that you are fulfilling your responsibility as citizens to the highest. And I think that anyone who has that opportunity in these days is to be envied.
So I express to you our commendation. It is not always pleasant to move from station to station around the world, especially if you have young children, which I am happy to say you have. But nevertheless I think you serve not only our country but the cause of freedom.
I also want to express our appreciation to the Canadians. I hope that they feel that they are serving their own country when they come and help us here in this Embassy.
The ties that bind Canada and the United States are so intimate, are so long-based in history and a common interest, that I am sure that you feel a sense of mutual service to the cause of this great North American continent.
So, thank you for your generous reception, and I must say I am glad to be here.
Note: The President spoke at 9:20 a.m. In his opening words he referred to Livingston T. Merchant, U.S. Ambassador to Canada, and Mrs. Merchant.
