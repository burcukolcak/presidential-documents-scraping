Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House Transmitting Bill Amending the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act
Dear Mr.___________:
Since the enactment of the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act of 1958 we have had an opportunity to study its operation and effect. This has disclosed several serious deficiencies. I am transmitting herewith for appropriate consideration by the Congress a draft bill designed to correct these deficiencies.
The proposed legislation will give the Secretary of Labor the investigative and enforcement authority which he needs to implement the legislation and make it effective. In addition, it will authorize the Secretary of Labor to provide uniform interpretations and clarify existing ambiguities.
The Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act is designed to prevent repetition of abuses and irregularities in the administration of employee benefit plans. I believe these amendments are necessary to carry out that purpose.
The enclosed letter from the Secretary of Labor and the explanatory statement attached to the proposal describe the measure in detail.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
