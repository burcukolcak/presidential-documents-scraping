Statement by the President Announcing a forthcoming White House Conference on Narcotics.
I WISH to announce that a White House Conference on Narcotics will be held late this summer. The problems arising out of the use of narcotics and other habit-forming drugs are many and varied including those of law enforcement, the treatment to be accorded addicts, post treatment procedures and perhaps most importantly an accurate and up-to-date assessment of the particular nature and magnitude of addiction in the United States. It is our intention to bring to the Conference, national authorities and leaders, including those in federal, State and local governments, to better understand the facets of addiction and to formulate a course of action designed to cope more effectively with this national problem area.
The Attorney General will serve as General Chairman of the Conference. I have discussed this proposal with Governor Brown of California and Mayor Wagner of New York City who represent two jurisdictions where drug addiction is especially prevalent and they agree that such a conference could be most helpful. Many other government officials including Members of the Congress from those two areas have also urged that a conference be held.
Note: for the President's remarks to the White House Conference on Narcotic and Drug Abuse, see Item 411.
