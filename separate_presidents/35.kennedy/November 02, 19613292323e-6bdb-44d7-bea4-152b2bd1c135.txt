Statement by the President in Support of the Reelection of Robert F. Wagner as Mayor of New York City.
I WANT to take this opportunity to state with the utmost conviction my whole-hearted support for the re-election of Mayor Robert F. Wagner.
His experience in coping with the problems of this great city cannot be matched. I have visited with him many times, not only during this year in the White House but earlier as well--for he was of great help to me in my own campaign. On each occasion I have been impressed with his insight into the needs of this city and the problems and opportunities of all its people.
Moreover, during this past year I have worked closely with Mayor Wagner on a number of federal-city problems; and I am counting on continuing this close relationship in the future. Many of our most important efforts in achieving greater progress for this nation involve the city of New York: providing better housing, ending the pollution of its air and water, attacking the congestion of its major streets and highways, and aiding the employment of all its citizens, to cite only a few examples. I hope I can continue to Work with Mayor Wagner who shares my philosophy on these issues.
New York is, moreover, a unique asset to all the country--as a home for the U.N., as a port of entry to visitors and immigrants.
In short, our efforts nationally to strengthen our economy, the opportunities of our citizens and our stature abroad can be complete only if those same efforts are going ahead in this city, under a Mayor with those same convictions. That is why I am glad that you have in the New York Mayor's office a man of Bob Wagner's ability; and I am sure New York will do its duty in keeping him there.
