Message to Adlai Stevenson Following the Election of U Thant as U.N. Secretary General.
THE ELECTION of U Thant is a splendid achievement in which the whole world can rejoice.
Please express the congratulations of the United States Government to the UN membership for the unanimous action in electing so distinguished a diplomat to succeed the late Dag Hammarskjold.
In preserving the integrity of the office of the UN Secretary General, they have reaffirmed this dedication to the UN Charter.
To U Thant, please express my personal congratulations, and assure him on behalf of the people of the United States that, as he begins one of the world's most difficult jobs, he has our confidence and our prayers.
I also wish to thank you and your associates for the devoted and successful service you have given your country during these difficult weeks.
