Statement by the President on the Conclusion of Atmospheric Nuclear Tests in the Pacific.
THE MEDIUM altitude shot fired this morning off Johnston Island concludes our present atmospheric test series in the Pacific. Underground nuclear weapons tests, free from fall-out, are continuing in Nevada.
I hope that in the next months we can conclude an effective test ban treaty, so that the world can be free from all testing. Agreement in this area would be an important first step toward our continuing goal of workable disarmament arrangements which can cut down the threat of war. Last March 2 I offered to stop further nuclear tests, if the Soviet Union would accept an effectively verified test ban treaty. This offer still stands. We shall devote our best efforts to conclude such a treaty and hope all others will do the same.
