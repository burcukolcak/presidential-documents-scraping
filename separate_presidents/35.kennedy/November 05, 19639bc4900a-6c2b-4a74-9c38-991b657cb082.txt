Remarks to Members of the U.S. Industrial Payroll Savings Committee.
Gentlemen:
I want to express my thanks to all of you-particularly to your chairman, Mr. Geneen, for the effort that he has made--and all of you have made this year.
This has been the most successful campaign since 1945 and, as all of you know very well from your own experience, these things do not just happen; they are made to happen, and it has required a good deal of effort by your chairman and by all of you, and we are very grateful to you.
I think we will have 1 1/2 million new participants in this program by the end of the year. And, as the Secretary of the Treasury has said, it assists us in maintaining our debt management policies, and it also assists the people involved. It gives them a greater security, a greater participation in the wellbeing of this country. So, from every point of view this program is worthwhile. It deserves the time you put into it.
I want to express my very sincere thanks to all of you and the companies you represent which led the way, as the figures show. We are very glad that Mr. Milliken has agreed to undertake this responsibility for the coming year. So, as always, if you want something done, you find the busiest men to do it and, in these two cases, this example has been proven and it will be proved again next year.

Thank you.
Note: The President spoke at 4 p.m. in the Flower Garden at the White House. During his remarks he referred to Harold S. Geneen, president of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, the 1963 chairman of the Committee, and to the chairman for 1964, Frank R. Milliken, president of the Kennecott Copper Corporation. The U.S. Industrial Payroll Savings Committee is made up of industrial leaders who promote the sale of savings bonds in the industries.
Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon accompanied the group to the White House.
