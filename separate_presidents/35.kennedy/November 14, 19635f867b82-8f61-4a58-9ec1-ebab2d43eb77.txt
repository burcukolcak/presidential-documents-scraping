Statement by the President in Response to Report of the National Committee on Health Care of the Aged.
I AM very pleased to have the report on financing health care of the aged prepared by the bipartisan National Committee on Health Care of the Aged under the sponsorship of Senators Anderson and Javits.
The thoughtful proposals of this expert group of leaders from medicine, education, industry, and insurance should prove extremely helpful in our effort to obtain action in the Congress on this vital matter. I was very pleased to see that the report endorses the fundamental principle of financing certain basic health costs of our older citizens through the social security system; and I look forward to working with the members and sponsors of this Committee in ending the long neglect of this growing national problem. This report makes sure the enactment by this Congress of this badly needed legislation.
Note: The statement was released following a meeting of the Committee with the President in his office at the White House. Also present were Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York and Senator Clinton P. Anderson of New Mexico.
The 12-member committee was established in 1962 under the chairmanship of Arthur S. Flemming, president of the University of Oregon and Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare under President Eisenhower. The committee's report is entitled "A National Program for Financing Health Care of the Aged: Guiding Principles for Complementary Public and Private Action" (New York City, 1963, 62 pp.).
