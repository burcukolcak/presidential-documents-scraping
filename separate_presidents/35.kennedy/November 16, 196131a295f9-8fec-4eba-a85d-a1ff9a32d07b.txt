Remarks Upon Arrival at Boeing Airfield, Seattle.
Governor, Mr. Mayor, my colleagues/tom the Senate:
It is a great pleasure and honor to come to this State, on the 100th anniversary of the University of Washington, the 25th anniversary of Senator Magnuson, and the first anniversary of my election to the Presidency.
It is a source of satisfaction to me to have the opportunity to visit, in that capacity, for the first time, the Northwest United States, and particularly to come to this State at this time when so many happy occasions are combined.

Thank you.
Note: The President's opening words referred to Albert D. Rosellini, Governor of Washington; Gordon S. Clinton, Mayor of Seattle; and Warren G. Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson, U.S. Senators from Washington.
