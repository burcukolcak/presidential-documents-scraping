Message to Mrs. Niels Bohr Upon the Death of Her Husband.
I AM deeply saddened by the news of the death of Dr. Bohr. The scientists of the United States, and indeed all Americans, who knew him and his accomplishments, have held him in the highest respect for more than two generations. His great achievements in the quantum theory of the atom have been basic to modern advances in physical science. The scientific inspiration he brought in his many visits to this country, and especially his great services at Los Alamos during the war, leave us forever in his debt.
Please accept my condolences and deepest sympathy.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[Mrs. Niels Bohr, Copenhagen, Denmark]
