Statement by the President on Establishing the President's Commission on Campaign Costs.
ELECTION of the President of the United States is the supreme test of the democratic process in this country. Because the duly nominated candidates of both our national parties must campaign throughout the country, carrying their views to all the nation's voters, there are great financial burdens in conducting Presidential campaigns. To have Presidential candidates dependent on large financial contributions of those with special interests is highly undesirable, especially in these days when the public interest requires basic decisions so essential to our national security and survival. The financial base of our Presidential campaigns must be broadened.
Among the services which must be paid for are staff assistance, transportation and communication facilities, radio and television time. Under present circumstances these items are enormously expensive, and thus the ability of candidates to carry on campaigns is, in large measure, governed by their success as fund raisers.
Traditionally, the funds for national campaigns have been supplied entirely by private contributions, with the candidates forced to depend in the main on large sums from a relatively small number of contributors. It is not healthy for the democratic process--or for ethical standards in our government--to keep our national candidates in this condition of dependence. I have long thought that we must either provide a Federal share in campaign costs, or reduce the cost of campaign services, or both.
My Commission on Campaign Costs will take a fresh look at this problem, and will make such recommendations as it deems appropriate, looking toward proposals for the next session of Congress.
A Federal share in Presidential campaign costs has been under public discussion for a great many years. President Theodore Roosevelt was among the first to propose that Presidential campaigns be assisted by the government. Comparable proposals have been advocated subsequently by private citizens and by Members of the Congress, notably by the late Senator Neuberger of Oregon. Several such proposals are contained in bills pending in the current Congress. I am asking the Commission to inform itself on all of these as it conducts its study. In addition, I am asking the Commission to examine programs actually employed by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and by several democratic countries overseas in which governments participate in financing political campaigns. Finally, I expect that the Commission will consider a variety of other measures used in this country and elsewhere for facilitating campaigns, among them the permissive legislation which made possible last year's television debates without cost to the candidates.
As I made plain in a press conference last May, I regard the inquiry to be undertaken by this Commission as a matter of great importance. I am grateful to the distinguished members of the Commission for their willingness to serve. I look forward to the results of their inquiry.
Note: The statement was issued as part of a White House release announcing that the President had named Alexander Heard, Dean of the Graduate School at the University of North Carolina, to serve as Chairman of the Commission on Campaign Costs. Other members of the Commission were listed in the release as follows: V. O. Key, Cambridge, Mass., Professor of Government, Harvard University; Dan Kimball, Los Angeles, Calif., President, Aerojet-General Corporation, former Secretary of the Navy; Malcolm Moos, New York City, Adviser to the Rockefeller Brothers on Public Affairs, Professor of Political Science, Johns Hopkins University, former Administrative Assistant to President Eisenhower; Paul Porter, Washington, D.C., member of law firm of Arnold, Porter, and Fortas, former Chairman, Federal Communications Commission; Neil Staebler, Ann Arbor, Mich., small businessman, Democratic National Committeeman from Michigan, former Chairman, Michigan Democratic State Central Committee; Walter Thayer, New York City, President, New York Herald-Tribune, former Chairman, United Republican Finance Committee of New York, National Finance Chairman of Volunteers for Nixon-Lodge; John Vorys, Columbus, Ohio, member of law firm of Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease, former Member of the United States House of Representatives; James Worthy, Chicago, Ill., President, Republican Citizens of Illinois, former President, United Republican Fund of Illinois, former Assistant Secretary of Commerce in the Eisenhower Administration, former Vice President, Sears Roebuck and Company.
On November 9 the White House announced that the members of the Commission had met with the President, and that the President had asked the Commission to report to him not later than April 30, 1962. The release also stated that Dr. Herbert E. Alexander, Director of the Citizens Research Foundation, Princeton, N.J., would serve as the Commission's Executive Director.
