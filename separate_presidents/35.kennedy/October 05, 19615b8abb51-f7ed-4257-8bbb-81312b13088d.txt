Statement by the President Announcing Further Progress in the Voluntary Desegregation of Schools.
FOR THE third time this fall I have the good fortune to call the attention of the nation to the progress which is being made in the peaceful and voluntary desegregation of our schools in compliance with the mandate of the Constitution.
This week, after months of work by the school board and other officials in Memphis, Tennessee, four schools in that city were peacefully desegregated in compliance with the law and without disorder. This was again the fruit of mutual respect and cooperation by the leaders of both races and by public and forthright support by the Mayor, the Commissioner of Police, business leaders, and other citizens for the action of the Memphis School Board.
In New Orleans last month, following the developments in Atlanta, Dallas, Little Rock and many other cities in the South, there was a new demonstration by the people of that city of their respect for law and of their acceptance of the necessity and wisdom of orderly compliance with the command of the law.
The way in which our citizens are meeting their responsibilities under the law in Memphis, New Orleans and elsewhere reflects credit on the United States throughout the world.
