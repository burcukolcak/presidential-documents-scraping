Letters to Mayor Wagner and to Robert Moses Concerning the New York World's Fair.
Dear Mayor Wagner:
I appreciated having your letter of September 29 and to learn of the excellent progress being made in preparation for the New York World's Fair of 1964-65. Pledges of participation on the part of 64 nations is indeed gratifying. I am fully aware of your own personal interest and efforts on behalf of a fair which will do credit not only to New York City but to the Nation.
As you know, the Congress has considered legislation in the last session which would authorize studies as to the nature and extent of participation in the New York World's Fair by the Federal Government. Both the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce supported this legislation before the Committees of Congress. In anticipation of favorable action on this legislation I transmitted to the Congress an appropriation request to make a thorough study of this matter. I know that the Congress will give this matter its fullest consideration at the next session.
A fair of the magnitude and character which you have planned has great potential for promoting international good will and understanding and should do much to promote additional travel from foreign countries. These are objectives in which both the City of New York and the Federal Government can join.

Best wishes.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[Honorable Robert F. Wagner, Mayor of New York, New York, New York]
Dear Mr. Moses:
I have written the Mayor assuring him of my support of the World's Fair, which under your direction and leadership will be, I am sure, most successful. You can be certain of my continued interest and the support of the Administration.

I hope to be with you at the ribbon cutting.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY

[Mr. Robert Moses, President, New York World's Fair 1964-65 Corporation, Administration Building, World's Fair, Flushing, New York]
