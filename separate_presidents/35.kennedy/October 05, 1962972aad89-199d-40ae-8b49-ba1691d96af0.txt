John F. Kennedy
October 05, 1962

Remarks Upon Arrival at Metropolitan Airport, Detroit.
Governor Swainson; Neil Staebler, who I hope is going to be the Congressman at Large from the State of Michigan; your distinguished Congressman and a former colleague o/mine, Congressman Lesinski; your distinguished Congressman from this area of the State, Congressman Ryan; Congressman Dingell; Congressman Nedzi; ladies and gentlemen:
This is not a nonpolitical trip; it's a political trip in the sense that we have come here to Michigan in order to talk to the Democrats of this State who on many occasions, both in this State and in the country, have stood up for progress. And that's why we're back in Michigan tonight, to join you in a campaign to reelect a distinguished Governor who has been carrying the banner in this State formerly borne by the present Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, Soapy Williams, and we're here tonight in a State which has sent two great Senators, Pat McNamara and Phil Hart, who stand for progress on the floor of the United States Senate; and your Congressmen.
Michigan, which is a great industrial State in this country, I believe has its best years ahead. And I come here tonight to ask your help in electing the kind of men who believe in moving this country forward.

Thank you very much.
Note: In his opening words the President referred to John B. Swainson, Governor of Michigan; Neil Staebler, Democratic candidate for Congressman at Large from Michigan; and John Lesinski, Harold M. Ryan, John D. Dingell, and Lucien N. Nedzi, U.S. Representatives from Michigan. Later he referred to U.S. Senators Pat McNamara and Philip A. Hart of Michigan.
