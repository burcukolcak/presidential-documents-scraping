Statement by the President Following Receipt of a Supplementary Report on the Airline Labor Problem.
I HAVE today received the supplemental report of the Commission I established to consider the airlines controversy which tied up practically all major air carriers earlier this year. This report contains detailed recommendations for settlement of the dispute amplifying the Commission's May 24, 1961 report.
This report is a result of long, diligent, and objective study. The recommendations are concurred in by the Secretary of Labor and appear to me to be fair and equitable to the parties, and an honorable way to a peaceful settlement of a difficult inter-union dispute which has plagued the airline industry for years.
I am sure that the public joins with me in urging the pilots, the flight engineers, and the carriers to seriously consider and follow the Commission's recommendations so that a new era of labor peace can be achieved in the industry.
I should deeply appreciate it if the Commission will remain available to receive reports from the parties as to their progress in implementing the Commission's recommendations and transmitting such reports to me with the Commission's observations.
Professor Nathan P. Feinsinger, the Commission chairman, and his associates, Professors Richard A. Lester and J. Keith Mann, are to be commended for their work on a most difficult and taxing problem. They have performed an outstanding public service.
Note: The "Report to the President by the Commission Established by Executive Order 10921, dated February 21, 1961 [26 F.R. 1553], as Amended, To Consider Differences That Have Arisen Between Certain Air Carriers and Certain of Their Employees," dated May 24, 1961 (31 PP.), and the supplemental report, dated October 17, 1961 (15 pp.), were published by the Government Printing Office.
