Message to President Diem on the Occasion of the National Holiday of Viet-Nam.
[ Released October 25, 1963. Dated October 23, 1963 ]
Dear Mr. President:
On behalf of the American people I extend greetings and best wishes to the Republic of Viet-Nam on its 8th anniversary. On this occasion I wish once again to express the admiration of the American people for the unfailing courage of the Vietnamese people in their valiant struggle against the continuing efforts of communism to undermine and destroy Vietnamese independence. The United States of America has confidence in the future of the Republic of Viet-Nam, in its ability both to overcome the present communist threat to their independence, and to determine their own destiny. We look forward to the day when peace is restored and when the Vietnamese people can live in freedom and prosperity.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
