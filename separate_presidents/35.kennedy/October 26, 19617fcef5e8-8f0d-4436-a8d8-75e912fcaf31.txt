Letter to Henry B. Gonzalez in Support of His Candidacy in Texas.
[Released October 26, 1961 Dated October 25, 1961]
Dear Senator Gonzalez:
It gives me great pleasure to join with Vice President Johnson and your other friends and good Democrats in Texas, in expressing my confidence in your candidacy for U.S. Representative for the 20th

Texas district. Your awareness of national responsibilities, your concern with the problems and opportunities of the people of your. district, and your courage in performing the duties of public office are well known to your friends.
Through the years the people of San Antonio and Bexar County have repeatedly called upon men of our Party to serve them in the United States Congress. You are indeed fortunate to aspire to succeed a distinguished public servant, whom I have had the honor to appoint a judge, a fine son of Texas and exemplary citizen, Paul J. Kilday. Vice President Johnson and I will always be most grateful for the confidence shown to our Party by the citizens of the 20th district.
I want to wish you every success in your campaign and extend my warmest regards to yourself and your family.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[Honorable Henry B. Gonzalez, Houston Building, San Antonio, Tex.]
Note: Mr. Gonzalez was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives on November 4, 1961.
