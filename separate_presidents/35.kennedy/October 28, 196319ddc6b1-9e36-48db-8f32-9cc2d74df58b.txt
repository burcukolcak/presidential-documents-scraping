Statement by the President on the Death of Tom Connally.
I HAVE learned today with great regret of the passing of former Senator Tom Connally of Texas. As Chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Connally played an influential part in guiding the legislation that did so much in the difficult days following World War II to redress the balances on the side of freedom--the Truman Doctrine, NATO, the Marshall plan and Point Four.
During his 36 years on the Hill, the Senator served his State and Nation with great distinction. He played an important role in the creation of the United Nations, recognizing it as an organization that would contribute much to the cause of world peace for which he strove so diligently.
