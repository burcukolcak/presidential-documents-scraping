Message to President Gursel Following His Election Under the New Turkish Constitution.
Dear Mr. President:
I congratulate you on your election as President of the Republic of Turkey. I also wish to congratulate, in the name of the United States Government and its people, the Turkish Government and people for their success in promulgating a new constitution and in establishing a freely-elected Grand National Assembly.
As you assume your Presidential responsibilities, let me assure you of my country's dedication to the firm friendship and cooperation which have consistently characterized Turco-American relations. We are united in our aims of preserving the security of our homelands and creating a world where mankind can live in peace and freedom. In these cherished causes, we are proud to work side by side with the Government and people of Turkey.
Please accept my warmest greetings and best wishes.

Sincerely,
