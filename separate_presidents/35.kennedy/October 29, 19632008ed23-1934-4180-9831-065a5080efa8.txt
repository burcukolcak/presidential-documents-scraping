Message to President Gursel on the 40th Anniversary of the Republic of Turkey.
[ Released October 29, 1963. Dated October 25, 1963 ]
I SEND warm greetings to you and the Turkish people on this fortieth anniversary of the founding of the Republic.
The United States is proud of its association with Turkey in an alliance that rests on common aspirations and mutual interests. The American people admire the resolute spirit and manifest courage of the Turkish people in facing the trials of the postwar years and in their forthright attack on the problems of economic and social development which will determine Turkey's future. To this end, we welcome Turkey's new five-year development program, and wish it the fullest success.
In the sixteen years since the declaration of the Truman Doctrine, we have actively supported the steadfast efforts of Turkey to develop its military and economic strength. We will continue to hold firmly to this policy of cooperation, which has so greatly advanced our common interests and added so much to the defensive strength of the free world.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
