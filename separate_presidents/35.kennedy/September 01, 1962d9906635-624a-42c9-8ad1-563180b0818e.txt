Letter to Senate and House Minority Leaders on U.S. Information Activities Relating to Berlin.
Gentlemen:
I fully appreciate the concern expressed in your letter of August 31st about the Berlin wall. There can be no disagreement among Americans, nor among free men anywhere else about the meaning of that wall. Your own strong feelings are shared by me, by my Administration, and by governments and peoples in every continent.
Your specific suggestions are constructive, and I ask that any which have not been acted upon be examined afresh. I am attaching a memorandum on steps which have been taken this past year to insure world-wide understanding of the issues involved. I am sure you will agree that it shows an energetic effort and a gratifying response.
If, after studying this memorandum, you have further suggestions to make, I would be glad to have them. It is important to peace and to the freedom of the brave people of West Berlin that it be understood in every capital that on this matter we, as a Nation, are united in our determination.

Sincerely yours,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
Note: This is the text of identical letters addressed to the Honorable Everett M. Dirksen, Minority Leader of the Senate, and to the Honorable Charles A. Halleck, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.
The memorandum transmitted by the President and dated August 31 (2 pp.; unsigned) summarized the activities of the U.S. Information Service from the time of the erection of the wall in Berlin to date. It was released with the President's letter at Newport, R.I.
