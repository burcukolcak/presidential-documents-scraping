Statement by the President on the Peaceful Integration of Schools in the South and Southwest.
THE PEACEFUL INTEGRATION of many schools in the South and Southwest yesterday and today, following similar developments in Atlanta last week, is a dramatic demonstration of the progress that the United States is making in improving the position of Negroes in our society. The important thing is that there is progress and that law and order and dignity have prevailed.
In Dallas, Texas, the Citizens Council, working closely with Negro leaders, has shown again how responsible, level-headed leadership can weld a whole community together to solve a difficult problem in race relations. Little Rock and Dallas and other communities in Arkansas, Texas, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee have given the world a convincing demonstration of the American people's respect for the law which is fundamental in the maintenance of our rights as free men and Women.
I wish to congratulate the officials of these cities and states and parents and citizens who have given so much time, effort and leadership in moving their communities and America forward. But most of all I would like to congratulate the children of both races for their mutual tolerance, good will and exemplary conduct.
