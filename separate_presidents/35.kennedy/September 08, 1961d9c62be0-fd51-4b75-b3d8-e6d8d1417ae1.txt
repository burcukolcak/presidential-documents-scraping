Statement by the President in Support of Bill Providing for Payment of Philippine War Damages.
I REGRET that the bill (H.R. 8617) to compensate Philippine citizens for World War II damage to their property has been held over until next year by the House because of the press of other business.
We had hoped that this long-delayed recognition of the staunch contribution of our Philippine allies, through the satisfaction of their claims, would receive Congressional approval this year. However, the Administration continues to give wholehearted support to such legislation and is hopeful that it will be approved by the Congress early in the next session.
