John F. Kennedy
September 11, 1962

Remarks on Arrival at the International Airport in Houston.
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Vice President, Congressman Thomas, Mr. Webb, who directs the NASA program, Congressman Miller, the Chairman, and ladies and gentlemen:
I want to express our very warm appreciation on behalf of us all for your welcome here. I don't know whether the people of the Southwest realize what a profound effect this whole space program is going to have on this most progressive city and State. The scientists and engineers and technicians who are going to be attracted to this great Space Center can really remake the industrial life of the southwest United States as we reach towards the moon.
I think it's most appropriate that this Space Center should be located here in Houston, here at Rice University--a city which has been identified with progress in this State and county.
So we come here today to see what is being planned for the future, because from this place in America are going to be laid the plans and the designs which will reach out in this decade and put Americans on the moon and bring them back again. And for the time being, I'm glad to be here in Houston to take part in this activity.
Note: The President spoke as he arrived for an inspection tour of the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Tex. His opening words referred to Lewis Cutter, Mayor of Houston, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Representative Albert Thomas of Texas, James E. Webb, Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Representative George P. Miller of California, Chairman of the Science and Astronautics Committee of the House of Representatives.
