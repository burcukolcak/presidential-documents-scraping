Statement by the President on the Need for Federal Power Transmission Lines for the Upper Colorado and Trinity Projects.
I APPROVE wholeheartedly the action of the House Appropriations Committee last week in approving funds requested by the Administration to construct Federal backbone transmission lines to market power generated at the Upper Colorado Project and the Trinity Project in California. In order to insure that the Federal investment in these projects will benefit the general public and to insure that the generated power will be delivered to points where both public and private agencies are able realistically to purchase and distribute this power, Federal transmission lines are necessary. The breadth of the support for this principle is evidenced by the strong Congressional action in authorizing the. Upper Colorado Transmission System of 1956, by the recommendation of the Eisenhower Administration in January of this year, and by the vigorous advocacy of the same concept by this Administration through the Secretary of the Interior.
I believe this project to be fundamental to a sound power policy and sincerely hope the Congress will approve the appropriations items recommended by the House Appropriations Committee.
