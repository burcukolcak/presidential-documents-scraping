Remarks at the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston.
Doctor, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Webb.
I want to express my thanks to you for this model which I will take back to the White House, and which will remind us of this most extraordinary effort which is being made by all the men here and their companions scattered across the country in NASA, in private industry, in universities, all of whom are united in this extraordinary enterprise.
To talk of placing a tremendous rocket outside the orbit of the earth, to send it to the moon to rendezvous, to go to the moon's surface, to put men on the moon, to take them off, to rendezvous again, and bring them back to earth safely, and to talk about doing that in the next 5 or 6 years indicates how far and how fast we have come and how far and how fast we must go. And back of all the extraordinary scientific and technical accomplishments which must be made to make this possible, of course, are the men who are involved, and particularly those who are at the point of the sphere, those who must fly this mission into the most unknown sea.
So we commend them and all who are associated in putting them there.

Thank you.
Note: The President spoke in the Rich Building. His opening words referred to Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, and James E. Webb, Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
