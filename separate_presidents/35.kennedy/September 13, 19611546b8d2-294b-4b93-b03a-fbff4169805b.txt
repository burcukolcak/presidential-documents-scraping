Letter to the Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, Concerning the Dedication of the Brookhaven Synchrotron.
[Released September 13, 1961 Dated September 12, 1961]
Dear Dr. Seaborg:
I understand that on Wednesday, September 13, 1961, the new Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at the Brookhaven National Laboratory will be dedicated. The completion of this machine--the largest high energy particle accelerator in the world--represents a significant scientific accomplishment on the part of Brookhaven National Laboratory. The nation is justly proud of this achievement. By means of this and similar instruments of science, the United States, in cooperation with scientists throughout the world, is making substantial strides toward man's greater understanding of the properties and interactions of fundamental particles from which all matter is composed.
I am informed that the Commission will be represented at the dedication ceremonies by Commissioner Leland Haworth. Perhaps he would be kind enough to convey to Dr. Maurice Goldhaber, Director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and to all the scientists and engineers who participated in this great step forward, my sincere congratulations.

Sincerely yours,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[The Honorable Glenn T. Seaborg, Chairman, United States Atomic Energy Commission, Washington 25, D.C.]
Note: The Brookhaven National Laboratory, located at Upton, Long Island, N.Y., is a research and development facility operated by the Atomic Energy Commission.
