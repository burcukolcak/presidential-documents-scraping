John F. Kennedy
September 14, 1962

Statement by the President on the Passage by the House of Representatives of the U.N. Bond Purchase Bill.
I AM most heartened by the passage by the House tonight of the United Nations Bond Issue.
The bi-partisan nature of the vote was a demonstration of the commitment that all Americans have for the future of the United Nations as an instrument devoted to preserving peace throughout the world.
Note: The statement was released at Newport, R.I.
For the President's remarks upon signing the bill, see Item 424.
