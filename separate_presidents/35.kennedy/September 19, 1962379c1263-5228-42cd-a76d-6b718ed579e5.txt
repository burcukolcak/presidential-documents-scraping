Statement by the President Announcing an Agreement in the Aerospace Industry Labor Dispute.
I AM PLEASED to announce that the United Aerospace Workers (UAW) and North American Aviation, Inc., have reached an agreement in principle on all the remaining issues in dispute based upon the recommendations of the President's Aerospace Board.
The parties will continue to meet for the purpose of translating the agreement upon principles into specific and detailed contract language. The parties have every expectation of completing their work within the next few days and the old agreement will continue in effect until the new agreement is ratified by the Union's membership. Both the union and the company have expressed their appreciation for the assistance of William E. Simkin, Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and of Walter A. Maggiolo, the Service's Director of Mediation Activities.

It is gratifying that both parties in this dispute were able to alter their positions sufficiently to bring about a mutually acceptable agreement on the principles for a new contract. Unquestionably, they have served the public interest by insuring continuous production of aerospace equipment at their facilities.
Mr. Simkin also informs me that General Dynamics (Convair Division) and the International Association of Machinists, negotiating with the assistance of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in San Diego, California, have just reached general agreement on the basic guidelines of the Presidential Aerospace Board's report and the Union has announced that this eliminates any strike action at the production and missile site facilities of that Company.
I strongly urge the remaining companies and unions still negotiating in this industry to display the same sense of responsibility to the public interest.
