Statement by the President: National Science Youth Month.
SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS is the concern of each of us. The growth of our scientific effort has placed the growth of the Nation's strength in terms of health, economy, and security, and has contributed benefits to all mankind. The diversity, vitality, and high standards of American science today are one of our brightest promises for the future.
Fulfilling that promise depends to a large extent on our efforts in encouraging the scientific interests of young persons of ability. Scientific talent is a resource which must be developed to the fullest. Observance of National Science Youth Month which recognizes the achievements of high school students and their teachers, is sponsored by 38 national scientific, educational, industrial, and governmental groups.
I hope the observance will further stimulate young people in every area of education, and encourage all citizens to help develop a vital national asset.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
