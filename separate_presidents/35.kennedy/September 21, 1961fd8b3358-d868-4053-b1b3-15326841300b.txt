Remarks Upon Signing the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act.
I AM DELIGHTED to sign the new Fulbright-Hays Act. This ceremony has historic significance because it marks full recognition by the Congress of the importance of a more comprehensive program of educational and cultural activities as a component of our foreign relations.
The varied pieces of legislation, beginning with the Fulbright Act of 1946, following through with the Smith-Mundt bill and others, have now been gathered together and expanded to form for the first time a solid base for more effective activity in this most essential field.
I want to congratulate and express my appreciation to Senator Fulbright, whose name has long been a household symbol in the world for this great phase of our national and international life, and to Congressman Wayne Hays who has so skillfully and conscientiously steered this legislation through the House.
Note: The Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 is Public Law 87-256 (75 Stat. 527).
