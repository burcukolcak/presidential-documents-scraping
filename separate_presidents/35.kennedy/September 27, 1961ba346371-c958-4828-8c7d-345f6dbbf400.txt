Letters to the Vice President Relating to His Trip to Sweden To Attend the Funeral of Dag Hammarskjold.
[Released September 27, 1961. Dated September 26, 1961]
Dear Lyndon:
I am very grateful to you for undertaking to serve as my representative at the funeral of Dag Hammarskjold. I would have liked to make this journey myself, and I am most grateful that you will act as the senior representative for the United States in my place. I am sure you will convey to the Hammarskjold family and to the appropriate officials of the Swedish government my own profound sympathy and respect of the American government and the American people.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
Dear Lyndon:
I know that your trip to Sweden will perhaps be brief and that you might find it necessary to come back immediately after the Hammarskjold funeral because of previous engagements, but if circumstances make it possible I shall be glad if you can find time for a brief stop in Paris on your way back. There is much going on in our discussions with our major European allies and I shall be glad to have the advantage of your own account of discussions which you might have in Paris with our senior people there--men like Gavin, Finletter and General Norstad, if he has not already left to come back here for direct discussions in Washington.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
Note: In the second letter the President referred to the American Ambassador to France, James M. Gavin; the U.S. Permanent Representative on the Council of NATO, Thomas K. Finletter; and the Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe, General Lauris Notstad.
The letters were released at Newport, R.I.
