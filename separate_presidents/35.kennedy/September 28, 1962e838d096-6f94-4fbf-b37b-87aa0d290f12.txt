Remarks Upon Signing Bill Providing for the Padre Island National Seashore.
Ladies and gentlemen:
I am pleased to approve S. 4, providing for the establishment of the Padre Island National Seashore.
The 113-mile-long Padre Island along the Texas coast of the Gulf of Mexico, extending from Corpus Christi on the north almost to Mexico on the south, is the longest barrier island of the United States. By preserving 80 miles of the island's scenic, untrammeled shoreland, this measure will make possible a broad range of year-round opportunities for recreation and quiet enjoyment of a natural environment for a large number of people.
The Padre Island National Seashore is the third authorized by the 87th Congress insuring that this Congress will enjoy an honored position in the development of conservation in this country. Padre Island on the Gulf will now take its place with Cape Cod on the Atlantic, and Point Reyes on the Pacific. Each of these areas has its unique characteristics--each is readily accessible to millions of Americans--each will offer an enduring opportunity for the renewal of body and spirit where the land meets the sea.
I want to congratulate the Members of the Congress. As I said, these are three very exceptional sites which have been preserved for the people of the United States. The one at Cape Cod which I know intimately was a great step forward as was the one at San Francisco, and now we will have this one off the coast of Texas. I think the Members of Congress can look upon this step forward with unprecedented pride for many, many years.
Note: The President spoke at 12:30 p.m. in his office at the White House. As enacted, S. 4 is Public Law 87-712 (70 Stat. 650).
