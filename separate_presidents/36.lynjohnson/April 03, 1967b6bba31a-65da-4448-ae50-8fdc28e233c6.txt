Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of National Capital Transportation Agency.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit the second annual report of the National Capital Transportation Agency for calendar year 1966.
Significant steps were taken during 1966 by the Congress, the Executive Branch, and the State and local governments of the National Capital Region toward solving the transportation problems of the Washington Metropolitan Area.
During the year evidence of progress first became visible to Washington commuters. Survey markers and boring equipment on streets and sidewalks show that we are finally beginning to move.
In October, the Congress approved the interstate compact between Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia creating the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. That Authority will assume responsibility for the Washington rapid transit system and plan its extension into the Maryland and Virginia suburbs. At year's end, with the assistance of the experienced staff of the Transportation Agency, the new Authority had already embarked upon the preparation of a regional mass transit plan.
Progress has been made. We have the authority to attack the severe traffic problems plaguing the Nation's Capital and its suburbs. Now we must, and will, make every effort to implement that authority--wisely, rapidly and efficiently.
