Excerpts of Remarks to a Group of Foreign Editors on a Statement by the Government of North Vietnam.
I AM GOING to a meeting at lunch. I am a little late .... I am going to review the Hanoi statement this morning that indicated that there might be some movement.
The other night we looked long and hard. We had consulted lots of governments and a great many experts. We tried to take one positive step that could lead to peace and if it were recognized by the offer side, it could lead to another positive step and another one until maybe we could find some way to end this terrible war ....

So, we are now trying to study the [Hanoi] statement and we will make a comment on it. We are very interested in it and if it says what some people think it says, it is something that we are very interested in ....
Note: The editors were at the White House for a tour, movie, and reception prior to accompanying Mrs. Johnson on a Discover America tour of Texas beginning April 5. The President came into the White House Theater as they were viewing the movie, "The President's Country," and spoke briefly with them.
