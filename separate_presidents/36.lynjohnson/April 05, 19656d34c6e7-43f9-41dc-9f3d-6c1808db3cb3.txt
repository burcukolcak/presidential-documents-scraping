Letter Requesting a Study of the Effect of Imports of Watch Movements.
[ Released April 5, 1965. Dated April 2, 1965 ]

Dear Governor Ellington:
I should appreciate your initiating an investigation, in accordance with Section 232 (b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, to determine the effects on the national security of imports of watch movements. A long period has elapsed since the last full investigation of this matter, which led to the issuance of a report in early 1958 by the Office of Defense Mobilization, and it would seem useful to have an up-to-date assessment of the situation.
I hope that the experience which OEP's predecessor agency, along with the Departments of Defense, Commerce, and Labor, gained in the earlier investigation would mean that a new review, involving these and other agencies, could be concluded within the next six months.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mr. Buford Ellington, Director, Office of Emergency Manning, Washington, D.C., 20504]
