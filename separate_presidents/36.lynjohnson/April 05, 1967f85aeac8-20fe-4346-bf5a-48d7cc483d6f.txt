Statement by the President Upon Announcing Allocation of Funds" for Educational Opportunity Grants to College Students.
THE INVESTMENT which makes a college education possible for these young people is a deeply satisfying one. This investment will be returned many times over when they take their places as highly trained and contributing members of our society.
Students helped by grants last year have varied backgrounds, talents and aspirations; they come from all sections of the country.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House release announcing that 217,000 students, otherwise unable to attend college, would receive Federal grants for the 1967-1968 academic year. The release stated that $108 million would be distributed to 1,518 colleges and universities under a program administered by the Office of Education and authorized by the Higher Education Act of 1965.
To be eligible for grants, the release noted, "beginning full-time students must be in extreme financial need and must have been accepted by a college participating in the program."
Examples of students assisted by the program during its first year of operation are included in the release (see Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents, vol. 3, p. 595).
