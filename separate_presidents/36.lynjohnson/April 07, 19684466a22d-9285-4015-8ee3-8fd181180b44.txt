Telegram to the Governor of Maryland in Response to His Request for Federal Troops in Baltimore.
IN RESPONSE to your official request that federal troops be sent to assist local and state police and the Maryland National Guardsmen under your command and on your representation that "under existing circumstances, the law enforcement resources of the state are unable to suppress the serious domestic violence in or near the city of Baltimore, State of Maryland," I have already directed the troops you requested to proceed at once to Druid Hill Park, Baltimore. They will be available on arrival for immediate deployment as required to support and assist police and the Maryland National Guard forces.
