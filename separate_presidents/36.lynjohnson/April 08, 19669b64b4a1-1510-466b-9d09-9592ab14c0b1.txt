Letter to Archbishop Lucey Presenting Him With a Memory Book Recording the Occasion of His 50th Anniversary Luncheon.
Your Excellency:
Four weeks ago, business and civic leaders of San Antonio honored you at a luncheon observing your fiftieth year as a priest, and your twenty-fifth year as Archbishop of San Antonio.
It was with great regret that I was unable to attend and participate in so memorable an occasion.
However, I am pleased to find that I will have a part in this event, after all.
On behalf of the Luncheon Committee, it is my great pleasure to present to you this bound volume . . . a memory book of the luncheon. It is signed by all who attended.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON

[The Most Reverend Robert E. Lucey, Archbishop of San Antonio, 2826 Old Moss Street, San Antonio, Texas]
