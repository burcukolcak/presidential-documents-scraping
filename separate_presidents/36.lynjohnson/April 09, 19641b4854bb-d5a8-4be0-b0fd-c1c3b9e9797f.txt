Lyndon B. Johnson
April 09, 1964

Statement by the President on the Eve of a National Railroad Strike.
THE extremely serious consequences of a nationwide shutdown of the railroads are plain and clear.
The interests of the parties and of the public require that every practical effort be made to avoid these consequences.
Although this railroad controversy has gone on for over 4 years, it has now been brought to a crisis stage with less than 48 hours available for last ditch collective bargaining.
This does not give the bargaining process a fair chance.
It does not give the country a fair break.
I therefore request the parties to restore the status quo as it existed 2 days ago and to maintain this status quo for 20 days.
During this period, the Secretary of Labor and the Chairman of the National Mediation Board will work intensively and continuously with the parties to achieve a settlement of the remaining issues in dispute or to obtain agreement on procedures assuring their ultimate settlement.
I will expect to keep in close touch personally with this situation.
I ask that the parties advise me by 8 o'clock tonight of their acceptance of this request, which is made in the interest of the Nation.
Note: Later in the evening the President announced on a nationwide radio and television broadcast a truce in the railroad labor dispute (see Item 252).
