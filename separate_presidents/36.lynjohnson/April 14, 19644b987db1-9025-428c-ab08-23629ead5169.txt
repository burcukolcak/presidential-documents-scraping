Memorandum in Response to a Progress Report on the Joint financial Management Improvement Program.
Memorandum for the Comptroller General of the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the Bureau of the Budget:
I am pleased with the impressive results disclosed in your report of progress made under the Joint financial Management Improvement Program since its inception in 1948â€¢
This drive to modernize and improve federal financial management was begun under President Truman. It has had the strong support of succeeding Presidents of both parties.
It will continue to have my strong support.
Savings in personnel and other costs of financial management have been tangible and significant.
Of equal importance is the fact that both the Executive and the Congress now have at their fingertips more and better cost information than at any time in the past. This is invaluable in our efforts to reduce overall costs and manage our financial resources in a responsible manner.
I commend each of the principal financial management agencies for their diligence, as well as the departments and agencies which have responded so well to the objectives of this program.
The task is not finished.
I will expect to see further progress.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
