Remarks following a Meeting With Railroad Management and Union Representatives.
I HAVE met again today with the railroad management and union representatives and the distinguished group of mediators. There is no settlement yet and there can be no settlement until all the issues are disposed of. Both sides are trying their dead level best to reach an agreement. I am convinced of that. They have narrowed the area of difference on some issues already.
The principal question is whether these bargainers can, in 15 days, get over 4 years of the idea of somebody else settling their disagreements for them. I hope they can. I think they can. Intensive mediation will continue and I have asked for a definitive report to me by this weekend. We should know definitely, not later than next Monday, whether the parties to this dispute will settle it by the process of bargaining and by responsible reason. The country expects that answer to be yes.
Note: The President spoke in the Cabinet Room at the White House.
