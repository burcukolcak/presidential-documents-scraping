Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Relieving Certain Explorer Scouts From Duties on Imported Band Uniforms.
I HAVE TODAY signed H.R. 8647, for the relief of the Troubadors Drum and Bugle Corps of Bridgeport, Conn.
The bill relieves a group of underprivileged Explorer Scouts from customs duties on band uniforms imported from Mexico. The duties imposed were substantially beyond their means or expectations.
I recognize the worthy motives that inspired the passage of H.R. 8647, and I shall not deny relief to these young men after Congress has unanimously approved a measure in their behalf.

Nevertheless, in fairness to others who import goods from abroad, relief of this kind should be sparingly accorded. I do not regard approval of the measure as establishing a favorable precedent for Presidential action on similar bills in the future.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 8647 is Private Law 89-241 (80 Stat. 1625).
The statement was released at San Antonio, Texas.
