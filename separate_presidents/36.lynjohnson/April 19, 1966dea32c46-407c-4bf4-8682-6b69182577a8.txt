Statement by the President on the First Privately Owned Facility for Reprocessing Fuel From Nuclear Powerplants.
CHAIRMAN SEABORG of the Atomic Energy Commission has advised me that the Nation's first privately owned plant for reprocessing of fuel from nuclear powerplants soon will be in operation in Cattaraugus County, New York.
This plant, owned by the Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc., is a noteworthy step in the development of a strong, self-supporting nuclear industry in the United States. It will provide facilities to process spent radioactive fuels discharged from nuclear powerplants to recover the unburned fuel and other valuable material. The construction of this plant with private capital has reduced Government capital expenditures which might have been otherwise necessary. This represents a major step toward placing this important atomic energy operation in the private sector of our economy. It is a splendid example of Government-industry cooperation to bring the benefits of the peaceful atom to our country. It is another instance where the U.S. Government is following the sound policy of turning over to private industry a service for which industry has shown a competence and willingness to perform.
