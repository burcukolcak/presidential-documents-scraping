Statement by the President on the Death of Konrad Adenauer.
AMERICANS mourn the passing of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. To us, to Europe, and to the world, he will always be a symbol of the vitality and courage of the German people. We will never forget his lifelong opposition to tyranny in any form. Nor will we forget how, with single-minded determination, he led his nation from the ruins of war to a prosperous and respected position in the family of free nations.
Konrad Adenauer will be missed everywhere, but his dauntless spirit will live on in the Atlantic partnership he did so much to create. The contribution he made is one from which all free men will profit. There can be no greater monument to the memory of a great and beloved man.
Note: On April 23, George E. Christian, Special Assistant to the President, announced that the President would go to Germany to attend the funeral of Chancellor Adenauer and that he would call on President Heinrich Luebke and Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger (3 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs., P. 659).
