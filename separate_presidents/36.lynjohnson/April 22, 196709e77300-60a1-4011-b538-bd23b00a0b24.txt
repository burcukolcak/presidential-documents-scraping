Statement by the President on Offering Assistance Following Tornadoes in the Midwest.
THE TORNADOES in the Midwest have left in their wake a tragic toll in human lives, suffering, and property damage.
I have asked Farris Bryant, the Director of the Office of Emergency Planning, and other agencies of the Federal Government to render all possible assistance to Governor Kerner and the local authorities so that the resources of the Federal Government can quickly respond to the needs of the people in their time of crisis. I today have also directed Governor Bryant to dispatch immediately emergency teams to the areas hardest hit to provide on-the-scene assistance.
Although I depart for Germany tomorrow, I have asked that I be kept fully informed of the efforts that are being made to help ease the burdens which this natural disaster has wrought.
Note: In his statement the President referred to Governor Otto Kerner of Illinois.
