Telegram to the Governors Inviting Them to a Luncheon Honoring General Westmoreland.
[ Released April 24, 1967. Dated April 22, 1967 ]
I REALIZE that you were in Washington only a short time ago, but I do hope you can be with us at lunch honoring General Westmoreland on Friday, April 28 at the White House at one o'clock. I am asking the Secretaries of State and Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and members of the Armed Services, Appropriations and Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations Committees of the Congress.
We will hear General Westmoreland and have an exchange of views. We would of course warmly welcome you but if you can't come, we will thoroughly understand in the light of your own important problems in the State. RSVP Social Secretary, The White House.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
Note: For the President's remarks at the luncheon for General Westmoreland, see Item 195.
