Message to President Podgorny on the Death of Soviet Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov.
THE DEATH of Vladimir Komarov is a tragedy in which all nations share. Like three American astronauts who lost their lives recently, this distinguished space pioneer died in the cause of science and in the eternal spirit of human adventure.
I extend the sympathy of the American people to his family and to the people of the Soviet Union.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[His Excellency Nikolai Viktorovich Podgorny, Chairman, Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, U.S.S.R.]
Note: The President's message was made public at Bonn, Germany.
According to press reports, Col. Vladimir Komaroy, completing a e-day orbital flight, was killed when his Soyuz I spacecraft became tangled in its parachute cords after reentering the earth's atmosphere.
