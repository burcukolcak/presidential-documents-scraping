Lyndon B. Johnson
April 24, 1968

Statement by the President on the Administrative Conference of the United States.
I AM DELIGHTED that the Administrative Conference is now fully organized and will hold its first plenary session next month. It is heartening that so many eminent private citizens will contribute their time and talent to this important endeavor. Through this Conference major improvements will be achieved in the processes of Government that vitally affect our citizens every day.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House release announcing the executive departments and independent agencies designated by the President for membership in the Administrative Conference of the United States.
The release stated that the Conference is the "new permanent forum established by Congress through which the Government agencies will work with representatives of the public to improve the processes by which they administer programs affecting private rights and interests." The release listed the 32 public members of the Administrative Conference as well as the 10 members of the Council of the Conference appointed by the President on February 7, 1968. The full text is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 4, p. 703).
