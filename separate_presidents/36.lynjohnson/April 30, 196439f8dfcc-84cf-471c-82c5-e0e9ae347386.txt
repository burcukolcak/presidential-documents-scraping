Whereasthe United Nations has earned, and is entitled to receive an affirmative expression of, the respect and recognition of this Nation, and of each of its other members, for its inestimable contributions to international peace, justice, and understanding; and
Whereasit is essential that the United Nations be supported, both morally and materially, by us and by all of its other members; and

In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
