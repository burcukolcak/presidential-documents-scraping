Message to President Trejos Concerning the Dispatch of Scientists To Study Volcanic Eruptions in Costa Rica.
Mr. President:
Charge Pringle has informed me of your interest in having experts from the Smithsonian Institution study the pattern of eruption cycles of the volcano Arenal.
I am dispatching a team of distinguished scientists from the Smithsonian Institution and the United States Geological Survey to assist your local scientists in evaluating the effects of the volcanic eruptions.
The first member of this joint team, Dr. Thomas E. Simkin, arrives today. The other members of the team, Dr. Howard H. Waldron and Dr. William G. Melson, plan to be in San Jose shortly.
I regret to hear that the volcano continues to erupt, adding to the suffering and losses already sustained. You and the people of Costa Rica have my sympathy in this hour of national emergency.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable Jose Joaquin Trejos Fernandez, President of Costa Pica]
Note: In his message the President referred to Sandy MacGregor Pringle, Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S.. Embassy in Costa Rica.
