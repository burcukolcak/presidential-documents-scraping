Letter to the Secretary of State on Social Science Research in Foreign Areas.
[Released August 4, 1965. Dated August 2, 1965] Dear Mr. Secretary:
Many agencies of the Government are sponsoring social science research which focuses on foreign areas and people and thus relates to the foreign policy of the United States. Some of it involves residence and travel in foreign countries and communication with foreign nationals. As we have recently learned, it can raise problems affecting the conduct of our foreign policy.
For that reason I am determined that no Government sponsorship of foreign area research should be undertaken which in the judgment of the Secretary of State would adversely affect United States foreign relations. Therefore I am asking you to establish effective procedures which will enable you to assure the propriety of Government sponsored social science research in the area of foreign policy. I suggest that you consult with the Director of the Bureau of the Budget to determine the proper procedures for the clearance of foreign affairs research projects on a Government-wide basis.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable Dean Rusk, Secretary of State, Washington, D.C. 20520]
