Statement by the President on the Passage of the Joint Resolution on Southeast Asia.
THE 414-to-nothing House vote and the 88-to-2 Senate vote on the passage of the Joint Resolution on Southeast Asia is a demonstration to all the world of the unity of all Americans. They prove our determination to defend our own forces, to prevent aggression, and to work firmly and steadily for peace and security in the area.
I am sure the American people join me in expressing the deepest appreciation to the leaders and Members of both parties, in both Houses of Congress, for their patriotic, resolute, and rapid action.
Note: This statement was read by the Press Secretary to the President, George E. Reedy, at his news conference held at the White House at 1:40 p.m. on August 7, 1964.
