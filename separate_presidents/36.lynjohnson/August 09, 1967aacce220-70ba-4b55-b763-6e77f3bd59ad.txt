Lyndon B. Johnson
August 09, 1967

Statement by the President Following Action in the House of Representatives on the Reorganization Plan for the District of Columbia.
TODAY, after 93 years, the House of Representatives has voted to replace the rusted gears of government in the Nation's Capital with an efficient city management.
It has said "yes" to good District Government-to responsive District Government.
In supporting this reorganization plan, the House has brought good news to every American--for the Nation's Capital belongs to all of us.
I have begun an intensive search for a good executive to fill the new post of District Commissioner. High on the new Commissioner's agenda will be the task of stemming the District's spiralling crime rate.
With modern government and the best executive talent, the Nation's Capital can move forward into a new era of progress.
As President, and as a resident of the District for the past 36 years, I am proud of this moment and grateful for the action taken by the House of Representatives for the benefit of the citizens of the District and our country.
Note: The President transmitted Reorganization Plan 3 of 1967 relating to the government of the District of Columbia on June 1 (see Item 247).
