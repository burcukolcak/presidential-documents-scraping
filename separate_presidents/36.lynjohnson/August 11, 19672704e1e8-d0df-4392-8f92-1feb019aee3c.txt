Remarks to the Press Following a Meeting With the U.S. Representative to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee in Geneva
I JUST HAD a very extended, interesting, and, I think, very satisfactory and hopeful meeting with Ambassador Foster. As you know, he is one of our most devoted public servants. For many years he has served his country with great credit. He is returning to Geneva tomorrow.
We look forward to the conclusion of a very long exercise of wisdom, patience, and dedication upon Mr. Foster's part.

Thank you.
Note: The President spoke at 12 noon in the Fish Room at the White House.
