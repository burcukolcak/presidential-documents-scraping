Message to the President of Korea on Learning of Plans To Dispatch Korean Troops to South Viet-Nam.
I WAS deeply gratified to learn that the National Assembly of Korea, at your request, has approved the dispatch of a Korean division to join the Korean troops already assisting the Vietnamese people in their fight to preserve the freedom of the Republic of South Viet-Nam.
The American people welcome this further demonstration of the devotion of Korea to the spirit of liberty and independence.
I know how much this contribution owes to your leadership and I want to express to you my personal gratitude.
