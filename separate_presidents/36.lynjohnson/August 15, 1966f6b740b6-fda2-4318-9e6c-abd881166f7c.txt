Memorandum to the Vice President in Response to His Report on the Summer Youth Opportunity Campaign
I WAS PLEASED and gratified to receive today your report on the Summer Youth Opportunity Campaign.
All Americans have reason for satisfaction that, for the second straight year, more than 1 million young Americans have been at work who otherwise would have been without summer jobs. I think we have particular reason for satisfaction that all but 50,000 of the 1,048,554 jobs were provided by the private sector.
The jobs provided to these young people will give them a far better chance of continuing their education and becoming productive citizens--and far less chance of falling victim to delinquency and unemployment--than if they had been left in the streets during these summer months.
We are determined that the economic and social conditions which threaten the futures of our young people shall be overcome. But out efforts to defeat poverty, crowding, discrimination, and crime will not be completed tomorrow.
I am asking the Youth Opportunity Task Force, in cooperation with the Youth Opportunity Advisory Committee, to evaluate the program this summer and to look at the possibility of a continuing all-year youth opportunity program which can form the nucleus for an expanded summer job program next year.
In light of the estimated 900,000 young Americans who are expected to turn their backs on school during the coming year, I direct you to undertake again in 1966 a Stay-in-School Campaign so that our country will not suffer this terrible loss in its human resources.
At the same time I hope that all levels of government, as well as our private industry, agriculture, and labor, will be able to play an increasing and coordinated role in these programs so that the young people who most need skills and education will have their chance to receive them.
Note: The Vice President's report, in the form of a memorandum to the President, was also made public by the White House on August 15.
The Youth Opportunity Task Force was established by the President's memorandum of March 5, 1966 (Item 105 above). For the appointment of the Youth Opportunity Advisory Committee see the President's statement of April 11 (Item 172 above). The Vice President's memorandum highlighted the following accomplishments of the youth campaign:
"I. - Youth Opportunity Campaign
"On April 11, you announced the beginning of your 1966 Youth Opportunity Campaign to provide one million extra summer jobs for our 16-21 year olds.
"I am pleased to report that the goal you set for us has been exceeded--reports received directly from employers, and from State Employment offices around the country, extra Federal hiring and Neighborhood Youth Corps allocations have yielded a total of 1,048,554 extra jobs for youth.
"The Labor Department's employment-unemployment reports confirm that success. 16-21 year old unemployment dropped from 12.3 in July 1965 to 10.7 in July 1966. Employment of 16-21 year olds in July 1966 exceeded July 1965 by 900,000.
"II. - Recreation and Remedial Programs
"I. Operation Champ--A total of 1 million dollars was funded for this program in 10 cities (each city received approximately $100,000). Over 250,000 youths will be served in this program. The Department of Labor also provided each city with 250 Neighborhood Youth Corps workers as well as junior and senior counsellors.
"The program is being focused on deprived areas of the 10 cities (New York, Detroit, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Houston, San Antonio, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Boston, Baltimore). National sports figures have been participating fully in all aspects of Operation Champ (e.g., Rocky Marciano, Wilma Rudolph, Eddie Le Baron, Ollie Matson, Donna de Varona).
"2. Headstart--Some $27.2 million was allocated for the summer Headstart programs. 200,000 preschool children were enrolled in the special summer program. The total Headstart program for the year will involve 573,000 children.
"3. Summer Recreational and Remedial Programs--A total of $19.8 million was approved for the OEO summer recreational and remedial and educational programs. It is estimated that between 500,000 and 1 million people will be served by these various programs.
"4. Neighborhood Youth Corps--Jobs for 85,700 youths in the NYC special summer program are expected to be filled in the 34 cities and the Cumberland Area. The total cost of the program is approximately $34 million.
"5. Elementary and Secondary Education Act (Title I)--A total of about $44 million has been allocated to the 34 cities for various educational projects during the summer. It is estimated that 300,000-500,000 youths and adults will be served by these projects.
"III. - Back-To-School Drive
"I would recommend that you again launch a Youth Opportunity Back-to-School drive to reaffirm the need for as much education as possible and to caution against taking today's job in preference to preparation for tomorrow."
