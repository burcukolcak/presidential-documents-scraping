Statement by the President Upon Sending Copies of the Moon Photographs to Leaders of 110 Nations.
IN THE NAME of the people of the United States, as an expression of their desire that human knowledge be used for human betterment, I am sending to the leaders of 110 nations a set of photographs of the moon taken by the cameras of the Ranger VII on its historic mission of July 31, 1964. Each set includes five photographs taken at distances from the lunar surface varying from 480 miles down to 100 feet.
The success of the Ranger VII exploration has been greeted with enthusiasm and interest around the world. Men of all nations recognize this is one of the greatest extensions of human knowledge about the lunar surface to occur in many centuries.
The American people can be justly proud. We started behind in the space age. But we placed our trust in our open society and free system. Our achievements in peaceful exploration of space give us all cause to be proud, grateful, and confident.
Since the beginning of our space effort, the United States has invited and urged all nations to make this vital new exploration a joint venture of international cooperation. More than 60 countries now work together voluntarily in this pursuit. We continue to hope that the extent of such international cooperation will be enlarged and that all nations will join through the United Nations to place the peaceful realms of space off-limits to the designs of aggressors on earth.
The responsibility placed upon us by our role is great and continuing. I am sure the American people will continue to support what is necessary to assure leadership. In return they will rightfully expect that our program hold to the orderly and responsible course which has brought such outstanding success in such a short period.
