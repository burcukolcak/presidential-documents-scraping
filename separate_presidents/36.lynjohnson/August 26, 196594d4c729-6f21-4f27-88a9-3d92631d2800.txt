Lyndon B. Johnson
August 26, 1965

Statement by the President Following House Passage of the Higher Education Bill.
THIS is a great night for higher education in America. The House of Representatives has added a major building block to our college system by passing the Higher Education Act of 1965. More than a million students can benefit in the next year by guaranteed low interest loans--a program I have urged for the past 15 years. More than a quarter million needy students can get part-time jobs to help them continue their college studies. More than one hundred thousand students of exceptional promise and great financial need can receive opportunity grants.
The bill passed by the House also strengthens our colleges by providing books and trained personnel to enrich college libraries and funds to assist our less developed institutions of learning.
Finally, the House has challenged our universities to face the problems of the city through community service programs.
This bill not only strengthens higher education; it adds to the mental might of the Nation.
Note: The Higher Education Act of 1965 was approved by the President on November 8, 1965 (see Item 603).
