Lyndon B. Johnson
August 28, 1967

Statement by the President Following Senate Committee Action on the Model Cities and Rent Supplement Programs.
TODAY, the Senate Appropriations Committee reaffirmed our pledge to bring new hope and progress to the Nation's cities.
The Committee voted the full $40 million I requested for rent supplements.

It voted $537 million out of the $662 million I requested for the model cities program--including the full $400 million we sought for model cities supplementary grants.
It voted $15 million of the $20 million we requested to advance urban research and technology.
Although these amounts fall somewhat short of my request, they will go far towards solving the critical problems of our cities.
All Americans owe their thanks to Senator Magnuson and to the able and progressive members of the Senate Committee.
I hope the Congress will follow the course set by these leaders and approve full funding for the model cities and rent supplement programs.
If ever there were a time for action, the time is now. I call upon the Congress for speedy consideration and passage of the $7 billion in vitally needed city programs--the most comprehensive program for urban America presented to a Congress of the United States. These laws will benefit every city dweller and enrich the lives of all Americans.
Note: In his statement the President referred to Senator Warren G. Magnuson of Washington, member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Funds for the programs were provided by the Independent Offices and Department of Housing and Urban Development Appropriation Act, 1968. For the President's statement upon signing the measure, see Item 467.
