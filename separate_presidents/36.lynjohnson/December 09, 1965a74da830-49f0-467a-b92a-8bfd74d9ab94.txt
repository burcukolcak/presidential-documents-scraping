Telephone Remarks Upon Accepting an Award From the Salvation Army Association of New York
Mr. Buckner and my good friend, Fred Kappel, ladies and gentlemen:
I feel a very special gratitude in receiving this honor today--because I think I know something of the men and women who extend it. Your standard of service is high, your record of accomplishment proud and long.
For a century now, the Salvation Army has offered food to the hungry and shelter to the homeless--in clinics and children's homes, through disaster relief, in prison and welfare work, and a thousand other endeavors. In that century you have proved time and again the power of a handshake, a meal, and a song.
But you have not stopped there. You have demonstrated also the power of a great idea. The voice of the Salvation Army has reminded men that physical well-being is just not enough; that spiritual rebirth is the most pressing need of our time and of every time; that the world cannot be changed unless men change.
That voice has been clear and courageous-and it has been heard.
Even when other armies have disbanded, I hope that this one will still be on the firing line: an army whose foes are hunger and hopelessness; an army whose happy battle cry is a call to "brighten the corner where you are."
With a pledge to heed that good advice, and with genuinely warm appreciation, I proudly accept your award.
Note: The President spoke at 1 p.m. by telephone from the LBJ Ranch, Johnson City, Tex., to a meeting of the Salvation Army Association at the New York Hilton Hotel. In his opening words he referred to Walker G. Buckner, Chairman of the Salvation Army Advisory Board, and Frederick R. Kappel, Chairman of the Board, American Telephone and Telegraph Company, and member of the Salvation Army Advisory Board.
