Special Message to the Congress on the Coinage of John F. Kennedy 50-Cent Pieces.
To the Congress of the United States:
I hereby submit to the Congress a draft of a proposed bill which would provide for the coinage of 50-cent pieces with the likeness of the late John Fitzgerald Kennedy. With the adoption of this proposal each of the five denominations now being produced by the Mint, i.e., one-cent through fifty-cent pieces, would have the likeness of a President on the obverse of the coin.
The consent of the Congress is required to make this change in view of the provisions of section 3510 of the Revised Statutes, as amended (31 U.S.C. 276), which provides that no change in the design of a coin shall be made oftener than once in twenty-five years. The present design was adopted in 1948.
If the legislation is enacted, the Treasury Department plans to use the likeness of the late President Kennedy which is being used on a "Presidential series" medal now being manufactured and sold at the Philadelphia Mint. The design of this medal was approved personally by the late President. Mint artists would prepare an appropriate reverse for the coin.
I strongly recommend the enactment of this proposed legislation at the earliest possible date in order that the likeness of President Kennedy will appear on the 50-cent coins issued at the beginning of the calendar year 1964.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
Note: On December 30, 1963, the President approved an act providing for the coinage of the 500 cent pieces (Public Law 88-256, 77 Stat. 843).
