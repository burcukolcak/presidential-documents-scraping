Statement by the President on the Death of Senator E. L. Bartlett of Alaska.
WITH THE DEATH of Senator Bob Bartlett, America has lost one of its last authentic pioneers, Alaska has lost a founding father, and I have lost a friend.
Senator Bartlett had a rich and varied career. He had been a construction worker, a reporter, a gold miner, and a public servant. But more than anything else, he will be remembered as the man who believed in Alaska's potential and devoted his life to that cause.
He will be sadly missed, but affectionately remembered by the many men and women whose lives he helped to enrich.
Note: Senator E. L. (Bob) Bartlett served as Delegate to Congress from Alaska from 1945 to 1959 and as Senator from 1959 until his death.
