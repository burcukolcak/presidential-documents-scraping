Statement by the President on the Forthcoming Retirement of Prime Minister Lester Pearson of Canada.
PRIME MINISTER Pearson has served his country and the world for 40 years with distinction-as diplomat, party leader, and Prime Minister. We shall remain in close contact with the Prime Minister in the weeks ahead. We believe that the cordial relations which our two countries have so long enjoyed will continue beyond his retirement.
