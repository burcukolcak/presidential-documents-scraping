Letter Accepting Resignation of Luther H. Hodges as Secretary of Commerce.
Dear Luther:
I am personally reluctant to accept your resignation. Your achievements as Secretary of Commerce have been a continuation of the selfless, patriotic dedication you have exhibited throughout your long service to your State and your Nation.
Your leadership in the Commerce Department has been marked by prudence and progress. You have given of your wisdom and your tolerance not only to your own Department, but to the entire Cabinet as well.
Under your leadership, our country has entered into a new era of international trade, increased cooperation between government and industry, and technological advancement for the industrial and commercial segments of our national life.
Good and wise men, sympathetic to the needs of the people, ready to work around the clock to meet those needs--these men are rare and precious. You are one of that scarce breed. You leave this government with my affection and my warmest best wishes.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
