TO THE

21ST TACTICAL AIR SUPPORT SQUADRON
The 21st Tactical Air Support Squadron, pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary gallantry in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force in Southeast Asia, from 2 February 1966 to 28 February 1967. During this period, the exemplary courage, superb airmanship and dedication to mission accomplishment displayed by the members of the 21st Tactical Air Support Squadron contributed significantly to the success of major military operations, containment or defeat of the enemy, and the saving of countless American and allied lives. The personnel of this Squadron have consistently accomplished their missions by flying their unarmed aircraft at low altitudes and through extremely hostile fire to direct friendly air strikes and provide cover for tactical, resupply, and medical evacuation operations. The extraordinary heroism displayed by this Squadron in carrying out its mission has been unique and noteworthy. By their gallantry and untiring devotion to duty, the personnel of the 21st Tactical Air Support Squadron have reflected the highest credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.
