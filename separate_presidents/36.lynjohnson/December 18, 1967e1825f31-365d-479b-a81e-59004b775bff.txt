Telegram on the Occasion of the Silver Bridge Tragedy, West Virginia-Ohio.
THE NATION has been saddened by the Silver Bridge tragedy and I express deepest sympathy to you and through you to the stricken families and the people of West Virginia and Ohio. As you know, immediately upon learning of this disaster all appropriate Federal agencies were called upon to render rescue and recovery assistance coordinated by the Office of Emergency Planning. They have been at the scene with you and will continue as long as needed. Also, in addition to conducting an investigation of the causes, we are rushing plans to help you restore transportation across the river and help rebuild the bridge. Every possible help will continue to be rendered.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
