Statement by the President Upon Signing Order Providing for the Manner of Election of the Chief Executive, Ryukyu Islands.
I HAVE today signed an amendment to Executive Order 10713, as previously amended, which provides for the administration of Okinawa and other Ryukyu Islands. The new amendment specifies that the Ryukyuan Chief Executive, heretofore appointed by the U.S. High Commissioner, shall henceforth be elected by the legislative body of the Government of the Ryukyu Islands, as the popularly chosen representatives of the Ryukyuan people.
This amendment is another forward step in the continuing policy of the United States to afford the Ryukyuan people as great a voice in managing their own affairs as is compatible with the essential role of the Ryukyus in maintaining the security of Japan and the Far East.
I am happy to announce this change at this time, so as to insure that the Ryukyuan Chief Executive for the next term can be elected directly by the representatives of the Ryukyuan people.
Note: The President referred to Executive Order 11263 "Further Amending Executive Order No. 10713, Providing for Administration of the Ryukyu Islands" (I Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs., p. 608; 30 F.R. 15777; 3 CFR, 1965 Supp., p. 195); and to Executive Order 107133 "Providing for Administration of the Ryukyu Islands," dated June 5, 1957 (3 CFR, 1954-1958 Comp., p. 368).
