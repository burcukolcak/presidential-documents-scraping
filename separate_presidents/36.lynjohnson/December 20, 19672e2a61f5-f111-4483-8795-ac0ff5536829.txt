Statement by the President Upon Establishing a Task Force To Conduct a National Survey of Bridge Safety.
[Released December 20, 1967. Dated December 19, 1967]
THE COLLAPSE of the Ohio River bridge on highway U.S. 35 connecting Gallipolis, Ohio, and Point Pleasant, W. Va., has brought tragedy to many American families. We are all shocked by this cruel tragedy and loss of life.
We must prevent similar tragedies elsewhere in the Nation. We must assure our, selves that other bridges will be safe for our people.

All Americans have a vital interest in obtaining answers to the questions raised by the collapse of the Ohio River bridge. That bridge and many others serve as vital links in our national highway and rail system.
I am therefore establishing a task force, chaired by the Secretary of Transportation, to begin immediately an intensive study of the Ohio River bridge tragedy and to conduct a national survey of bridge safety.
The Director of the Office of Emergency Planning and the Secretary of the Army will serve with Secretary Boyd. I have directed all department and agency heads to cooperate fully with the task force.
I have asked Secretary Boyd to work closely with Governor Hulett Smith of West Virginia and Governor James Rhodes of Ohio in the study of the Ohio River bridge, and with all the Governors in the national bridge safety study.
