Remarks at the Airport in Pago Pago, American Samoa.
Governor and Mrs. Aspinall, my friends of Samoa:
We have enjoyed very much your entertainment this evening. We thank all of you for coming here and giving us this very warm greeting.
We prize very highly the friends that we have here. We recall very vividly when Mrs. Johnson and I dedicated the school you had been generous enough to name in her honor.
I remember many months ago first hearing of the great success you had made with your educational TV and how it excited the interest of many of our people in our country and in the Congress. I am glad to tell you now that we are trying to follow in your footsteps. Very shortly we will set up a public TV Of our own.
What you are doing here in the way of schools and education is something we are very proud of, as we are proud of the new hospital that you will shortly be dedicating.
Governor Aspinall referred to the contribution that your men are making in our armed services. We salute them and we thank them.
Our concern always will be with your health, with your education, and with your advancement.
We want each of you to know that we do care, that we are happy that you are making progress. We trust that the Good Lord will give us the strength and the leadership to permit us to continue to move ahead.
Thank you so much for your wonderful entertainment. I have enjoyed it. I appreciate your interest in coming here at this late hour. I thank you all very much.
Note: The President spoke at 12:30 a.m. at Tafuna International Airport in Pago Pago, American Samoa. In his opening words he referred to Owen S. Aspinall, Governor of American Samoa, and his wife.
