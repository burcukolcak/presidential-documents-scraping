Lyndon B. Johnson
December 21, 1968

Statement by the President on Making Public a Report on Programs and Goals in Health, Education, and Welfare, 1963-1968.
[THIS IS] a landmark report of landmark achievements. I can think of very few documents that I have seen during my Presidency that have given me more satisfaction than Secretary Cohen's report. The events and actions recorded here--in leadership, in legislation, and in administration--are the events and actions by which this administration will be remembered.
The momentum we have now must not be allowed to slacken. Mr. Cohen is showing the way to maintain and to quicken the pace.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House release summarizing a report by Wilbur J. Cohen, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (4 Weekly Comp. Pres Does., p. 1739). The 136-page report is entitled "Health, Education, and Welfare: Accomplishments, 1963-1968, Problems and Challenges, and, a Look to the Future; A Report to President Lyndon B. Johnson."
