Lyndon B. Johnson
December 27, 1967

Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Providing for District of Columbia Participation in the Medicaid Program.
I HAVE SIGNED H.R. 10964, a new law that deserves special notice and gives me special pride--because it brings urgently needed help to 180,000 poor and elderly citizens who live in the Nation's Capital.
Because of this new law, thousands of needy families in the District can now participate in the Nation's Medicaid program.
Because of this law, older citizens in Washington can now receive hospital benefits under Medicare for treatment in publicly-owned hospitals and health facilities.
This act is more than a promise of hope and health. It is another step toward fulfilling our pledge to make our Capital a model city--to make it truly the Nation's first city and no longer a forgotten city.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 10964 is Public Law 90-227 (81 Stat. 744).
The statement was released at San Antonio, Texas.
