Whereasthe United States Customs Service provided the principal revenues of the early Republic and assured its financial stability in its days of struggle; and
Whereasthe controls on imports and exports and on shipping and trade, deemed essential by the founders of the Republic, would have been impossible without implementation by a Customs Service, honest, resourceful, and efficient; and

Whereasafter one hundred and seventy-five years the ever more complex demands of our economy and our civilization require the Customs Service of the Treasury Department to remain alert and ready to perform on short notice a widening variety of tasks; and

I also call upon appropriate civic and industrial organizations to cooperate with the Customs Service in recognition of a century and three-quarters of mutually beneficial relationships.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 30th day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth.
