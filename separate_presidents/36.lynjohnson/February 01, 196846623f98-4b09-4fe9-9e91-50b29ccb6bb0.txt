Statement by the President Upon Signing Order Providing for Popular Election of the Chief Executive of the Ryukyu Islands.
I HAVE signed an amendment to the basic Executive order that provides for the administration of Okinawa and other Ryukyu Islands.
The amendment I have signed provides that the Ryukyuan Chief Executive--who is now elected by the legislative body of the Government of the Ryukyu Islands--shall in the future be popularly elected by the Ryukyuan people.
This is another forward step in the continuing policy of the United States to afford the Ryukyuan people a voice in managing their own affairs--as great a voice as is compatible with the Ryukyus' role in maintaining the security of Japan and the Far East. The amendment will also further the identification of Ryukyuan institutions with those of Japan proper, where prefectural chief executives are directly elected. This is consistent with the agreement reached in my recent talks with Prime Minister Sato of Japan.
General Unger, our High Commissioner in the Ryukyus, announced this change today in a speech to the Ryukyuan Legislature.
It will insure that the Ryukyuan Chief Executive for the next term can be elected directly by the Ryukyuan people.
Note: The President referred to Executive Order 11395 "Further Amending Executive Order No. 10713, Providing for Administration of the Ryukyu Islands."
