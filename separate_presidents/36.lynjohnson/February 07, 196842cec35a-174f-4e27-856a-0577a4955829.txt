Statement by the President on Appointing New Members of the National Council on the Humanities.
IT IS gratifying to know that these distinguished Americans will serve the National Endowment for the Humanities in its effort to achieve educational and public goals of great importance to all our people. In the 2 short years of its existence, the Endowment has affected many diverse groups in the country. Children from inner-city schools are participating in summer enrichment programs. Men and women are receiving encouragement to further their interest in the history of their communities and States. Grants enable scholars to discover and interpret America's past, and permit young college teachers to pursue important research. Valuable programs such as these can only be identified and supported with the thoughtful guidance of the National Council on the Humanities. These new members will, I am confident, continue the excellent work of their predecessors.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House release listing nine newly appointed members of the National Council on the Humanities, which meets quarterly as an advisory board to the National Endowment for the Humanities. The two bodies were established on September 29, 1965, by the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 (Public Law 89-209, 79 Stat. 845) in order to promote public understanding and appreciation of the humanities, and in that connection to award fellowships and grants to institutions and to support the publication of scholarly works on the humanities.
The text of the release, which lists outgoing and continuing as well as newly appointed members of the Council, is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 4, p. 252).
