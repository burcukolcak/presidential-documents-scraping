Remarks Upon Receiving the "Report to the Nation" From the Boy Scouts of America.
IT IS always a pleasure, Mr. Watson, to receive you at any time and especially so when you are engaged in such a worthwhile endeavor as the Boy Scouts. It is always a pleasure to hear about scouting. It is a fine example that a man of your stature and leadership would find time in your busy life to give leadership to such a worthwhile movement as this.
It is thrilling to have these fine examples of young manhood here. They are fine figures and we are glad to see you.
Note: The President spoke at 11:45 a.m. in his office at the White House. In his opening words he referred to Thomas J. Watson, Jr., President of the National Council, Boy Scouts of America, and Chairman of the Board of International Business Machines Corp. A group of 14 outstanding Scouts and Explorers, representing the 5,732,708 members of the Boy Scouts of America, had been selected to present to the President their annual "Report to the Nation."
