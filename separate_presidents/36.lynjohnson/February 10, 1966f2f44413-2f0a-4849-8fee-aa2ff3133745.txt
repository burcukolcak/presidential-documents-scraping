Lyndon B. Johnson
February 10, 1966

Statement by the President on the Food for Freedom Message to the Congress.
THE Food for Peace Act of 1966 charts a new course for world agriculture. It faces up to the inescapable fact that man is losing the race between the size of population and the supply of food. Before the peace of the world can be secure, this problem must be solved. For--as was said long ago--
"A hungry people listens not to reason, nor cares for justice, nor is bent by any prayers."
During the past 10 years, America has sent over 140 million tons of food to feed hungry people in other countries. We will continue that effort--but it alone is not enough. Compassion itself does not strike at the root causes of hunger. And the time is coming when even the fabulous abundance of America will not be enough to feed the world's hungry millions.
The answer is for these nations to develop their own capacity to produce the food that their people must have. They must learn to depend less on us and more on themselves. And that is the purpose of the program I have sent to Congress. The Food for Freedom program will encourage and assist those who try to help themselves. In the long run, that is the gateway to abundance.
Note: The President also recorded the statement in the Theater at the White House for radio and television broadcast.
