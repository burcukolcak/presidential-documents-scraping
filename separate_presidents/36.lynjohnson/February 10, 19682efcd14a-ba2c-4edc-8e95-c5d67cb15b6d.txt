Statement by the President Upon Signing Proclamation Marking the Anniversary of the League of United Latin American Citizens.
I HAVE long been familiar with the high purposes and good work of the League of United Latin American Citizens.
LULAC is a household word in Texas. We know it to mean a group of patriotic, devoted Americans who, for 39 years, have taken an active concern in the well-being and the future of the 10.5 million Spanish-speaking Americans.
LULAC has always recognized that education is the key that will open the doors of opportunity. In the past 5 years this administration has made long strides toward our goal of giving every American all the education he wants and is capable of. This is LULAC's goal as well.
LULAC has councils in 19 States. An important part of its program is to teach English to young Spanish-speaking Americans so they can make their full contribution to the society of which they are a part.
I know the dreams of these young Americans. In a little schoolhouse in Cotulla, Texas, I saw the hunger for learning in the eyes of children. I resolved then, as a young teacher, that I would do all in my power to satisfy their aspiration. In this effort of a lifetime, I have found LULAC at my side every step of the way.
It is therefore a special honor for me as President to proclaim the week beginning Sunday, February 11, as LULAC Week throughout the United States.
Note: The President referred to Proclamation 3827 (4 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs., p. 280; 33 F.R. 2881; 3 CFR, 1968 Comp., p. 22).
