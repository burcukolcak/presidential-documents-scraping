Statement by the President on the Study of Steel Prices by the Council of Economic Advisers.
CEA Chairman Ackley has again reported to me on the progress of his study of steel prices.
1. A questionnaire has been sent today to the eight largest steel producers, requesting relevant information not otherwise available.
2. The Council is getting full cooperation from other agencies. The Departments of Commerce and Labor are providing extensive statistical materials on historical trends in steel production, costs, prices, profits, exports, imports, employment, wages and fringe benefits, and other matters.
3. On the basis of this and other information, CEA is preparing an assessment of the significance of steel prices for the American economy.
4. The CEA staff is also preparing an analysis of the steel industry that will help to explain the major factors causing changes in productivity, costs, and profits.
As this work is completed, it will be reported in detail to me and to my other advisers.
