Remarks at a Reception for the Diplomatic Corps.
I APPRECIATE this opportunity to be with you at this lovely occasion-and to thank you for the valued contribution you are making to understanding and accord between the American people and your people.
All Americans are complimented by the quality and calibre of the diplomatic representation sent to us by each of your governments.
While I do not want to appear boastful in any narrow, nationalistic way, I believe we must have here in Washington the most outstanding diplomatic community in the world. I am quite certain, as I look over this audience, that never have so many intelligent men married so many beautiful ladies as have the diplomatic corps in Washington â€¢
All else aside, your work and ours is the most serious and most important work of history--for we are privileged to work together in the high and noble cause of peace.
The people of my country have given much to that cause at home and throughout the world--and I assure you that they are willing to give much more. Our commitment to a world of peace and justice and decency is a commitment of America's soul and heart--and we shall not turn from it, in fear or futility, in impatience or indifference.
Trials may be many--tests may come often-for all of us. But the long movement of mankind is much too clearly upward toward a better world for us to be governed by the moment when we have an eternity to win--or to lose.
The United States welcomes the privilege of working with your governments-and your people--in friendship and peace. We harbor the hope and faith that we are moving into a new and creative time in which much that has eluded man's quest before will be ours to reach together.
Note: The President spoke at 8:30 p.m. in the Benjamin Franklin Room at the Department of State at a reception for the diplomatic corps, given by Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Mrs. Rusk.
