Message to the Congress Transmitting First Annual Report of the National Capital Transportation Agency.
To the Congress of the United States:
This is the first annual report required of the National Capital Transportation Agency by section 6 of the National Capital Transportation Act of 1965 (P.L. 89-173).
1965 was marked by significant advances toward solving the transportation problems of the Washington area.
Congress approved plans for a rapid transit system, authorized its construction, and authorized grants from the Federal and District Governments as a first stage in financing its development. As soon as funds were made available, the Transportation Agency began the necessary work still remaining before actual construction can begin.
There is, nonetheless, much left to do. The rapid transit system will achieve maximum usefulness only when it is extended into Maryland and Virginia suburbs. The interstate compact among Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia will be promptly presented to Congress for its consent, in order that the interstate authority may develop plans for a full regional system and a financial plan for its construction. Arrangements must be perfected to transfer the responsibility for the system in an orderly and proper way from the Agency to the interstate authority. These tasks are not easy, and it will require diligent effort on the part of many people and agencies to master the problems that remain.
The Congress can be assured, however, that all of these problems are being given the fullest and most diligent consideration, and that none of them will be allowed to stand in the way of an uninterrupted schedule of construction.
