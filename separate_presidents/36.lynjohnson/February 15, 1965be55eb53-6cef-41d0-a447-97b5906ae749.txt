Special Message to the Congress Transmitting Report on the Communications Satellite System
To the Congress of the United States:
The past year has seen important advances in the program to develop a global communications satellite system. The first launch of a commercial satellite is to take place in the early months of this year.
Through the initiative of the United States an international joint venture has been established. Under the law I have designated the Communications Satellite Corporation as the United States participant. The Corporation is to be the manager on behalf of all participants.
The Corporation has now been financed, has constituted its first Board of Directors to replace the original Incorporators and has moved forward with its program. All agencies of the government with responsibilities under the Act have made important and faithful contributions with the sympathetic assistance of the Congressional committees concerned.
The new and extraordinary satellite telecommunications medium bringing peoples around the globe into closer relationship is nearer to fulfillment, heralding a new day in world communications.
As required by Section 404(a) of the Communications Satellite Act, I herewith transmit to the Congress a report on the national program for development and application of the communications satellite technology to the services of mankind.
