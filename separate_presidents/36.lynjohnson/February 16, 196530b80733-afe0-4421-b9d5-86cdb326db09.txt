Letter in Response to Report on Red Cross Disaster Operations in Oregon and California.
[ Released February 16, 1965. Dated February 10, 1965 ]

Dear Bob:
I'm deeply grateful to you for your excellent report on your inspection of Red Cross Disaster Operations in Oregon and Northern California areas recently ravaged by storms and floods.
It is extremely gratifying to know of the wonderful response of both public and private agencies to the needs of the disaster victims. I'm convinced as you are that the courage and strength of the victims and of those who are aiding them will be sufficient to insure rehabilitation of the area.

Congratulations on another job well done.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable Robert W. Samoff, The American National Red Cross, National Headquarters, Washington, D.C.]
Note: The report of Mr. Samoff, cochairman of the 1965 American Red Cross campaign, is in the form of a letter dated February 5. In evaluating the damage in the Northwest disaster, Mr. Samoff stated that a survey indicated there were 38 deaths, approximately 1,400 homes destroyed, nearly 10,700 homes damaged, and some 800 trailers damaged or destroyed. He estimated that 6,000 families would require long-term recovery assistance from the Red Cross and that more than $5 million in emergency relief and family rehabilitation would be spent by the Red Cross in outright grants.
More than 5,000 Red Cross volunteers and 350 staff workers, the report added, had been working to meet the needs of the disaster victims. Pointing out the "overwhelming spirit of cooperation" among the military, public, and private agencies, Mr. Sarnoff's report emphasized that "all combined to render a highly efficient and effective service in a time of great need."
The report was released with the President's letter.
