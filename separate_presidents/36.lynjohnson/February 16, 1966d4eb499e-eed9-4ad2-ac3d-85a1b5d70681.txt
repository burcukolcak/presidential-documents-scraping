Statement by the President on the Government's Employee Safety Program.
ONE YEAR AGO today I called upon this administration's department and agency heads to reduce the number and cost of injuries to Federal employees 30 percent by 1970.
Since then more than 50 agencies have surveyed their safety problems and developed plans for resolving them.
The first year of Mission SAFETY-70 brought widespread and increased attention to safeguarding those who serve their country in the civilian service of the United States. This is as it should be--there must be constant and vigilant concern for the welfare of the men and women who serve their Nation in the Federal service.
But there can be no letup. I have today requested the heads of all agencies to continue and intensify their efforts and to send to me, by May 1, a summary report of their safety actions and their plans.
Secretary of Labor Wirtz has given me an interim report of some 1965 highlights:

--We have reduced from 5 to over 20 percent the injury frequency rates in a number of larger Federal agencies including the General Services Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Tennessee Valley Authority, Agriculture, Health, Education, and Welfare, Justice, Interior, Veterans Administration, and D.C. Government. These improvements took place in the 9 months immediately following the launching of Mission SAFETY-70.

--We have reduced disabling injuries in 13 of the 19 largest agencies and preliminary figures indicate a 2.4 percent reduction in the overall Federal injury rate.

--In the Atomic Energy Commission we reduced its already low frequency by 30 percent and its private contractors reported a 22 percent reduction last year.
--Sharpe Army Depot near San Francisco, a growing supply link to our fighting forces in Vietnam, reduced its injury frequency over 50 percent in the last 6 months of 1965. As its 3,000 civilian employees entered their February work schedules, they had completed 158 days without a disabling injury.

--The Air Force reports a 19 percent reduction in motor vehicle fatalities last year, reaching its best accident prevention record since 1950.

--Three Department of Treasury units reduced their injury frequency from 20 to over 30 percent. When injuries rose following round-the-clock production of new coins, the U.S. Mint reevaluated and upgraded its safety program.
These examples demonstrate that waste in manpower and resources can be reduced and must be attacked relentlessly. Agency efforts separately, and jointly with the Federal Safety Council have given strength and meaning to Mission SAFETY-70.
I congratulate and commend all agencies on their achievements during the first year of Mission SAFETY-70, but, as we enter the second year of this long-range program to cut the number and costs of accidents, our course is clear.
We must see that our Federal programs bear fruit and stimulate greater safety efforts throughout our Nation and in every community.
On this, the first anniversary of Mission SAFETY-70, I again call upon Federal administrators and employees to provide the necessary leadership and that full measure of support so essential to success.
