Statement by the President Upon Receiving Report of the Industry-Government Special Task Force on Travel.
THE STEPS recommended will help achieve our goal of reducing our travel deficit by $500 million this year. They will have a growing impact in future years.
But promoting travel to the United States will do more than ease our balance of payments problem. It will encourage international understanding. It will give Americans the chance to open their hearts and their homes to travelers from foreign lands.
[These recommendations] will receive prompt attention. The actions and recommendations to increase travel to the United States are an essential part of our program to reduce the Nation's travel deficit.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House release summarizing the report and its major recommendations. The release recalled that the task force was appointed by the President on November 16, 1967, under the chairmanship of Robert M. McKinney, former U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland, to recommend specific measures to increase foreign travel to the United States. The full text of the release is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 4, p. 320).
The report is entitled "Report to the President of the United States From the Industry-Government Special Task Force on Travel" (Government Printing Office, 48 pp.).
