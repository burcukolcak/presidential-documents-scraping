THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION

TO

THE 21ST TACTICAL AIR SUPPORT SQUADRON
The 21st Tactical Air Support Squadron, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary gallantry in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force in Southeast Asia, from 1 August 1965 to 1 February 1966. During this period, personnel of the 21st Tactical Air Support Squadron repeatedly risked their own lives by exposing themselves to hostile ground fire while flying unarmed aircraft in order to effectively identify enemy targets and direct air strikes. Their actions resulted in the success of major ground operations and the saving of hundreds of friendly lives. The extraordinary heroism displayed by this unit in the pursuit of its mission is in keeping with the highest standards of performance and traditions of the United States military service. By their gallantry and untiring devotion to duty, the personnel of the 21st Tactical Air Support Squadron reflect great credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.
