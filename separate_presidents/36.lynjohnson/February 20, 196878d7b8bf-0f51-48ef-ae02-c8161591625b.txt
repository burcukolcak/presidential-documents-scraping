Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of the Civil Service Commission.
To the Congress of the United States:
The Civil Service Commission Annual Report for fiscal 1967 reflects the importance of the most vital element in democratic government-the people who administer it, particularly those who quietly dedicate their lives to public service in the Executive Branch.
The 90th Congress has demonstrated its appreciation of our career public servants. Today's Government is more responsive because of your response.
The Civil Service Commission Report shows that our emphasis has been on recruiting, developing and fully using our civil servants to provide improved service to the public.

During fiscal year 1967--

• An Executive Assignment System was instituted to insure that, at the top career levels, the right man is found for the right job at the right time.

• The Federal recruiting and examining program--the foundation for good personnel management--was reorganized:

--to compete more effectively for the best available manpower and

--to provide improved service, information and job opportunities to every American.

• The training and education of Government employees was modernized and expanded.

• The Federal Government accelerated its drive for equal employment opportunities.
Last December the Congress responded fully to my proposals for equitable pay for Government workers. In moving to fulfill the earlier pay comparability promise, we have made Government jobs and public service careers substantially more attractive.
The record is one of significant progress.
At the same time, problems remain--some of which require legislative action.
As our society has grown more complex, so too has the administration of the public services which meet society's needs. Administrative weakness at any level of our Federal system--whether it be national, state or local--becomes a weakness at all levels. It deprives our citizens of adequate government machinery with which to meet their day-to-day and long-range needs. It cannot long be tolerated in a government of, by, and for the people.
We have become aware that state and local public agencies--too often inadequately staffed--are not always equipped to meet their expanding responsibilities to

--Rebuild our cities,

--Clean up our rivers and the air we breathe,

--Provide equal rights and equal opportunities for all our citizens,

--Plan and build better housing,

--Improve education and health services.

To do their share, state and local governments need help--primarily staffing and training assistance.
Last March 17, I submitted to the Congress two new legislative proposals to give them the help they need:

--The Intergovernmental Manpower Act, to assist state and local governments in meeting their critical manpower requirements. The Act would authorize the Federal Government to assist States and communities in recruiting, training, and developing a high quality corps of capable and responsive public employees. It would authorize the exchange of personnel between states and cities and the Federal Government. Through this exchange, all levels of government would understand each other's problems and work together more effectively to serve all the people.
--The Education for Public Service Act, to increase the number and quality of younger people preparing for careers in government. The Act would provide special fellowships for young men and women who will agree to embark on the great adventure of public service. It would assist colleges and universities in developing public service curricula to meet future governmental needs.
I urge prompt consideration and passage of this legislation to strengthen our Federal system and assure more efficient conduct of programs with shared administrative responsibilities.
Our mission--to meet the rapidly changing needs of our society--calls for our continued attention to excellence in the public service. I pledge you and the Nation mine.
