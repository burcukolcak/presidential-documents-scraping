Lyndon B. Johnson
February 28, 1967

Statement by the President on His Message on Education and Health.
TODAY the Congress has received my fourth message on education and health.
This message does not recommend more of what we have, out more that is better:
--better teachers for our poor,
--better use of educational television,
--better training for dropouts and for the handicapped,
--better health and safety standards for all of our workers,
--better research to combat cancer, and
--better facilities to protect the health of all Americans.
America's goal is the healthiest and the best educated society the world has ever known. These proposals reflect our determination to succeed in that quest.
