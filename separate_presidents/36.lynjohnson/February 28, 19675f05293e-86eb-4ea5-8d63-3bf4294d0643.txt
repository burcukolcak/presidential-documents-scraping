The President's Remarks to the Press Upon Announcing His Intention To Nominate Ramsey Clark as Attorney General.
THE PRESIDENT. I have asked the Deputy Attorney General and the Acting Attorney General, Mr. Clark, to serve as Attorney General. His name will go to the Senate this afternoon.
Mr. Christian will give you a biographical sketch.
I think the things you will be primarily interested in are: He was born December 18, 1927. I think all of you know that he is the son of Justice Clark and Mary Ramsey Clark. His mother's father, Judge Ramsey, was one of the great lawyers from our State for many years. I think you know about his father.
He was nominated Assistant Attorney General in February 1961 by President Kennedy. He served in that capacity until February 1965. He was nominated Deputy Attorney General on January 28, 1965, and is still serving as Acting Attorney General.
Q. Mr. President, does the fact that his father is on the Supreme Court present any problem?
THE PRESIDENT. It is a problem for his father. I haven't discussed it with his father or with his son.
Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.
Note: The President spoke at 3:40 p.m. in his office at the White House. During his remarks he referred to Judge William F. Ramsey of the Texas Supreme Court. Ramsey Clark was present when the President made the announcement.
Shortly after the President's announcement, Associate Justice Tom C. Clark stated that he would retire from the Supreme Court in order to avoid any semblance of conflict of interest.
