Lyndon B. Johnson
January 03, 1964

Remarks Recorded at the LBJ Ranch for Broadcast in Germany.
I WOULD LIKE to send my greetings for the New Year to the good people of Berlin. Berlin continues to stand as a citadel of freedom. In 1961, when the wall was built to divide your great city, I came to Berlin to pledge the support of the United States of America. Last year President Kennedy reaffirmed that pledge. As we begin 1964, I want you to know that the people of the United States stand behind the people of Berlin and that the resolve of our commitments remain unshaken.
We have just concluded a most interesting and most profitable conference between the Chancellor of Germany and the President of the United States. We had as our guest here at the LBJ Ranch for several days Chancellor Erhard. And I think in the weeks and months ahead, you will see the fruits that flow from that very fine visit.
