Lyndon B. Johnson
January 10, 1969

Statement by the President on the Retirement of the President's Physician, Vice Adm. George G. Burkley, USN.
VICE ADMIRAL BURKLEY has served two Presidents, President Kennedy and myself, and an entire generation of servicemen, with high distinction, loyalty, and great skill. He is a healer who honors the tradition of his profession. He is going on the retired list now after an active duty career that began the day after Pearl Harbor. He leaves with my enduring gratitude and that of the two White House staffs he has served so ably.
Note: The statement was read by Acting Press Secretary Wyatt Thomas Johnson, Jr., at his news conference at 11 a.m. on Friday, January 10, 1969. It was not made public in the form of a White House press release.
