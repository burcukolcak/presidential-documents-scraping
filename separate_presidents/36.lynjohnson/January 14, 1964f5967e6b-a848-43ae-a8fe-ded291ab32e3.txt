Telegram to Governor Sanford on His Attack on Poverty in North Carolina.
I WANT to congratulate you on your initiative in mobilizing for an attack on poverty in North Carolina. Please convey to those at your conference today my heartfelt wishes for the success of your efforts. As you know, my State of the Union Message proposed an all-out war on poverty in America. I am confident that the Congress will respond to this challenge. The North Carolina Fund promises to make an exciting and important contribution to this deep-seated problem. I want to assure you of the full cooperation of the Federal departments whose programs contribute to the war on poverty.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable Terry Sanford, Governor of North Carolina, Raleigh, North Carolina]
