Letter to the Postmaster General Approving Recommendations for Improving Postal Services.
[Released January 15, 1966. Dated January 14, 1966]
Dear Mr. Postmaster General:
I approve your recommendations to improve postal service by increasing post office window hours and by restoring six-day parcel post delivery service.
I have said in the past, and I repeat now, that I want you to provide this country with the finest mail service it has ever known, while managing the Post Office Department efficiently and prudently. I want you to explore all the techniques available to modernize our postal service and make certain that they are being used to provide the American people with the best postal system in the world at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer.
A good, stable, dependable postal system is vital to the well-being of the nation's economy.
I therefore intend to seek the necessary funds from the Congress to restore the postal services that were curtailed in 1964.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable, The Postmaster General, Washington, D.C. 20260]
Note: On the same day the White House announced that, under the Postmaster General's proposal, 6-day parcel post delivery would be restored in 6,091 cities, and post office window service on Saturdays and Sundays would be authorized on an as-needed basis in nearly 15,000 post offices. Late hour window service would also be resumed on weeknights, where needed, and postmasters would be authorized to resume selling money orders on Saturdays as part of the window service restoration in those cities where money order sales had been curtailed.
The release stated that the proposed improvements would be made "as soon as the Congress provides the funds, hopefully within the next 6 months" (2 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs., p. 50).
