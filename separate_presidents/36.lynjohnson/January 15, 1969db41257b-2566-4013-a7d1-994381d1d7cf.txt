Statement by the President Upon Receiving Report on U.S.. Foreign Trade Policy.
STRENGTHENING the position of the United States in world trade has been a constant concern of this administration. Ambassador Roth's recommendations focus on this objective, and they deserve the thoughtful attention of all Americans whose well-being is affected by trade: businessmen, workers, farmers, and consumers generally.
Note: The statement was made public as part of a White House release announcing the submission of the report by William M. Roth, Special Representative for Trade Negotiations. The report was prepared with the collaboration of the Public Advisory Committee on Trade Policy established on August 30, 1968, by Executive Order 11425 (4 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs., p. 1286; 33 F.R. 12363; 3 CFR, 1968 Comp., p. 133). The report, dated January 1969, is entitled "Future United States Foreign Trade Policy: Report to the President Submitted by the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations" (processed, approx. 190 pp.). A summary is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 5, p. 92).
