Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House on Appropriations for the Peace Corps.
Dear Mr. :
I take pleasure in transmitting legislation which would authorize the appropriation of $115 million for the Peace Corps in fiscal year 1965.
The Members of the Congress know how close this program was to the heart of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. The day-to-day achievements of nearly 7,000 American men and women now at or about to depart for work overseas in over 2,400 cities, towns, and hamlets in 46 countries are a living memorial to the 35th President of the United States.
For fiscal year 1964 the Congress appropriated approximately $96 million for the Peace Corps, under an authorization of $102 million. The amount appropriated is sufficient to enable the Peace Corps to reach a level of 10,500 Volunteers by September 1964. The requested Peace Corps authorization for fiscal year 1965 is an increase of $13 million over the amount authorized by the Congress for fiscal year 1964. This increase of less than 15 percent will enable the Peace Corps to expand by a third to reach a level of 14,000 Volunteers by September 1965.
As the Peace Corps concentrates on improving the scope of programs in existence, and as more and more American men and women volunteer for service in the Peace Corps, it is becoming possible to take advantage of economies of size in the Peace Corps budget. The steps which have been taken during the last year to reduce the cost of the Peace Corps will be spelled out in detail in the agency's presentation materials.
In view of these economies, the requested increase in authorization and appropriation is fully consistent with my fiscal year 1965 budget program.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
