Message to the Congress Transmitting First Annual Report on National Housing Goals.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting today the first annual report on National Housing Goals, as required by the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968.
That Act affirmed the national goal of "a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family." It determined that this goal can be achieved by constructing or rehabilitating 26 million housing units in the next decade, 6 million of which will be for low- and moderate-income families.
This report lays out a plan for housing production to meet this goal. It also identifies the potential problems that may be faced in the coming year.

--It notes the sensitivity of residential building to credit conditions.

--It reviews the long-run need for adequate labor, land and materials to maintain an increasing level of construction. The housing goals of the 1968 Act are firm national commitments. I urge the Congress, State and local officials, and concerned individuals to give careful consideration to this report.
