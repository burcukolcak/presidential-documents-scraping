Farewell Message to President Segni of Italy.
Dear Mr. President:
Before you leave for home, I want to tell you how delighted Mrs. Johnson and I were to have you and Mrs. Segni as our guests. We were especially grateful to you for coming at this time and proud to have had this chance to demonstrate the high regard and admiration which we Americans have for the people of Italy and their distinguished Chief of State.
We also greatly appreciated the opportunity for the extended and candid discussions with you and Foreign Minister Saragat of major international issues important to both our countries. These talks demonstrated once again the real identity of interests and understanding which happily characterizes the relations between our peoples and their governments and which is vital to the cause of peace and freedom.
Mrs. Johnson joins me in sending warmest personal regards to you and Mrs. Segni and both of us hope you have a very pleasant and safe journey back to Rome.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
