Statement by the President Urging Preservation of the Big Thicket of Southeast Texas as a Wilderness Area.
FOR 5 YEARS now, we have worked to preserve hundreds of thousands of American acres for the benefit of the people--from the redwoods of California to the shorelines of the East. But too many wild and splendid areas are still outside the people's reach.
The Big Thicket of southeast Texas is such a place. This unique and beautiful woodland can be a source of enjoyment for generations yet to come. We should preserve as much of it as we can without delay. And as quickly as possible, we should add it to our great inventory of national parks and recreation areas.
I urge the people of Texas--and the people of the United States--to act now to save this great wilderness area. I hope we will not lose this chance to put this magnificent part of our heritage into the people's trust, for the enrichment of America forever.
