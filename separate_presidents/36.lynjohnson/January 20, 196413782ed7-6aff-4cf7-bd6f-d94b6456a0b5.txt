Remarks Upon Receiving a United States Army Flag From Senior Commanders of the Army.
Mr. Secretary and General Wheeler:
There is no gift that I receive with more joy and with more reverence than this honored flag. All that we have ever been and all that we ever want to be and all that we ever hope to become is represented in this flag. The courage and the competence of the United States Army and the role that it has always played in the preservation of honor and the preservation of peace is seen in this flag.
You all have a military mission which you never shirk; which you always perform with valor. But there is an additional role in your mission as commanders. That additional role is as challenging as the sacrifices represented by the 145 battle streamers on this flag. That role is to build and to preserve the peace for this Nation and for all time to Come.
You assist me in no greater responsibility when you help me in that objective. Thank you, gentlemen, for presenting me with this proud flag. You represent the noblest and the best that is in America and I am grateful that you should come here and permit me to visit with you individually and collectively on this occasion.
Note: The President spoke in his office at the White House, at 12:15 p.m., to a group of senior Army commanders. His opening words referred to Secretary of the Army Cyrus R. Vance and the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, Gen. Earle G. Wheeler.
The flag was the official United States Army flag adopted on June 13, 1956. The 145 streamers represent the campaigns in which the Army has participated since its inception.
