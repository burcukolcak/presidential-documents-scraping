Proclamation 3891â€”Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Park

Because of the deep debt of gratitude of the American people to Franklin Delano Roosevelt for his leadership in America's struggle for peace, well-being, and human dignity, the Congress established the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission, by the Act of August 11, 1955, 69 Stat. 694, for the purpose of considering and formulating plans for the design, construction, and location of a permanent memorial to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the City of Washington, District of Columbia, or in its immediate environs.
In furtherance of the objectives of that Act, the Act of September 1, 1959, 73 Stat. 445, reserved, for the erection of a memorial to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a site comprising that portion of West Potomac Park in the District of Columbia which lies between Independence Avenue and the inlet bridge, being twenty-seven acres, more or less, and also provided for a competition for the design of such memorial.
Although the Commission has not yet reported to the Congress its selection of an appropriate memorial, it is desirable that the site be maintained, pending the Commission's final determination, as a park dedicated to the memory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,President of the United States of America, do proclaim that the following described land reserved by the Act of September 1, 1959, be designated as the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Park area of the West Potomac Park:
That portion of West Potomac Park, in the District of Columbia, which lies between Independence Avenue and the inlet bridge, being twenty-seven acres, more or less.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.
