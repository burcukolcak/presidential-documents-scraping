Proclamation 3889â€”Establishing Marble Canyon National Monument, Arizona

Whereas,the Marble Canyon of the Colorado River in Arizona, a northerly continuation of the world-renowned Grand Canyon, possesses unusual geologic and paleontologic features and objects and other scientific and natural values; and
Whereas,it appears that the public interest would be promoted by reserving the federally owned lands encompassing Marble Canyon in order to permanently protect such features and objects; and
Whereas,the Advisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings and Monuments, in April 1967, endorsed the preservation and protection of Marble Canyon as a part of the National Park System; and
Whereas,under section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 431), the President is authorized "to declare by public proclamation * * * objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and may reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected:

Johnson,President of the United States, under the authority vested in me by section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906, supra, by the act of June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. 607, 16 U.S.C. 684), and by the act of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat. 34, 16 U.S.C. 473), do proclaim that, subject to valid existing rights, (1) federally owned or controlled lands within the exterior boundaries of the following described area are hereby reserved from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws and set apart as the Marble Canyon National Monument and (2) State-owned lands within those boundaries shall become and be reserved as parts of that monument upon acquisition of title thereto by the United States:
