Proclamation 3888â€”Enlarging the Capitol Reef National Monument, Utah

Whereas,the Capitol Reef National Monument in Utah was established by Proclamation No. 2246 of August 2, 1937, and enlarged by Proclamation No. 3249 of July 2, 1958, to set aside and reserve certain areas possessing significant features and objects of geological and scientific interest; and
Whereas,it would be in the public interest to add to the Capitol Reef National Monument certain adjoining lands which encompass the outstanding geological feature known as Waterpocket Fold and other complementing geological features, which constitute objects of scientific interest, such as Cathedral Valley; and
Whereas,under section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 431), the President is authorized "to declare by public proclamation * * * objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and may reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected:"
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,President of the United States, under the authority vested in me by section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906, supra, do proclaim that, subject to valid existing rights, (1) the lands owned or controlled by the United States within the exterior boundaries of the following described area are hereby added to and made a part of the Capitol Reef National Monument, and (2) the State-owned and privately owned lands within those boundaries shall become and be reserved as parts of that monument upon acquisition of title thereto by the United States:
