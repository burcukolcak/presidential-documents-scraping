Proclamation 3890â€”Enlarging the Katmai National Monument, Alaska

Whereas,the Katmai National Monument in Alaska was established by Proclamation No. 1487 of September 24, 1918, to preserve an area that is of significant importance in the study of volcanism and the monument was subsequently enlarged to include other areas containing features and objects of historical and scientific interest; and
Whereas,only a part of Naknek Lake is included within the present boundaries of the monument and the inclusion of all of such lake and its shores is necessary for the protection of the ecological and other scientific values of this lake and the existing monument; and
Whereas,under section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 431), the President is authorized "to declare by public proclamation * * * objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and may reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected:"
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,President of the United States, under the authority vested in me by section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906, supra, do proclaim that, subject to valid existing rights, the lands owned or controlled by the United States within the following described boundary are hereby added to and made a part of the Katmai National Monument:
