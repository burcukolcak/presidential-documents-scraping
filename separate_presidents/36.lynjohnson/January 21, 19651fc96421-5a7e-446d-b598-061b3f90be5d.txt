Statement by the President to the Members of the Committee on Nuclear Proliferation.
YESTERDAY the Nation reaffirmed its dedication to the pursuit of peace. Today, we find that problem, once again, first on our national agenda.
Tomorrow and in the years ahead, our future and the future of the world will be shaped in no small measure by what we now do in the face of the complex and difficult problems posed by the spread of nuclear weapons.
I am grateful, therefore, that such distinguished and experienced men have today given me and my advisers the benefit of their patient and searching counsel.
Note: The President read the statement at 1 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House.
