Statement by the President on Senator Lister Hill's Decision To Retire From the Senate.
LISTER HILL has been a giant in the Congress for nearly four and a half decades. He has built an enduring monument of good works, especially in the field of health. He will be sorely missed.
Note: Senator Lister Hill of Alabama served in the House of Representatives 1923-1938 and in the Senate since 1938. The President's statement followed an announcement by Senator Hill that he planned to retire at the end of the 90th Congress in January 1969.
The statement was posted on the bulletin board in the Press Room at the White House. It was not made public in the form of a White House press release.
