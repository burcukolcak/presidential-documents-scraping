Lyndon B. Johnson
January 24, 1964

Remarks at the Swearing In of Donald F. Hornig as Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology.
Ladies and gentlemen:
We are delighted to welcome you here to witness the swearing in of Dr. Hornig.
Doctor, we welcome you to this room. It will be the scene of many future meetings for you. We look forward to receiving your advice and counsel and the benefit of your wisdom.
You are following an extremely able and very dedicated man, a man upon whom President Kennedy leaned heavily, and who has been a tower of strength to me during his entire period of service.
We hate to see him go; but since he is going we are glad to have his choice succeed him. Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 4:30 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House. At the same time Dr. Hornig was named Chairman of the Federal Council for Science and Technology. He became Director of the Office of Science and Technology following approval of his nomination by the Senate on January 27.
These positions had been held by Dr. Jerome B. Wiesner who after a 3-year leave of absence was returning to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The text of the President's letter to Dr. Wiesner upon his resignation was released by the White House on January 24, 1964.
