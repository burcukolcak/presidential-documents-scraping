Statement by the President on the Death of Winston Churchill.
WHEN THERE was darkness in the world, and hope was low in the hearts of men, a generous Providence gave us Winston Churchill.
As long as men tell of that time of terrible danger and of the men who won the victory, the name of Churchill will live.
Let us give thanks that we knew him. With our grief let there be gratitude for a life so fully lived, for services so splendid, and for the joy he gave by the joy he took in all he did.
The people of the United States--his cousins and his fellow citizens--will pray with his British countrymen for God's eternal blessing on this man, and for comfort to his family.
He is History's child, and what he said and what he did will never die.
Note: In addition to the foregoing statement the President issued Executive Order 11193 (30 F.R. 821; 3 CFR, 1965 Supp.) which provided that as a mark of respect to the memory of Mr. Churchill, an honorary citizen of the United States, the flag of the United States should be flown at half-staff on all Government buildings, military facilities, and naval vessels and stations in the United States and foreign countries until interment.
The statement was released at the U.S. Naval Hospital, Bethesda, Md., where the President was receiving treatment for a cold.
