Proclamation 3635â€”National Poison Prevention Week, 1965

Most of our medicines and common household products, when used as intended or directed, contribute to the health and Well-being of the American people. The improper labeling, handing, storage, and disposal of such medicines and products, however, may result in serious injury or death by accidental poisoning.
Each year thousands of children, too young to make distinctions, are the victims of such accidental poisonings. Adults, and others responsible for child care, can reduce or eliminate these hazards by exercising greater care in the use, handling, and disposal of these potentially harmful products.
To aid in encouraging the American people to learn of the dangers of accidental poisoning and to take such preventive measures as are Warranted, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved September 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 681), requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating the third week in March as National Poison Prevention Week:
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,President of the United States of America; do hereby proclaim the week beginning March 14, 1965, as National Poison Prevention Week.
I direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government, and I invite State and local governments and organizations interested in child safety, to participate actively in programs designed to promote better protection against accidental poisonings.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 28th day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-ninth.


LYNDON B. JOHNSON

GEORGE W. BALL,
