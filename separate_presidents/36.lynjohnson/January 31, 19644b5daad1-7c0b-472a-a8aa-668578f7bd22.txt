Statement by the President on Recent Advances in federal Personnel Management.
I AM transmitting to the Congress today the 1963 Annual Report of the U.S. Civil Service Commission.
I am highly pleased with the advances made in improving federal personnel programs. This progress has contributed to efficiency and economy. It has made Government a better employer of able men and women, of all races and creeds, in their service to the American people.
These actions were of special importance in achieving this improvement:
Increased emphasis on recruiting outstanding people to staff vital federal programs.
Positive actions to insure equal employment opportunities for all qualified citizens, including women, members of minority groups, handicapped persons, and older workers.
Initiation of training and career development programs to increase productivity.
Promotion of better utilization of employee effort.
Implementation of the federal Salary Reform Act of 1962, one of the most important federal personnel laws enacted during the last decade.
Extension of affirmative cooperation in employee-management relations.
The Commission has carried out these programs with substantial economies in its operations. I am impressed with the reduction of $2 million in annual costs of performing full-field investigations for other agencies.
I shall look for further progress in program development and productivity in periodic reports the Civil Service Commission will be making to me in coming months. The gains of 1963 must be sustained and extended in the future in order to meet the demands of essential federal programs now and in the months ahead.
