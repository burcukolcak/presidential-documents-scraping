Statement by the President Upon Making Public the Names of the 1964 Recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
THESE individuals add distinction to this high award. Each person we honor has previously honored his fellow man by setting for himself a standard of excellence only he was able to achieve.
Collectively, they have made man's world safe, his physical body more durable, his mind broader, his leisure more delightful, his standard of living higher, and his dignity important.
They are creators; we are the beneficiaries.
Note: The statement is part of a White House release announcing the President's selection of the 1964 recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civil honor the President of the United States can bestow.
