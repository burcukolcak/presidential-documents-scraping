Statement by the President on the Death of Roy E. Davidson.
I WANT to express my deep sorrow at the passing of Roy E. Davidson. Last winter, when this Nation faced a critical time in the railroad dispute, I asked Mr. Davidson and the other men of both sides to help preserve collective bargaining in America. He accepted that challenge, as he did others in his long and accomplished career. He was a fine man, a good citizen, an honest leader of men. His union and his Nation both benefited from the achievements of his life.
Note: The statement was read by the Press Secretary to the President, George E. Reedy, at his news conference held at the White House at 11:16 a.m. on July 8, 1964.
