Presidential Unit Citation Awarded the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing, Pacific Air Forces.
CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION TO THE 3D TACTICAL FIGHTER WING
The 3d Tactical Fighter Wing, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism while participating in combat operations against an opposing armed force in Southeast Asia from 8 June 1966 to 16 April 1967. During this period, members of the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing flew more than 50,000 combat missions in support of friendly forces under attack. The gallantry, heroism, and determination displayed by the personnel of the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing have saved countless allied and American lives and accounted for over 14,000 enemy killed by air action. Despite extremely hazardous conditions, including adverse weather, low level night operations, and extensive exposure to accurate hostile fire, the pilots of the Wing have successfully delivered their ordnance within unprecedented proximity to beleaguered friendly forces. These devastatingly precise attacks, made without regard for personal safety, have stopped hostile attacks at the very perimeter of American positions and turned near defeats into overwhelming victories. The resolute dedication, professionalism, and extraordinary heroism displayed by the personnel of the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing are in keeping with the highest standards of performance and traditions of the United States military service, and reflect the highest credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.
