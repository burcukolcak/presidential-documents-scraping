Special Message to the Senate on the Convention on Transit Trade of Land-Locked States
To the Senate of the United States:
Today, I ask the Senate to give its advice and consent to ratification by the United States of the Convention on Transit Trade of Land-Locked States.
This Convention was adopted by the United Nations Conference on Transit Trade of Land-Locked Countries on July 8, 1965. It was signed on behalf of the United States on December 30, 1965.
The purpose of the Convention is to incorporate into treaty law the rights and obligations of land-locked states, and of their transit state neighbors, regarding the movement of goods in international transit trade.
Though the Convention does not directly affect the United States, it would benefit our trading community, by helping to lessen administrative difficulties encountered in transit trade.
By becoming a party to the Convention, the United States would show its support for solving many of the transit problems of landlocked states, long a source of irritation in several areas of the world.
I enclose, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State on the Convention.
I recommend that the Senate give favorable consideration to United States ratification of the Convention.
