Statement by the President on Narcotic and Drug Abuse.
NARCOTIC and other drug abuse is inflicting upon parts of the country enormous damage in human suffering, crime, and economic loss through thievery. The Federal Government, being responsible for the regulation of foreign and interstate commerce, bears a major responsibility in respect to the illegal traffic in drugs and the consequences of that traffic. That responsibility is shared by several departments of the Government and by a number of divisions, bureaus, etc., within them.
I now direct those units to examine into their present procedures, to bring those procedures into maximum activity, and, wherever necessary, put into effect additional programs of action aimed at major corrections in the conditions caused by drug abuse. I desire the full power of the Federal Government to be brought to bear upon three objectives: (1) the destruction of the illegal traffic in drugs, (2) the prevention of drug abuse, and (3) the cure and rehabilitation of victims of this traffic. Attention is called to the program described in the report of the President's Advisory Commission on Narcotic and Drug Abuse.
For the purpose of coordinating the steps to be taken by the several units of the Government in this matter I designate Lee White of the White House Staff to act as liaison agent between them, with instructions to implement the foregoing directive.
Note: The "Final Report of the President's Advisory Commission on Narcotic and Drug Abuse" is dated November 1963 (123 pp., Government Printing Office). For the President's letter to Judge E. Barrett Prettyman in response to the Commission's final report, see Item 159.
