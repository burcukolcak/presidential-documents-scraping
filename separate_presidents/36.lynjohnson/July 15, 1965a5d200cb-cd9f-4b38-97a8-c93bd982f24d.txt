Letter to Mrs. Francis A. Cherry on the Death of Her Husband.
Dear Mrs. Cherry:
With sadness and grief, I join all who mourn the death of Francis Cherry, respected judge, able Governor of Arkansas, and dedicated servant of the public good.
I particularly want to express my sympathy to his family and dear ones, and to the countless citizens of Arkansas who have lost in his passing a distinguished leader, and a native son whose devotion to constitutional principles and human dignity won for him the confidence and admiration of all who knew him.
His life has left for his State and nation a rich legacy of accomplishment.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mrs. Francis A. Cherry, 5324 Albemarle Street NW., Washington, D.C.]
Note: Francis A. Cherry served as a member of the Subversive Activities Control Board from May 16, 1960, to January 31, 1963, and as Chairman of the Board from January 31, 1963, to March 4, 1965. He was Governor of Arkansas 1953-1955.
