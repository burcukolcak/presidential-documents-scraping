Letter Concerning the Issuance of a Commemorative Stamp Marking the 700th Anniversary of the Birth of Dante Alighieri.
[Released July 17, 1965. Dated July 15, 1965] Dear Chairman Re:
It gives me pleasure to join the millions of our citizens paying tribute to the immortal memory of Dante Alighieri on the 700th anniversary of his birth. A commemorative stamp in honor of this great Son of Italy is a fitting tribute to the universal contributions of an illustrious man who belongs to every age and to people of all ages.
Through his genius and creative achievement, Dante became forever a citizen of the world. Poet, philosopher, musician, political scientist and psychologist, Dante's renowned accomplishments are a lasting testament to his fully and richly rewarding life.
Dante's immortal Divine Comedy, with its sublime message of faith and hope, is his best known and most widely respected work. But for those who are charged with administering their nation's affairs, his provocative political ideas, expressed in his other literary masterpieces, have enduring meaning and significance.
I am both proud and happy to express at this time my congratulations to our entire Italian American community for sustaining in their new home the revered ideals and traditions of the old. You have my personal good wishes on this memorable occasion.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable Edward D. Re, Chairman, Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United States]
Note: The Postmaster General had requested Mr. Re to serve as chairman of a nationwide Italian-American Committee sponsoring the anniversary celebration.
