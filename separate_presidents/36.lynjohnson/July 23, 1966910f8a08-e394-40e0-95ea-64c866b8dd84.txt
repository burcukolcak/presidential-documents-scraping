Statement by the President Announcing a Grant for a Recreational Facility at Lake Barkley State Park, Kentucky.
I AM PLEASED to announce approval of Kentucky's request for a grant from the Economic Development Administration for the development of a national outdoor facility at Lake Barkley State Park.
The amount of the Federal grant is $3,972,000 to be matched equally by funds provided by the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
The public facility which will be constructed with these funds will add to and complete the other facilities planned for the Kentucky Lake, and Lake Barkley and the national recreation areas being developed by the Tennessee Valley Authority at the lakes. All these facilities will provide recreational opportunities for 70 million Americans who will be located within a day's drive from this area. It will also be available to servicemen and their families stationed at Fort Campbell.
The immediate area adjacent to the site of this project is an area of economic need and meets all of the tests outlined in the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.
We are convinced that the development will make a material contribution to the economic well-being of this area. This area, which is jointly being developed by Federal, State, and private enterprise, is destined to become one of our Nation's most attractive and best outdoor recreation areas.
