Lyndon B. Johnson
July 23, 1968

Statement by the President on the Death of Mrs. Margaret Price.
IT IS with deep regret that Mrs. Johnson and I learn of the death of Margaret Price, who gave so unstintingly of herself to her family, her friends, her country, and her party.
We shall all miss her and I know, especially, those women of the Democratic Party, who looked to her for inspiration and leadership. Having first served as a precinct delegate, she quickly rose in the ranks to county chairman, congressional district chairman, and national committeewoman. In 1960 she was elected vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
She made a lasting contribution to the high standards of giving her best to the democratic process of this country. She served President Kennedy and me with competence and complete loyalty.
Note: The statement was released at Austin, Texas.
