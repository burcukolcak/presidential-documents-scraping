Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Relating to Fishing in the Territorial Waters of the United States.
I HAVE today signed into law S. 1752, "To amend the Act prohibiting fishing in the territorial waters of the United States and in certain other areas by vessels other than vessels of the United States and by persons in charge of such vessels."
Under the Act which the present bill amends, it is unlawful for foreign vessels to fish in the United States territorial waters or in the contiguous 9-mile fisheries zone. Exceptions may be made for rights recognized by international agreement.
While existing law has proven effective in preserving our fisheries for United States nationals, some uncertainty has existed as to precisely what activities are prohibited within the contiguous fishery zone. To remove this uncertainty and clarify the application of the law to activities unique to fisheries operations, S. 1752 prohibits foreign vessels from engaging in activities in support of a foreign fishery fleet in the contiguous zone.
It is clear that the language of this bill should be interpreted in accordance with international law.
The United States believes that international law recognizes the right of a coastal State to prohibit, within a contiguous fishery zone, activities that are unique to fishing operations; but that it does not sanction controls that interfere with freedoms of the high seas--such as freedom of navigation. Nor should prohibitions be placed on activities that have not customarily been subjected to control as fisheries activities.
The United States will, therefore, enforce this legislation in consonance with the requirements of international law.
Note: As enacted, the bill (S. 1752) is Public Law 90-427 (81 Stat. 445).
