Lyndon B. Johnson
July 29, 1964

Statement by the President on Announcing a White House Meeting of the Presidents of State Universities.
THE White House meeting will be an intellectual convocation of the States. Its object will be to get underway in each State a study group of the highest expertness--consisting of men and women drawn from all the faculties in the State and of experts outside the universities--which at a specific time will be ready to report on the problems and possibilities of that particular State and region during the coming decades.
Our American system is the happy one of federalism. Both the Federal Government and the States have always exercised leadership in solving the problems of the Nation. Through this conference, I hope to lend whatever help I can to the exciting process of revitalization now going on in our 50 States.
Note: The statement was not made public in the form of a White House press release. It was read by the Press Secretary to the President, George E. Reedy, at his news conference held at the White House at 4:25 p.m. on July 29, 1964, at which time he announced that a meeting of presidents of leading State universities would be held at the White House on August 13.
