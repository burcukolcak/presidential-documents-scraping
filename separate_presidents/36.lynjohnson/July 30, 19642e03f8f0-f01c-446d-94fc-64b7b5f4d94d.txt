Statement by the President Relating to the Selection of a Vice Presidential Candidate.
IN REFERENCE to the selection of a candidate for Vice President on the Democratic ticket, I have reached the conclusion that it would be inadvisable for me to recommend to the convention any member of the Cabinet or any of those who meet regularly with the Cabinet. In this regard, because their names have been mentioned in the press, I have personally informed the Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk; the Secretary of Defense, Mr. McNamara; the Attorney General, Mr. Kennedy; the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Freeman, of my decision.
I have communicated this to the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Mr. Stevenson, and the head of the Peace Corps, Mr. Shriver. In this manner, the list has been considerably narrowed. I shall continue to give the most thoughtful consideration to the choice of the man that I will recommend to the convention and I shall make my decision known in due course.
Note: The President read the statement shortly after 6 p.m. to reporters in the Fish Room at the White House.
