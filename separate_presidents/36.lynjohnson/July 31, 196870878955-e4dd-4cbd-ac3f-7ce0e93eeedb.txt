Message to President Trejos Following the Eruption of a Volcano in Costa Rica.
Dear Mr. President:
I was distressed to learn that a long dormant volcano has erupted in Costa Rica resulting in considerable loss of life, personal injury and material damage.

I am asking our Embassy to work with you on emergency relief measures. Please let us know how we can be of help.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable Jose Joaquin Trejos Fernandez, President of Costa Rica]
