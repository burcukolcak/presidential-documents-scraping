Lyndon B. Johnson
July 31, 1968

Statement by the President Following the Presentation at a Cabinet Meeting of a Report on the Social and Economic Conditions of American Negroes.
THE LATEST DATA reveal once again the great social and economic gap between black and white Americans. But the data also show that there has been continuing progress--in some cases dramatic progress-in narrowing that gap over the past few years.
To me, the report issued today by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics gives a very important dual message about America. It is this: We can make social progress--and much progress remains to be made.
This report refutes those who preach despair--for it shows clearly that our society is on the move and that black Americans are successfully gaining a better life for themselves and their children.
This report also refutes those who say "Negroes are moving ahead too fast." Today, in the year 1968--more than a century after the Emancipation Proclamation--the average Negro family in America is earning only 59 percent as much as the average white family.
So the task of providing full opportunity still remains ahead of us. We can see from this report that our efforts in the recent past have not been in vain. I believe that my program currently before the Congress will help to continue this progress for all Americans-both black and white. If passed, it will provide jobs and education, better health and aid to cities.
The data in this report show that we have begun to build up momentum in solving the age-old problems of poverty and discrimination. For the sake of our country, we must move more swiftly still--to close the gap that divides Negro Americans from a life of achievement and security.
Note: The report is entitled "Recent Trends in Social and Economic Conditions of Negroes in the United States," July 1968 (BLS Report No. 347; Current Population Reports, Series P-23, No. 26; Government Printing Office, 29 pp.).
