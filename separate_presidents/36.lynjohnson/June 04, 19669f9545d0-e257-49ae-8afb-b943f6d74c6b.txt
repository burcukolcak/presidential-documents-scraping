Statement by the President on the Fifth Anniversary of the Central American Common Market.
ON THIS fifth anniversary of the Central American Common Market, we salute our Central American friends for what they have accomplished by placing the common good of the region above more narrow interests.
The facts speak for themselves: Trade between the five partner-nations has more than quadrupled since the Common Market came into being 5 years ago. In 1960 intraregional trade amounted to $32 million; in 1965 it amounted to $130 million.
This is a triumph for idealism plus good business sense.
It is no coincidence that in 1965 the Central American region as a whole achieved an increase of 2 1/2 percent in gross national product per capita, which is the yearly minimum target of the Alliance for Progress. This achievement stems from the same spirit of enlightened statesmanship and imaginative self-help which have made the Central American Common Market one of the brightest success stories in Latin American development.
We hail the Central American Common Market as a giant stride toward the eventual goal of Latin American regional economic integration. What it has accomplished in so short a time should serve as a stimulus for the achievement of the larger goal. We pledge our continuing support for this young, progressive Central American institution--and for the Latin American regional movement--which are so fully in keeping with the Charter of Punta del Este.
Note: The Central American Common Market was established by the Charter of the General Treaty on Central American Economic Integration, signed on December 13, 1960, at Managua, Nicaragua, by Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. It went into effect on June 3, 1961. The text of the Charter is printed in the United Nations Treaty Series (vol. 455, P. 3).
