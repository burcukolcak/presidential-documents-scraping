The President's Toast to President Schick.
Mr. President:
You and the distinguished members of your party come to Washington as friends and collaborators.
We have been impressed by your achievements in bringing new levels of stability and prosperity to your nation.
We share the pride of Nicaragua and your sister republics in the great strides made within the Central American Common Market. Together you are blazing important trails in the quest of Latin American economic integration.
We are mindful of the support which you have given to the common cause of the free world in Vietnam and the Dominican Republic.
You have done your country great honor by your important visits to mutual friends in Europe and the Near East.
It is a genuine pleasure to have you again in our midst--in this house. As you say in Spanish, Esta en su casa.
I ask you to raise your glasses with me in honor of President Schick of the Republic of Nicaragua, whose country and whose people are represented here today by our friend, President Schick.
Note: The President proposed the toast at a luncheon in the State Dining Room at the White House. As printed above, this item follows the advance text released by the White House.
