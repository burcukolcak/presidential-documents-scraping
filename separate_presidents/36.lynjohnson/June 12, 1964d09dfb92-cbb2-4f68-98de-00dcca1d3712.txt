Statement by the President on the Need for Excellence in Athletic Achievements.
GENERAL James M. Gavin has met with the Attorney General and me to discuss the overall problem of providing American youth with an opportunity to achieve high standards of excellence in sports.
As a Nation we have always prided ourselves on the athletic achievements of our youth. We have encouraged our young people to become more proficient in athletic activities while obtaining an education suiting them for their role in the life of our communities. This balanced approach should not be sacrificed.
The problem is a rather complex one involving the interest of many amateur athletic bodies and many interested individuals. I have requested General Gavin to look into the problem and to study the possibilities of establishing a foundation to assist us in this effort.
Note: The President's opening words referred to Lt. Gen. James M. Gavin, USA, retired.
