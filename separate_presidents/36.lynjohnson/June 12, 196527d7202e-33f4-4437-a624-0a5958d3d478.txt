Statement by the President on Rate Reductions by the Rural Electric Cooperatives.
THE REDUCTION in rates for electricity used by farmers and other rural residents is as significant as a gain in rural income. The objective of the REA program throughout its existence has been to achieve parity of electric service and costs between city and country. I am gratified that the cooperatives are applying their resources and growing skills to keep faith with this important objective and purpose of our rural electrification program.
Note: The President's statement was part of a White House release which announced that a new record would be set in fiscal year 1966 by rural electric cooperatives on reductions of rates to their consumers. The release stated, in part, "With the end of the current fiscal year approaching 112 rural electric systems financed by the Rural Electrification Administration have made rate reductions this year which will amount to a savings of more than $3.8 million annually to consumers ....
"Eighty-six other rural electric systems presently are considering rate reductions, which, if adopted, will amount to another $3 million in annual savings to consumers .... "
