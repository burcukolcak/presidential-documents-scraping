Remarks to the Press Announcing the Nomination of Warren Christopher as Deputy Attorney General.
THE PURPOSE of asking you to come in is that upon the Attorney General's recommendation, we will nominate today and send to the Senate the nomination of Mr. Warren Christopher of California to be Deputy U.S. Attorney General.
Mr. Christopher is 41 years of age. He is married and has three children. He is a member of a Los Angeles law firm and a former law clerk to Justice Douglas.
George Christian will give you the details and the biographical sketch.
Mr. Christopher was born in North Dakota.
As you know, the Deputy Attorney General is the second ranking post in the Department.
Mr. Christopher is a graduate of the University of Southern California, 1945; Stanford University, Palo Alto, law degree; the Stanford Law Review president; law clerk to Justice Douglas, 1949-1950; U.S. Delegation of International Textile Negotiations in Geneva and Tokyo, in 1961; the law firm of O'Melveny and Myers.
Mr. Christopher came to Washington at my request last night with Mr. Califano, who had been in California on other matters yesterday. He had been recommended to me earlier by the Attorney General.
We completed our investigations. He agreed this morning to accept the appointment. The appointment will be sent to the Senate as soon as they convene this morning.
We think we are very fortunate to have this very able, experienced young man join the very fine team that we have in this administration, particularly in the Justice Department, headed by Mr. Clark.
Note: The President spoke to the press at 11:45 a.m. in his office at the White House. Mr. Christopher was present for the announcement. The biographical sketch, to which the President referred, is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 3, p. 879).
