Lyndon B. Johnson
June 20, 1968

Statement by the President Following House Committee Approval of the Gun Control Bill.
I APPLAUD the action of the House Judiciary Committee in its overwhelming endorsement of my request of last week to enact stringent controls over the interstate sales of shotguns, rifles, and ammunition. The American people have had enough of murder at muzzle point by shotgun and rifle. The action by the House Committee today is a major step forward in the protection of our homes and our families, and the security of every citizen.

Each day brings tragic new evidence of the toll of death and destruction at gunpoint. I have just received from the Federal Bureau of Investigation the following report. In 1967, there were:
--7,700 murders with guns, compared with 6,500 in 1966;

--55,000 aggravated assaults with guns, compared with 43,000 in 1966;

--over 71,000 robberies with guns, compared with 60,000 in 1966.
I repeat again what I told the American people June 5. What in the name of conscience will it take to pass a truly effective gun control law?
I urge the leaders in both the House and the Senate to schedule this bill for floor action before they take their next recess over the July 4th weekend.
Note: The Gun Control Act of 1968 was approved by the President on October 22, 1968 (see Item 553).
For the President's address to the Nation on June 5, 1968, see Item 293.
The President requested approval of the gun control bill by the House Judiciary Committee in a statement of June 11, 1968 (see Item 302).
