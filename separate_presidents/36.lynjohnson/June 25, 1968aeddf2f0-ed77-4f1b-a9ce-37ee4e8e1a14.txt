CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT
CITATION TO THE 8TH TACTICAL FIGHTER WING
The 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism, outstanding professionalism, and exceptional dedication to mission accomplishment in action against enemy forces in Southeast Asia from 16 December 1966 to 2 January 1967. Given the task to prepare for and to conduct a maximum attack on enemy aircraft while continuing its normal combat missions, personnel of the Wing met the task with comprehensive planning, careful preparation, extra effort and aggressive execution. The gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps shown by the men of the Wing led to a highly successful fighter sweep on 2 January 1967. Displaying superb airmanship and outstanding combat professionalism, aircrews of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing destroyed seven MIG-21 high performance aircraft within a 15 minute period without loss or damage to friendly aircraft. This outstanding aerial achievement, carried out under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions, significantly reduced the hostile forces' fighter defenses thereby making an important contribution to the Free World forces' ability to maintain air superiority over enemy territory. The outstanding success of the mission testifies to the singular valor and the unselfish devotion to duty displayed by the personnel of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, and reflects great credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.
