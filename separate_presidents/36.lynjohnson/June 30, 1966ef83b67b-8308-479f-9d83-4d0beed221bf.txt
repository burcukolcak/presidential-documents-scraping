Lyndon B. Johnson
June 30, 1966

Statement by the President on the Inauguration of the Medicare Program.
MEDICARE begins tomorrow.
Tomorrow, for the first time, nearly every older American will receive hospital care-not as an act of charity, but as the insured right of a senior citizen.

Since I signed the historic Medicare act last summer, we have made more extensive preparation to launch this program than for any other peaceful undertaking in our Nation's history.
Now we need your help to make Medicare succeed.
Medicare will succeed--if hospitals accept their responsibility under the law not to discriminate against any patient because of race. More than 92 percent of the beds in our Nation's general hospitals are already in compliance with the law.
Medicare will succeed--if doctors treat their patients with fairness and compassion as they have in the past. I feel sure that most doctors do not plan to drive hard bargains with needy patients.
Medicare will succeed--if older patients cooperate in scheduling treatment and do not demand unnecessary hospital and medical services. I have confidence in the commonsense of our older Americans.
This program is not just a blessing for older Americans. It is a test for all Americans--a test of our willingness to work together.
In the past, we have always passed that test. I have no doubt about the future. I believe that July 1, 1966, marks a new day of freedom for our people.
Note: The President also read the statement before television cameras in the Theater at the White House.
The Medicare act was approved by the President on July 30, 1965 (Public Law 89-97, 79 Stat. 286). For the President's remarks on that occasion, see 1965 volume, this series, Book II, Item 394.
