Memorandum on the Processing of Federal Employees' Claims for Workmen's Compensation Benefits
Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
SUBJECT:Delay in Processing Workmen's Compensation Benefits for Federal Employees
While we strive to reduce the number of injuries and accidental deaths occurring in Federal employment, we must be mindful of the hardship and suffering where our efforts have failed. Fortunately, the Federal Employees' Compensation Act provides one of the finest workmen's compensation programs in the country.
For this protection to be fully effective, the flow of family income should not be unduly interrupted. When the breadwinner's wages stop, delays in commencing benefit payments can create severe financial hardships. It has come to my attention that the average delay is now 71 days.
I believe that this excessive delay can be shortened if Federal agencies strive to speed up their reporting procedures and increase the accuracy of their accident reports. Therefore, I am asking the members of my Cabinet and the heads of other Federal agencies to provide a top-level internal review of accident reporting in order to eliminate bottlenecks and develop streamlined procedures. Further, I am asking the Secretary of Labor to make available to other Federal agencies technical advice on this problem.
I believe that with increased diligence, this source of hardship can be diminished.
