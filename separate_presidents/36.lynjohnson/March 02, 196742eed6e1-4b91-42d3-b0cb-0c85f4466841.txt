Message to the People of Puerto Rico on the 50th Anniversary of the Granting of United States Citizenship.
TODAY marks the 50th anniversary of the granting of United States citizenship to the people of Puerto Rico by the Congress of the United States.
The cause of justice and human dignity for which the people of the United States and the people of Puerto Rico share an equal dedication is embodied in our common citizenship. It has formed a strong foundation for our present association, and it gives us confidence that our future relationship will be even more rewarding to both island and mainland.
I am confident that I speak for the people of all the United States when I extend to you felicitations and warmest congratulations on this historic occasion.
