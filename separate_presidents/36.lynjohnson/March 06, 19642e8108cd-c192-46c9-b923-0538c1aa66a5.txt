Letter to Chairman Khrushchev on the Situation in Cyprus.
[ Released March 6, 1964. Dated March 4, 1964 ]
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I have carefully studied the letter you sent to me on February 7 concerning the situation in Cyprus, and I can only conclude that, whatever may have been the motivations of the Soviet Government, your message was based upon a seriously mistaken appreciation both of the situation in Cyprus, and of the aims of the United States in agreeing to lend its assistance in improving that situation. The United States has been cooperating with the governments concerned, including the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, for one purpose alone, that of assisting the Cypriots to restore a peaceful situation in Cyprus.
I will, however, agree fully, Mr. Chairman, with one thought that you expressed in your letter. It is certainly true that avoiding the aggravation of the situation in the eastern Mediterranean is in the general interests of all of us. We should all strive not to inflame passions from without. I can assure you that this is the firm intention of my government, and I sincerely hope, Mr. Chairman, that it is also that of your government.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
