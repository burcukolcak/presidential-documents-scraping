The 121st Aviation Company (Air Mobile Light) and attached units distinguished themselves by extraordinary heroism while engaged in military operations in the Republic of Vietnam on 5 December 1964. The members of this Company and the foregoing units demonstrated indomitable courage and professional skill while providing direct support for a Republic of Vietnam military ground operation in territory known to be dominated by insurgents. Their outstanding effectiveness resulted in the success of aerial troop lifts despite exposure to intensive hostile gunfire, in the timely modification of techniques which kept pace with the rapidly changing tactical situations, and in the on-the-spot field maintenance for aircraft. Prompt medical assistance was given to the combat soldier and a countless number of friendly casualties were quickly evacuated from the battlefield. Through their fortitude, perseverance, and gallant efforts, these brave officers and men contributed in great measure to the progress of the counterinsurgency effort conducted in the Republic of Vietnam. The devotion to duty, outstanding achievements, and extraordinary heroism displayed by the members of the 121st Aviation Company (Air Mobile Light) and the participating units reflect great credit upon themselves and the Armed Forces of the United States.
