Message to the Senate Transmitting the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 .
To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to accession to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, open for signature at New York March 30, 1961 to August 1, 1961, I transmit herewith a copy of the Convention along with the Final Act of the United Nations Conference at which the Convention was adopted.
For nearly sixty years the United States has taken a leading part in international cooperation for the control of narcotic drugs. We should continue this cooperation to the fullest possible extent in combating the scourge of drug abuse.
After a survey by a special task force on the contribution of the Convention to the control of illegal international drug traffic, I have concluded that the national and international interest in drug control will be significantly advanced by United States accession.
I recommend that the Senate give the Convention early and favorable consideration.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
