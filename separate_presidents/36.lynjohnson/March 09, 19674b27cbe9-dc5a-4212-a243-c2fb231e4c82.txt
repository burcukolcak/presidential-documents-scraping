Special Message to the Congress Transmitting Reorganization Plan 2 of 1967: United States Tariff Commission
To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1967, concerning the U.S. Tariff Commission.
The plan is a step toward fulfilling my pledge to the American people that Government must be reshaped to meet the tasks of today. It underscores my conviction that progress can be achieved by building upon what is strong and enduring, but that we shall never hesitate to discard what is inefficient or outmoded.
This plan has a single, clear objective--to strengthen the operations of the Tariff Commission by transferring to its Chairman certain routine executive and administrative functions now divided among its six commissioners.
In taking this long overdue step, the plan adopts a proven concept of good management recommended by the first Hoover Commission: in the interests of efficiency purely administrative functions--budgeting, personnel supervision and general management-should be vested in the chairman of a commission rather than diffused throughout the commission.
This principle was followed by each of my predecessors--Presidents Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and John F. Kennedy.
It has been applied successfully to most of our commissions, including:
--The Federal Trade Commission
--The Securities and Exchange Commission
--The U.S. Civil Service Commission
--The Federal Home Loan Bank Board
The reorganization plan I recommend will extend it to the Tariff Commission.
The Tariff Commission plays a key role in safeguarding the nation's economic vitality. it reviews our commercial policies and studies how these policies affect competition between foreign and domestic products. Periodically, after public investigation, the Commission reports to Congress and the President concerning the effect of imports on our domestic industries and our workers.
The Commission's tasks are demanding and complex. They require skill and careful judgment. Often, the Commission must work under intense time pressure.
The plan I forward today will promote efficient operation of the Tariff Commission by:
--Centralizing and consolidating in a single executive--the Chairman--the purely administrative functions of the Commission;
--Freeing the other Commissioners from these routine burdens so they can devote full time to investigative and advisory responsibilities.
Thus, the plan transfers, from the Commission as a whole to the Chairman of the Commission, these duties:
--Overall management of the Commission's activities;
--Direction and supervision of the employees of the Commission;
--Personnel actions, such as hiring, promotion, salary, transfer, removal of Commission employees; and
--Allocation and use of funds appropriated to the Commission. This plan will allow the nation's businessmen and workers--and indeed every citizen-to reap the benefits of modern and effective government.
As a result of this plan, the Tariff Commission will be managed more efficiently. It is too early, however, to estimate the exact dollar savings that will flow from these improved operations.
This plan was prepared in accordance with Chapter 9 of Title 5 of the United States Code.
After investigation I have found, and I hereby declare, that each reorganization included in the accompanying plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of Title 5.
I urge Congress to permit this reorganization plan to become effective.
