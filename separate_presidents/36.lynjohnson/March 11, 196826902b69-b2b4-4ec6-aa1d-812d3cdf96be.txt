Message to the Congress Transmitting Second Annual Report on Marine Resources and Engineering Development.
To the Congress of the United States:
Science and technology are making the oceans of the world an expanding frontier.
In preparing for the coming decades, we must turn our attention seaward in the quest for fuels, minerals, and food--and for the natural beauty of the seashore to refresh the spirit.
Yet the sea will yield its bounty only in proportion to our vision, our boldness, our determination, and our knowledge.
During the past year we have taken new steps to strengthen the Nation's scientific and technological base for understanding and using the oceans. We have made good progress but much remains to be done in the years ahead.
The National Council on Marine Resources and Engineering Development, chaired by the Vice President, has made significant progress in mobilizing the resources of the Federal Government to meet these challenges. I am pleased to transmit to the Congress the Council's recommendations and annual report.
The Fiscal Year 1969 Budget, which is now before the Congress, includes $516 million for marine science and technology programs. Increased funding is proposed for:

--Broadening education and research in marine sciences, particularly in the Sea Grant and other university programs.

--Speeding up our research for an economical technology for extracting fish protein concentrate for use in the War on Hunger.

--Development of improved ocean buoys to collect accurate and timely data for better prediction of weather and ocean conditions.

--Expanding the Navy's advanced technology needed for work in the deep oceans, and for rescue, search and salvage.
--Constructing a new high-strength cutter for the Ice Patrol and oceanographic research in Arctic and sub-polar areas.

--Preventing and alleviating pollution from spillage of oil and other hazardous ship cargoes.

--Continued mapping of the continental shelf to assist in resource development and other industrial, scientific, and national security purposes.

--Increased research and planning to improve our coastal zone and to promote development of the Great Lakes and of our ports and harbors.

--Application of spacecraft technology in oceanography, and improved observation and prediction of the ocean environment.
Other nations are also seeking to exploit the promise of the sea. We invite and encourage their interest, for the oceans that cover three-fourths of our globe affect the destiny of all mankind. For our part, we will:

--Work to strengthen international law to reaffirm the traditional freedom of the seas.

--Encourage mutual restraint among nations so that the oceans do not become the basis for military conflict.

--Seek international arrangements to insure that ocean resources are harvested in an equitable manner, and in a way that will assure their continued abundance.
Lack of knowledge about the extent and distribution of the living and mineral resources of the sea limits their use by all nations and inhibits sound decisions as to rights of exploitation. I have therefore asked the Secretary of State to explore with other nations their interest in joining together in long-term ocean exploration. Such activities could:

--Expand cooperative efforts by scientists from many nations to penetrate the mysteries of the sea that still lie before us;

--Increase our knowledge of food resources, so that we may use food from the sea more fully to assist in meeting world-wide threats of malnutrition and disease;

--Bring closer the day when the peoples of the world can exploit new sources of minerals and fossil fuels.
While we strive to improve Government programs, we must also recognize the importance of private investment, industrial innovation, and academic talent. We must strengthen cooperation between the public and private sectors.

I am pleased and proud to report that we have made substantial progress during the first full year of our marine science program, dedicated to more effective use of the sea. We shall build on these achievements.
