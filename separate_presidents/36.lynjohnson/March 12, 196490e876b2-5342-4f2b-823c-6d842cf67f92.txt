Statement by the President Upon Approving Bill Authorizing Appropriations for the Coast Guard
I HAVE approved H.R. 9640, which authorizes appropriations of $93,299,000 for the fiscal year 1965 for the procurement of vessels and aircraft and construction of shore and offshore establishments for the Coast Guard.
This authorization is $21,500,000 more than I requested. These additional funds are intended to accelerate a desirable vessel replacement and augmentation program.
However, in view of the urgent necessity for holding Government expenditures to minimum levels consistent with our national objectives, the added authorization should not be used. The essential needs of the Coast Guard can be met and reasonable progress made toward its long-range objectives with an appropriation of $71,799,000--the amount I requested.
I urge the Congress not to appropriate more than that sum.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 9640 is Public Law 88-281 (78 Stat. 162). It was approved by the President on March 11, 1964.
