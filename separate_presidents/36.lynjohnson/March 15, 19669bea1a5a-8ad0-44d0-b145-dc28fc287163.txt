Memorandums on U.S. Participation in International Organizations and Programs.
Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies:

SUBJECT: United States participation in international organizations and programs
I have today sent the attached memorandum directing the Secretary of State to take certain actions which I believe are essential to effective participation by the United States in international organizations.
I expect the heads of all departments and agencies that contribute to the Government's activities in this field to give their full cooperation to the Secretary of State in carrying out my instructions.
This work must receive high priority and the personal attention of the responsible officials in all agencies concerned if this Nation's interest in improving international organizations as instruments for peace and progress is to be fulfilled.

Memorandum for the Secretary of State:

SUBJECT: United States participation in international organizations and programs
The Federal Budget for 1967 contains this statement:
"... we intend to play an increasingly active role in reviewing the program and budgetary proposals of the various international organizations."
The purpose of this memorandum is to set forth what I believe that increasingly active role should be.
No nation has been a greater supporter of the United Nations, its specialized agencies and other international organizations than the United States. We are today a member of some 65 such agencies.
Our continued strong support is necessary and desirable.

--if the world community is to live in peace,

--if we are to cooperate internationally in extending the benefits of modern agriculture, health, and education to the less fortunate, and

--if international problems in such fields as meteorology, telecommunications, and aviation are to be given the joint attention required for their resolution.
The United States has by far been the largest financial contributor to the international organizations.

--Since 1946, we have provided a total of $3.6 billion in direct contributions.

--Since 1956, our annual contributions have grown from $100 million to an estimated $237 million for the next fiscal year, an overall increase of 137 percent.
Moreover, we can expect the programs and budgets of these international agencies to expand further in future years to meet the growing needs of the world community. The United States shall continue to meet its fair share of the financial requirements of these organizations.
If we are to be a constructive influence in helping to strengthen the international agencies so they can meet essential new needs, we must apply to them the same rigorous standards of program performance and budget review that we do to our own Federal programs. Our purpose in this undertaking must be to see that

--future expansion of the activities of the international organizations is governed by the tests of feasibility and reasonableness,

--the programs of the organizations are vigorously scrutinized so that funds are allocated only to high priority projects which we are convinced are in the interests of the international community and of our own country, and

--each international agency operates with a maximum of effectiveness and economy.
To achieve this purpose, we must

--decide what we can best accomplish through multilateral action, as compared to action through our own direct programs,

--clarify the objectives of our membership in each international agency,

--organize ourselves for more effective participation in each organization, and
--insist that the money we spend through international agencies is in our national interest and in the best interest of the world community.
I expect you to continue to direct and coordinate the activities of the U.S. departments and agencies involved in international organization affairs and to instruct our representatives to those organizations. I shall look to you to direct this Government's work in

--reviewing and establishing our long-term policy objectives in each major international organization,

--analyzing and determining the U.S. position on programs and budgetary needs of each organization on a timely and continuing basis, and

--recommending steps to improve the effectiveness of each organization in contributing to the objectives of the world community and the United States.
Ambassador Goldberg has unique responsibilities in a wide range of matters relating to the United Nations system. I shall continue to rely heavily on his advice and counsel.
The heads of other Federal departments and agencies have significant interest in activities of the various international organizations. I expect them to provide you with expert assistance in their specialized fields. In this work, the close cooperation of all agencies is needed to provide the essential unity of our effort.
I expect the Director of the Bureau of the Budget to work with you and other agency heads to help assure that the positions we take on the budgets of international organizations reflect a searching scrutiny of requirements and priorities for the expenditure of funds.
I am sending copies of this memorandum to all department and agency heads.
