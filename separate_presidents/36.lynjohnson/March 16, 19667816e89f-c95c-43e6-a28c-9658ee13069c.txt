Statement by the President Following the Safe Return of the Gemini 8 Astronauts.
THE ADMINISTRATOR of NASA, Mr. James Webb, has informed me that Neil Armstrong and David Scott report they are "A-Okay." All of us are greatly relieved.
They--and those who are joining in their recovery--have shown remarkable courage and poise under stress. They are disappointed that their mission could not continue, but Gemini 8 accomplished the first docking in space--a major step on the course we have set. The information they have acquired will help us to perfect the spacecrafts that will carry us even further.
From their skill and strength we all take heart, knowing that the personal qualities of the astronauts and their colleagues will ultimately prevail in the conquest of space.

We are very proud of them.
Note: The statement was read to the press by Bill D. Moyers, Special Assistant to the President, at approximately 11:40 p.m., after Gemini 8 had splashed down safely in the Pacific following difficulties encountered in flight. The statement was not made public in the form of a White House press release.
