CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF

THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION

TO THE

6234TH TACTICAL FIGHTER WING
The 6234th Tactical Fighter Wing, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against hostile armed forces in Southeast Asia, from 8 April 1965 to 8 April 1966. Throughout this period, the gallantry, professionalism, determination, and esprit de corps consistently demonstrated by the personnel of the 6234th Tactical Fighter Wing were instrumental factors in the successful completion of their assigned mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions. During this period, personnel of the Wing flew 10,797 sorties, totaling 26,165 hours, in the face of fire from modern, sophisticated enemy air defense weaponry, to include surface-to-air missiles. The pilots of the 6234th Tactical Fighter Wing were responsible for the destruction or damage of important military targets in North Vietnam, including airfields, petroleum storage areas, railroads, and missile sites. As a result of the Wing's operation against the infiltration routes used by the North Vietnamese, the support of the hostile forces in South Vietnam was made more difficult and costly. During this period of sustained combat operations, the Wing developed and implemented a new training program and perfected techniques for use in the F4C (Phantom) night operations, which proved exceptionally effective in assuring target destruction and providing security for aircrews . The extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance demonstrated by this unit in the pursuit of its mission are in keeping with the highest standards of performance and traditions of the United States military service and reflect great credit upon the unit and the United States Air Force.
