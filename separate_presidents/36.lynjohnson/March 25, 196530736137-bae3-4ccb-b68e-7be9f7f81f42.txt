Statement to the Cabinet Affirming the Duty of Federal Employees To Respect the Constitutional Rights of Others.
I WANT to make one thing unmistakably and indelibly clear to every department, every agency, every office, and every employee of the Government of the United States.
The Federal Service must never be either the active or passive ally of any who flout the Constitution of the United States.
Regional custom, local tradition, personal prejudice or predilection are no excuse, no justification, no defense in this regard.
Where there is an office or an officer of this Government, there must be equal treatment, equal respect, equal service--and equal support--for all American citizens, regardless of race, or sex, or region, or religion.
Public service is a public trust. I would call upon every Federal civilian employee to remember that he bears a high and solemn trust to the Constitution under which he serves. If all about him--neighbors, friends, fellow townsmen, even family--falter or fail in respect for the constitutional rights of others, the public servant in the service of his country has a duty to protect, defend, and uphold those rights by word and deed.
The Federal Service asks no conformity-no uniformity of thought and no unanimity of vote. But where constitutional rights are concerned, the country can ask no more-and accept no less--than uncompromising devotion to the Constitution itself.
I am asking the heads of each department and agency to communicate this to every office and officer, whatever their rank or position, of the Federal Service and to take all appropriate measures to assure full compliance with the spirit of the law that governs and guards us all.
