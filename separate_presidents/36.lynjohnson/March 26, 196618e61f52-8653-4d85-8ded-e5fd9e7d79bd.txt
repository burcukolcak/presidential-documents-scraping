Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Providing for the Alaska Purchase Centennial, 1967.
IN 1967 the United States will observe the 100th anniversary of its purchase of Alaska from Russia. The bill I have signed today provides for United States participation in the celebration and exhibitions which will take place throughout Alaska.
It is appropriate that all America should participate in this centennial celebration, because the acquisition of the territory which has become the largest State in our Union was a milestone event for our entire country.
The purchase of Alaska was the largest acquisition of land since the Louisiana Purchase. It was the last great land area that the United States was to acquire. When the Stars and Stripes were unfurled over what is now Sitka, Alaska, on October 18, 1867, the destiny of the North American Continent was permanently altered.
The centennial celebration now being planned by the people of Alaska will, through restoration of historic relics, preserve for all time an important part of the American heritage. And the permanent projects which are planned as part of that celebration will contribute to the long-range development of this great and important State.
Note: As enacted, the bill (S. 2614) is Public Law 89-375 (80 Stat. 82).
