Letter to Senator Anderson in Response to Reports of the Federal Reconstruction and Development Planning Commission for Alaska
Dear Clint:
I have reviewed the third and fourth reports of the Federal Reconstruction and Development Planning Commission for Alaska. I am very pleased that you and your associates have accomplished so much in so short a time.
The Commission's action to press forward with a careful study of the geological characteristics of the affected areas seems to me particularly well advised. This information is basic to sound reconstruction planning. I am also happy to hear that the disaster relief program is progressing satisfactorily, and that attention is being given to ways to relieve the financial pressure upon dispossessed homeowners.
It is reassuring but not surprising to me that the people of Alaska have retained the rugged resilience for which they are famous. I have never doubted that with this spirit, they can and will restore Alaska to its former glory and more.
I want particularly to commend the personal contribution you are making to this effort. Your reports clearly indicate that you have committed yourself to this arduous task with the same drive and effectiveness characteristic of your long history of public service. You are rendering a great service to America, to Alaska, and to me.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
