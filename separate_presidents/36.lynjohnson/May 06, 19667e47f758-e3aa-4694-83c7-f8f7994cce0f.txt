Statement by the President on the Demonstration Cities Program on the Occasion of the Nomination of Two Assistant Secretaries of Housing and Urban Development.
I AM particularly hopeful about contributions that both of these fine administrators will bring to the demonstration cities program. This important legislation is now before the Congress and I urge its prompt passage.
The cities program is our first national attempt to apply a bold, forward-looking concept to our urban problems. I believe that the demonstration cities program is going to do more than any other Federal program to help make our cities, small and large, exciting and safe, healthy and inspiring, and places where people can come to live the good life. It is an important and vital addition to our other programs.
I do not expect miracles from this program tomorrow but we must begin to plan intelligently now; we must begin to program the costs now. Our cities are growing far faster than our population as a whole. The challenge of this new urban America is already upon us.
Note: The statement was read by Deputy Press Secretary Robert Fleming at his news conference at 3:45 p.m., on Friday, May 6, 1966, at San Antonio, Texas. Mr. Fleming announced the President's intention to nominate Don Hummel, former mayor of Tucson, Ariz., and former president of the League of Mayors, as Assistant Secretary for Renewal and Housing Assistance, and H. Ralph Taylor of New Haven, Conn., president of Taylor-Hurley Associates, a private consulting organization specializing in urban renewal and development, as Assistant Secretary for Demonstrations and Intergovernmental Relations.
The Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966 was approved by the President on November 3. For his remarks at the signing ceremony, see Item 574.
The statement was not made public in the form of a White House press release.
