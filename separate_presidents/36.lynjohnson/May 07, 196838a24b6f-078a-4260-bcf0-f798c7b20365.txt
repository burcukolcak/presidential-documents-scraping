CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF
THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION
TO THE 20TH TACTICAL RECONNAISSANCE SQUADRON
The 20th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron distinguished itself by displaying extraordinary gallantry in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force in Southeast Asia from 1 April 1966 to 31 December 1966. During this period the 20th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron provided the majority of all United States Air Force daylight photographic intelligence taken over North Vietnam. Flying its combat missions in the face of some of the most effective and sophisticated air defense systems yet experienced by Air Force tactical aircraft, the Squadron contributed materially to the success of the tactical reconnaissance program in Southeast Asia. Through outstanding performance, extraordinary heroism, complete dedication and total teamwork, the Squadron accomplished its mission and maintained a high sortie rate despite extensive combat damage, aircraft losses, and extremely bad weather conditions over targets and recovery airfields. The courage, dedication, high professionalism and superb airmanship displayed by members of this unit are in keeping with the highest standards of performance and reflect great credit upon themselves, the unit and the United States Air Force.
