Letter to the Secretary, HEW, Delegating Authority in Connection With the Worldwide Drug Reaction Monitoring System.
Dear Mr. Secretary:
Pursuant to the authority vested in the President by section 5 (f) of the International Health Research Act of 1960 (PL 86-610) and as President of the United States, I authorize you to perform the functions vested in the President under the provisions of sections 5 (b) and (c) of that Act, as may be required to provide assistance by the United States in the World Health Organization International System to Monitor and Report Adverse Reactions to Drugs.
These delegated functions will be administered by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare within the limits of foreign policy as prescribed by the Secretary of State.
I am pleased that the grant made possible by this delegation of authority will enable the World Health Organization to develop a worldwide early warning system for drugs, similar to the system now in development in the Food and Drug Administration. The World Health Organization's international drug reactions monitoring system will help prevent widespread tragedy of the sort which resulted from the use of thalidomide.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable John W. Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Washington, D.C. 20201]
