Remarks Upon Presenting the Big Brother of the Year Award to the Reverend William F. Graham
DR. GRAHAM, when they told me you were going to receive the Big Brother of the Year Award, I recalled some lines from a hymn that I used to sing as a boy. I believe they are appropriate for the occasion today:

"Throw out the life-line across the dark wave,

There is a brother whom someone should save..."
I'm not going to ask you to sing it, but I'm sure you remember the rest of the words.
Few men have thrown out as many lifelines as Billy Graham. They are lifelines of hope, of faith, of guidance, and of spiritual strength. Today, one of those lifelines is coming back--with a word of thanks from a group of very dedicated Americans.
The Good Book tells us that, "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." In your case, Dr. Graham, it is a rich harvest of satisfaction--and gratitude.
Big Brothers of America are honoring you today for your leadership and influence among the youth of our Nation. I know something about that leadership--and I have seen some of the results of that influence. It is no small thing.
A man's character is molded in his youth. Or, as Wordsworth once wrote: "The child is father of the man."
I do not despair of our youth. I think our young men and women in the Peace Corps, in Vietnam, and in our community action poverty programs, have established themselves as the finest generation in the history of this Nation. But it's reassuring to know there are great men like you who have helped so many of them along the early part of their journey.
