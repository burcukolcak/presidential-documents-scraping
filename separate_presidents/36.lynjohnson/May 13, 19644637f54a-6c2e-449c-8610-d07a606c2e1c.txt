Lyndon B. Johnson
May 13, 1964

Statement by the President following House Action on the International Development Association Bill.
THE House passage of the IDA bill is a major victory for the American people, for an effective foreign policy and for commonsense in our international dealings. This measure is bipartisan in its origins and I congratulate those members of both parties who joined in advancing it a step closer to reality.
It may have taken two tries but a worthwhile cause has won a significant success. We will always continue to try when the cause is just.
Note: for the President's remarks upon signing the International Development Association Act, see Item 361.
