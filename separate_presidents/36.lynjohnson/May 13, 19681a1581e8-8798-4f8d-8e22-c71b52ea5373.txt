Message to the Congress Transmitting First Annual Report on Highway Safety Programs.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit the first annual report on the administration of the Highway Safety Act of 1966.
Each year, more than 50,000 Americans die on our highways. Millions more are injured. Billions of dollars are lost by death, disability, and protracted stays in hospitals.
This report, which covers the period from September 9, 1966, to December 31, 1967, shows that we have begun to take effective action to stem this terrible tide.

During this period

--We established a National Highway Safety Bureau.
--We issued highway safety standards.

--All 50 States received Federal grants-in-aid to help them and local communities to improve their highway safety programs.

--A broad research program has begun, which will provide sound guidelines for future safety standards.

The fight to stop the slaughter on our highways will be long and hard. I hope the Congress will be encouraged by this report to continue its strong support of these vital programs.
