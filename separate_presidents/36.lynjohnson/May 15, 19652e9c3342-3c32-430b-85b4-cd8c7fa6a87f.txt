Further Statement by the President on the OAS Mission to the Dominican Republic.
I CONTINUE to hope that the OAS mission presently in the Dominican Republic will rapidly find a solution that will at the same time assure for the Dominican people the principles of a democratic constitution and a government of national unity able to maintain economic and political stability. If the good offices of the OAS succeed in achieving this solution, the United States Government will render all available assistance toward rapid economic development.
