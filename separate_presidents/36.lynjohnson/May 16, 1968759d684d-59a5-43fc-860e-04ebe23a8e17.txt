CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF

THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION

TO THE

23D TACTICAL AIR SUPPORT SQUADRON
The 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron distinguished itself by extraordinary gallantry during combat operations in Southeast Asia from 15 April 1966 to 20 September 1966. The Squadron played a major role in the development of a new supply route interdiction technique which increased the effectiveness of our efforts and made it more costly and difficult for the enemy to supply his forces. Flying slow, highly vulnerable light aircraft often under extremely bad weather conditions the forward air controllers of the Squadron provided thorough surveillance over enemy supply routes deep in enemy territory and accurately directed highly effective fighter strikes against an important part of the heavily defended enemy supply route. By their courage and selfless dedication, the forward air controllers served as an inspiration to other members and evoked devotion and pride throughout the Squadron. The extraordinary professionalism and heroism displayed by members of this unit in the development and pursuit of its mission are in keeping with the highest standards of performance in the United States Air Force and reflect great credit upon themselves and the Armed Forces of their country.
