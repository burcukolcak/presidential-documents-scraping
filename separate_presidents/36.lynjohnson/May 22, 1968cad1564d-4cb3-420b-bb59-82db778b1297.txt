THE PRESIDENT of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Presidential Unit Citation to
DELTA RIVER PATROL GROUP (TASK GROUP 116.1)
for service as set forth in the following
CITATION:
For exceptionally meritorious and heroic service from 9 May 1966 to 30 June 1967 while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in armed conflict with communist insurgent (Viet Cong) forces in the Mekong Delta region of the Republic of Vietnam. Charged with patrolling the major waterways of the Mekong Delta, Delta River Patrol Group has encountered the enemy daily in an ever-continuing, ever-intensifying struggle for control of this vital area. From the outset of its unprecedented operations, Delta River Patrol Group has met with determined enemy resistance, and has undergone repeated attacks, at point-blank range, from various weapons in the Viet Cong arsenal. Among the battles waged by the Patrol Group are the fiercest engagements ever fought in the Mekong Delta. Delta River Patrol Group has met the enemy on every occasion with unyielding courage and intrepid valor, wresting from the Viet Cong control of the rivers of the region, and regaining for the Vietnamese civilian much of his traditional freedom of movement along the waterways. Ranging the Mekong Delta in the air, on the land, and on the rivers, the officers and men of the Delta River Patrol Group have contributed substantially to the counterinsurgency effort in the Republic of Vietnam. Their gallantry, professionalism, and total dedication to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.
