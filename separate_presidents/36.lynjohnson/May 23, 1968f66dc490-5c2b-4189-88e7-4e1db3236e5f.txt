CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT
CITATION TO THE 36TH TACTICAL FIGHTER SQUADRON
The 36th Tactical Fighter Squadron, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary gallantry in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force in Southeast Asia, from 26 August 1965 to 28 October 1965. During this period, the gallantry, professionalism, determination, and esprit de corps consistently demonstrated by the members of the 36th Tactical Fighter Squadron were instrumental factors in the successful completion of their assigned mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions. As a result of their missions, the enemy's support of his forces in South Vietnam, and his ability to carry out his aggressive tactics against friendly forces were made more difficult and costly. The pilots of the 36th Tactical Fighter Squadron were directly responsible for the destruction or heavy damage to major military targets, which included ammunition dumps, supply routes, and radar sites. The extraordinary heroism displayed by this unit in the pursuit of its mission is in keeping with the highest standards of performance and traditions of the United States. By their gallantry and untiring devotion to duty, the personnel of the 36th Tactical Fighter Squadron reflected great credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.
