Statement by the President Following Passage by the Senate of the Voting Rights Bill.
THE PASSAGE today by the Senate of the voting rights bill I recommended to the Congress on March 15 is triumphant evidence of this Nation's resolve that every citizen must and shall be able to march to a polling place and vote without fear or prejudice or obstruction. By a vote of 77 to 19, the Senate has spoken clearly and firmly.
On behalf of a heartened Nation, I express my appreciation to the Senate leadership, and those who supported them.
Note: For the President's March 15 message to the Congress on the right to vote, see Item 108.
