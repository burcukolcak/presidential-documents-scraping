Statement by the President on the U.S.-Soviet Consular Convention.
WE HAVE just concluded negotiations with the Soviet Union on a consular convention. The agreement will be signed in Moscow on June 1. I have authorized Ambassador Kohler to sign for the U.S. I understand Soviet foreign Minister Gromyko will be signing for the Soviet Union.
This treaty, which I will submit to the Senate for its advice and consent, is a significant step in our continuing efforts to increase contacts and understanding between the .American people and the peoples of the Soviet Union. It will make possible improved consular services in both countries. American citizens visiting the Soviet Union, either as tourists or for business reasons, will have available to them a greater degree of consular protection than ever before. For example, Americans detained in the Soviet Union for any reasons will be assured of access without delay to American consular officials. American businessmen and shipping companies will be able to call on U.S. consular services to assist in representing their interests. And the mechanics for dealing with a whole range of legal problems from complicated questions of inheritance to simply notary services will be considerably eased.
It is my hope that this treaty--the first bilateral treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union--will be a step forward in developing understanding between our two countries--which is so important in the continuing struggle for peace.
