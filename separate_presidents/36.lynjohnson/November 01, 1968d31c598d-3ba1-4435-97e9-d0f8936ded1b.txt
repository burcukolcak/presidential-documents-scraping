Lyndon B. Johnson
November 01, 1968

The President's Message to His Son-In-Law, Charles S. Robb, Congratulating Him on the Birth of His Daughter and on His Promotion to Major.
TWO PROMOTIONS--to father and major--in one week is a happy record of accomplishment. The titles go well together. You are keeping your career in step with your growing family obligations and we are all proud of your progress.
I hope that my announcement of last night will also lift your heart. You and your men have fought gallantly to bring us to this moment of new hope for peace. You will all remain first in our thoughts as we await developments.
The family sends proud and warm congratulations. You are always in our prayers.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
