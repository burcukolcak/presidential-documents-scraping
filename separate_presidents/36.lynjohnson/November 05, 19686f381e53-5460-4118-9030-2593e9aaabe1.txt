Telegram to President-Elect Richard M. Nixon.
[Released November 6, 1968. Dated November 5, 1968]
MY congratulations to you on your success in the Presidential election. Every American, no matter what his political faith, must admire the perseverance and determination you have displayed in achieving your victory.
As you well know, the responsibilities of leadership today are probably heavier than they have ever been before. They are certainly too heavy, and too important, to be also encumbered by narrow partisanship. I hope that our people will turn now from the divisive contentions of the political campaign to a united search for peace and social justice. You can be certain that I shall do everything in my power to make your burden lighter on that day when you assume the responsibilities of President.
With best wishes to you, Pat and your entire family, and with a prayer that you may be strengthened in spirit during the difficult days ahead.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable Richard Nixon, Waldorf Astoria, New York City]
