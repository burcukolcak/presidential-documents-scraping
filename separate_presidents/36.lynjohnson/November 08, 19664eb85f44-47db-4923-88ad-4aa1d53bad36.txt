The President's Remarks Upon Casting His Ballot in Johnson City, Texas.
I AM DELIGHTED to see all of you here at such an early hour.
We had the first two ballots at Johnson City. Mrs. Johnson and I voted the Democratic ticket.
We have excellent weather here and we hope that everybody in Texas will find the opportunity to go and vote today for the candidate and the party of their choice.
We believe there will be a record turnout in the Nation for an off-year election. We have had an exceptional group of men and women serve their country in the Congress.
Today the people will have to judge that record.
I just urge each person to go and consider what is best for his Nation. If he votes for what is best for his country, he will vote for what is best for himself.
Note: The President spoke at 7:45 a.m. at the Pedernales Electric Cooperative headquarters building in Johnson City, Texas, where he voted.
