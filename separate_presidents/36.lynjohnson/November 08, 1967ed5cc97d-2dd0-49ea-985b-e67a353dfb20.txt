Statement by the President Upon Signing Order Enlarging the Federal Council for Science and Technology.
I NEED the coordinated advice and help of every Federal agency with major responsibilities in science and technology. The addition of State, HUD, and DOT members to the Federal Council for Science and Technology will make the Council more effective.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House release announcing the issuance of Executive Order 11381 (3 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs., p. 1538; 32 F.R. 15629; 3 CFR, 1967 Comp., p. 326). The order amended Executive Order 10807 of March 13, 1959 (24 F.R. 1897; 3 CFR, 1959-1963 Comp., p. 329), which established the Council, by adding to its members representatives of the Departments of State, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation. Increasing involvement by these departments with matters of science and technology, the release said, had made desirable their representation on the Council, which is chaired by Dr. Donald F. Hornig, Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (3 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs, p. 1537).
