Telegram to General Eisenhower Wishing Him an Early Recovery.
YOU'RE so much in our thoughts that an expression like this is hardly necessary. Millions of Americans who regard you with such high affection and respect, joined by millions of people throughout the world who share that feeling, are saying, "Get well, Mr. President."

LADY BIRD AND LYNDON B. JOHNSON

[The Honorable Dwight Eisenhower, Fort Gordon Army Hospital, Augusta, Georgia]
Note: The text of the telegram was read by Joseph Laitin, an assistant press secretary, at his news conference at 10:20 a.m. on Tuesday, November 9, 1965, at Austin, Tex. It was not made public in the form of a White House press release.
Mr. Laitin also announced that the President had telephoned Mrs. Eisenhower in Augusta and had instructed Secretary of Defense McNamara to make needed facilities available to members of the former President's family.
General Eisenhower entered the Fort Gordon Army Hospital on November 9 following a mild heart attack. His condition was termed satisfactory, and on November 23 he was transferred to Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington to complete his recovery.
