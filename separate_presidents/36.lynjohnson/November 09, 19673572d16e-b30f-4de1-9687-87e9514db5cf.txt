Statement by the President on the Successful Launching of the First Saturn V Rocket.
THIS MORNING, at exactly 7 a.m. eastern standard time, the whole world could see the awesome sight of the first launch of what is now the largest rocket ever flown. This launching symbolizes the power this Nation is harnessing for the peaceful exploration of space. The successful completion of today's flight has shown that we can launch and bring back safely to earth the spaceship that will take men to the moon. I have conveyed to our space team my congratulations for their splendid performance.
