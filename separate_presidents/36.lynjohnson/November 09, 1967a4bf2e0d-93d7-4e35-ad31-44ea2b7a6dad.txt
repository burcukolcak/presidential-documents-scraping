Proclamation 3820â€”Modifying Proclamation 3279 Adjusting Imports of Petroleum and Petroleum Products

Whereas,pursuant to section 2 of the act of July 1, 1954, as amended (72 Stat. 678) and section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (76 Stat. 877), findings and determinations have been made that adjustments in the imports of crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products were necessary so that such imports would not threaten to impair the national security, such adjustments have been made by Proclamation 3279 (24 F.R. 1781) and modified by Proclamation 3290 (24 F.R. 3527), Proclamation 3328 (24 F.R. 10133), Proclamation 3386 (25 F.R. 13945), Proclamation 3389 (26 F.R. 507, 811), Proclamation 3509 (27 F.R. 11985), Proclamation 3531 (28 F.R. 4077), Proclamation 3541 (28 F.R. 5931), Proclamation 3693 (30 F.R. 15459), Proclamation 3779 (32 F.R. 5919), and Proclamation 3794 (32 F.R. 10547); and
Whereas,it appears that, as represented by the Virgin Islands Government, the development of petrochemical facilities in the Virgin Islands will provide a much needed increase in opportunities for employment of its citizens at job levels which will upgrade the standard of living in the Islands and will make available revenues for the control of air and water pollution, urban beautification, and conservation projects on the Islands, I find and determine that provision should be made to assist the development of petrochemical facilities in the Virgin Islands without impairment of the objectives of Proclamation 3279, as amended:
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that:
1. The last sentence of subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of section 2 of Proclamation 3279, as amended, is amended to read as follows:
Within such maximum level, imports of unfinished oils shall not exceed such percentum of the permissible imports of crude oil and unfinished oils as the Secretary may determine and imports of finished products (other than residual fuel oil to be used as fuel) shall not exceed the level of imports of such products into these districts during the year 1957 except as the Secretary may find it necessary to adjust the 1957 level to accommodate an allocation made pursuant to the last sentence of subparagraph (4) of paragraph (b) of section 3, as amended.
2. A new sentence, reading as follows, is added to subparagraph (4) of paragraph (b) of section 3 of Proclamation 3279, as amended:
In addition the Secretary may make an allocation of imports, not in excess of 15,000 average barrels per day in any particular allocation period, into Districts I-IV of finished products other than residual fuel oil to be used as fuel if the Secretary determines that such action would not impair the accomplishment of the objectives of this proclamation and that such action would serve substantially to promote employment or substantially to upgrade opportunities for employment of Virgin Islanders or substantially to increase revenues received by the Virgin Islands, and the Secretary shall impose such conditions and restrictions upon such allocation as he may deem necessary to assure that the holder of the allocation fulfills commitments made in connection with the making of the allocation.
3. This amendatory proclamation shall take effect as of its date.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-second.
