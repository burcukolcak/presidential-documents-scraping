Statement by the President Upon Directing the Waiver of Permanent Resident Application Fees for Cuban Refugees.
ON NOVEMBER 2, I signed into law legislation which authorizes adjustment of the status of Cuban refugees. This means that refugees who have been in this country for 2 years or more can become permanent U.S. residents.
Today I directed the Attorney General, on humanitarian grounds, to waive the $25 fee that the Immigration and Naturalization Service normally requires for an adjustment of status under the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Cuba requires that the refugees coming to this country turn over to the Cuban Government any worldly assets they own before leaving the country. Most Cuban refugees are able to accumulate very few resources in a 2-year period.
The ability of Cuban refugees to become permanent U.S. residents--without the imposition of any fees--makes individuals eligible for many benefits such as the right to seek a license to practice his or her profession. This new law also places Cuban refugees in a position where they can initiate the process of becoming eligible for U.S. citizenship.
It is estimated that there are currently 123,000 Cuban refugees who are eligible to apply for permanent resident status. More will become eligible at the rate of about 4,000 a month as long as the stream of refugees continues at its present rate.
Note: The bill to adjust the status of Cuban refugees to that of lawful permanent residents of the United States, and for other purposes, approved by the President on November 2, is Public Law 89-732 (80 Stat. 1161).
The statement was released at San Antonio, Texas.
