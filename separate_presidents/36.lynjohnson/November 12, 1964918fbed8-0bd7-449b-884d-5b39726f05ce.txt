Lyndon B. Johnson
November 12, 1964

The President's Toast to Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, President-Elect of Mexico.
Mr. President-elect, Senora:
Mrs. Johnson and I want you to know how proud and how happy we are to have you in our home.
Mexico and the United States share more than a common frontier. We share a set of ideals and a sense of the future. I pray that the mutual respect and friendship which is rooted deep in the conscience of both our countries will grow and endure.
We are friends. We must remain friends.
We honor each other's hopes, and we seek honorable agreements between our nations.
On December 1, Mr. President-elect, you will assume the heavy duties and responsibilities as the leader of your country. I propose a simple toast: to the President-elect of Mexico and his charming wife--may Mexico prosper in peace under your leadership.
Note: The President proposed the toast at a dinner at the LBJ Ranch at Johnson City, Tex.
