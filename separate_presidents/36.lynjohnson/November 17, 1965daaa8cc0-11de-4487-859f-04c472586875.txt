Remarks Upon Receiving the Parents' Magazine Award for Outstanding Service to the Cause of Education
Mr. Hecht, ladies and gentlemen:
I look upon this award that you have just given me as a symbol of victory. Not victory for me or my administration, and not victory even for the Congress--not even victory for educators. But the victory is for American youth and for America itself.
Today, more than ever before, our boys and girls face a life of hope, a life of meaning, and, I think, a life of achievement.
The poor among them can look to opportunity and advancement. The sick among them can look to care. The mentally disturbed among them can now look for some treatment. And all among them can look to an education that will take them as far as their abilities will permit.
And this really is the great victory of our time.
I am proud to have been able to play a part in it. That pride, along with the honor you do me today, I will carry with me to the end of my days. And I am personally very grateful to you for your thoughtfulness and for this token of your recognition.

Thank you.
Note: The President spoke at 1:35 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House. In his opening words he referred to George Hecht, publisher of Parents' Magazine. The medal was presented by Mr. Hecht and Robert Cramer, associate publisher of the magazine. The text of Mr. Hecht's remarks upon presenting the award is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 1, p. 408).
Since 1928 Parents' Magazine has presented medals to distinguished Americans for outstanding service to children and to the cause of education. This was the first time such an award was made to a President of the United States.
