Letter Establishing a Task Force on the Impact of the Cuban Refugee Program.
[Released November 18, 1965. Dated November 17, 1965] Dear Mr. Secretary:
I was pleased to learn from you and Governor Ellington that your visit to Miami accomplished its objective of assuring the community of the continuous concern of the Federal Government about the impact of the Cuban Refugee program. We must continue to place prime emphasis on swift resettlement outside the Miami area. The voluntary agencies, which have been of material assistance in the past, will, I am sure also continue to be of great aid in meeting this new challenge. At the same time, we must make a concerted effort to help the Miami community in a number of ways now, making the fullest possible use of existing Federal programs to maintain and stimulate economic growth in the Miami area and to avoid an undue additional burden on the community as a result of the influx of refugees.
To assure interagency coordination in minimizing the impact on Miami, I am asking you to form a Task Force under your Chairmanship, to include the Departments of State, Labor, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, the Office of Economic Opportunity and Small Business Administration, with the Bureau of the Budget as an observer. You may add such other departments and agencies as you believe will be useful in this effort.
As a result of the refugee program launched in 1961, more than 180,000 refugees have been aided to resettle and integrate in Miami and elsewhere in the United States. Less than 16,000 now require financial assistance in the Miami area. This is a good record of which Americans can be proud. I want our new program to be even better.
Please keep me informed from time to time on your progress in handling this program.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable John W. Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Washington, D.C. 20201]
