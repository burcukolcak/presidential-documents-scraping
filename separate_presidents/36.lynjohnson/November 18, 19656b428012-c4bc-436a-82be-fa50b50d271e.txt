Lyndon B. Johnson
November 18, 1965

Statement by the President on the Death of Henry A. Wallace.
THE DEATH of Henry A. Wallace stills an original American voice. He always spoke his mind--and always from a deep sense of social justice. His views may not always have been popular, but they were always sincere. I considered him a good man and a good public servant. His country will miss him.
Note: The statement was read by Bill D. Moyers, Special Assistant to the President, at his news conference at 4:15 p.m. on Thursday, November 18, 1965, in his office at the White House. It was not made public in the form of a White House press release.
Mr. Wallace served as Secretary of Agriculture 1933-1940, as Vice President of the United States 1941-1945, and as Secretary of Commerce 1945-1946. In 1948 he was a candidate for President of the United States on the Progressive Party ticket.
