Statement by the President in Response to a Progress Report by the Council on Physical Fitness.
THE STRUGGLES to preserve freedom and to advance human hopes and aspirations will not be won by nations whose citizens let themselves grow soft and weak. Despite the ease and convenience of modern life, the crucial tasks of our times demand as much strength and stamina as any in the past.
Physical fitness is, therefore, a matter of national concern. It should also be a matter of personal concern for every citizen. People who spend some leisure time in vigorous and enjoyable activities are far more likely to lead long, productive lives than those who confuse leisure with laziness. More and more, we are coming to recognize that physical fitness in the young is the best insurance against infirmity and enforced idleness in old age.
I am pleased to report that we are responding to this challenge. Our abundance is not producing apathy, and our leisure has not led to lethargy. Instead, there is every evidence that our citizens are employing those gifts to bring about a vast renewal of health, strength, and energy.
The Council on Physical Fitness informs me that there has been remarkable progress toward the goals of providing all Americans with inspiration and opportunity to achieve new levels of physical fitness:
--21 States have strengthened their school physical education requirements.
--44 percent of the schools have increased the amount of time devoted to vigorous games and exercise.
--The number of health and physical education specialists employed in the schools has increased 26.3 percent.
--In 36 States, local school systems have established adult fitness programs, most of them in cooperation with YMCA's and municipal recreation departments.
--Private business has stepped up spending for employee recreation programs to more than $1 billion a year.
--Companies, foundations, and professional and commercial associations have spent approximately $1 million on special fitness projects initiated or suggested by the Council.
--22 States have established Governor's Physical Fitness Councils or Commissions to assist the national effort.
The results of this progress are predictable. Tests administered to thousands of schoolchildren last year showed that today's average boy or girl is as strong and skilled as the superior youngster of only 5 years ago.
These are solid and tangible gains, and they were given new impetus in the last session of Congress. For the first time, the Federal Government has made available to the schools funds which can be used to strengthen health and physical education programs. In many communities, plans already have been drafted to put these funds to work.
All of us can assist in this effort to maintain the vigor and vitality of our free society. Every community ought to come to grips with the problem of increasing the availability of the sports and fitness facilities in our schools--for more hours each day, for more days each year, and for more of the people who live in the neighborhoods around them.
We have made much progress. But we still pay a terrible price each year for neglect of the health and fitness of our people, young and old alike. I hope that in the year ahead all Americans--parents, teachers, and community, government, business, and military leaders--will take further action to assure all of our citizens the opportunity for healthy exercise and active recreation.
