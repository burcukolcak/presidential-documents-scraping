Letter to Dr. James Perkins on Preparations for an International Conference on Education.
Dear Dr. Perkins:
As you know, we are deeply concerned about the role of education in fostering social and economic development throughout the world. That concern underlies the new International Education Act of 1966. It is the reason for the Center for Educational Cooperation which we are planning to establish in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
I believe it is highly important to stimulate deeper mutual understanding among nations of the major education problems facing the world. For this reason, I have asked you and Secretary Gardner to serve as hosts to an International Conference on Education to be held in 1967. It should provide a forum for lively discussion of future goals of educational policy in the participating countries.
Prior to this conference, I hope you will bring together the most knowledgeable educators and administrators from the United States and from other nations to develop a meaningful agenda.
I am grateful to you for undertaking this important project.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Dr. James Perkins, President, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.]
