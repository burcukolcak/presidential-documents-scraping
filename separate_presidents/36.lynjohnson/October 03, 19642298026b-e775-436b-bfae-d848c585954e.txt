Statement by the President on the Effects of Hurricane Hilda.
I HAVE just been informed by Mr. Ed McDermott, Director of the Office of Emergency Planning, that Governor McKeithen of Louisiana, with whom I talked earlier today, has officially requested a Presidential declaration of "major disaster" as a result of Hurricane Hilda.
Surveys by OEP personnel in the State of Louisiana indicate that the damage to property will be severe. In response to the Governor's request, I have declared those areas of Louisiana adversely affected by the hurricane eligible for Federal disaster assistance. I have also directed Mr. McDermott to take all necessary steps to expedite this assistance. I intend to keep in close touch with the situation as the storm moves through the State of Louisiana toward Mississippi.
I am deeply sorry for the lives that have been lost and the people who are suffering such hardship in this unprecedented storm.
