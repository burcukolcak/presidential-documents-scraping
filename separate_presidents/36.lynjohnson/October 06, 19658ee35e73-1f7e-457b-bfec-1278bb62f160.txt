Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report on the International Educational and Cultural Exchange Program.
To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the provisions of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (Public Law 87-256), I am transmitting the annual report on the International Educational and Cultural Exchange Program for the Fiscal Year 1964.
This report suggests something of the experience of life in other lands which students, teachers, professors, lecturers, research scholars, performing artists, athletes and coaches, foreign leaders, writers, judges, doctors--indeed the whole company of the adventurous, the skilled, the searching-have shared with their counterparts abroad, since the exchange programs began two decades ago.
In those twenty years they have become an established part of our commitment to international understanding. That commitment is expressed through Congressional action, through the voluntary efforts of thousands of individual citizens, through our universities and colleges, and through national and local community organizations all across the country.
I commend the report to the thoughtful scrutiny of the Congress.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
