Messages to Mary Martin and the Cast of "Hello Dolly" on Tour in Viet-Nam.
[Released October 9, 1965. Dated October 8, 1965] To Mary Martin and the Cast of "Hello Dolly":
Your journey has been long, but I know that it will be rewarding. I want to thank each of you personally for coming to Vietnam to bring music, magic, and laughter to our sons and husbands who are so far from home.
The footlights may be dimmed after the show but they will not be dimmed in the hearts of the servicemen who see you perform. As your song goes, "For Dolly will never go away again."
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
To Mary Martin .
You are a front-line patriot in the work you are doing. You're making your President and all of Wetherford, Texas, deeply proud of you. Lady Bird and I send you our warm affections.

Note: On October 9 the White House also released the text of the following letter to the President from Gen. William C. Westmoreland, Commander of U.S. Forces in South Viet-Nam:
Dear Mr. President:
Mary Martin and the "Hello Dolly" show have arrived in Vietnam. Before the first curtain at Bien Hoa Airfield, I read to Mary Martin and company, in front of the 5,000 spectator troops, your warm message. Mary and the cast were inspired by your words and the troops join me with appreciation for making this show available in Vietnam to your military forces who are struggling daily to support the ideals that America stands for.
Secretary McNamara has just informed me that your operation was completely successful. His message relaying this good news was also read by me at the opening show today.
Mary, the cast and all the officers and men of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, join me in wishing you a rapid recovery. Our prayers are with you.
Respectfully,
W. C. WESTMORELAND
General, U.S. Army
