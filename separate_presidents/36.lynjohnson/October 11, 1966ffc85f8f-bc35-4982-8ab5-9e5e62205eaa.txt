Message to President Diaz Following Hurricane Damage in Mexico.
I WAS deeply distressed to read on the ticker a few minutes ago of the terrible damage done by hurricane Inez to towns and communities along the coast.
If there is anything that we can do to be helpful, please let me know. Our thoughts are with you and with your people in this stricken zone.

Warmest regards.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[His Excellency President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, Mexico City, Mexico]
