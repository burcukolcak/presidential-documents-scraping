6.Whereas,pursuant to Section 351 (c) (2) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and in accordance with Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, I have determined that the extension, as herein proclaimed, of the remaining increased duties on imports of sheet glass provided for in items 923.31 through 923.77 is necessary to prevent serious injury and is in the national interest:
