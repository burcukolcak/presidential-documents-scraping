Lyndon B. Johnson
October 12, 1967

The President's Telegrams to the Participating Teams on the Final Day of the 1967 World Series.
To the St. Louis Cardinals:
You go to bat today as true champions. If I cannot take sides, I can offer the encouragement of one who knows how it feels to face stiff opposition. May the best team win. You have already won America's pride and hearts. I will be watching with millions of your admirers and look forward to seeing you.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Red Schoendienst, Manager, St. Louis Cardinals, Fenway Park, Boston, Mass.]
To the Boston Red Sox:
My position imposes neutrality on this fateful day. I will try to restrain my natural sympathy for those who prove the polls wrong. Win or lose, you have won a lasting place in history and our hearts. Good luck to you all. I will be watching with the rest of America and look forward to seeing you.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Dick Williams, Manager, Boston Red Sox, Fenway Park, Boston, Mass.]
