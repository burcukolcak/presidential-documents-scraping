Telegram to General Eisenhower on the Occasion of His 75th Birthday.
YOU were expressing sentiments I greatly admire on television last night. It did my heart good to see you on your 75th birthday, so strong in spirit and body--as you are indeed in the hearts of all your countrymen. Lady Bird joins me in warmest congratulations and best wishes.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable Dwight Eisenhower, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]
