Statement by the President Upon Announcing Plans To Employ Medically Trained Veterans in Civilian Health Occupations.
WE MUST NOT waste this valuable manpower resource when the need for trained workers in our hospitals, nursing homes, and other health facilities is so great.
The benefits of this program are twofold: We offer civilian job opportunities or training to these service men and women and we help to meet the demand for the best in medical care and service.
Note: The Presidents statement was made public as part of a White House release which announced the start of "Project Reined" as part of a broader effort begun in August (see Item 345) to help veterans find civilian employment. The announcement added that the aim of the program--developed in cooperation with State and local agencies by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Department of Labor, the Department of Defense, and the Veterans Administration--is to draw upon the 60,000 medically trained men and women discharged yearly from the Armed Forces to provide some of the 300,000 additional health workers needed to furnish optimum patient care. Details of the plan's operation are given in the release, the full text of which is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 3, P. 1444).
