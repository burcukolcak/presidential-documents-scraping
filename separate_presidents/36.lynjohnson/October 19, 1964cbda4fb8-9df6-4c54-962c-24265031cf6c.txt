Lyndon B. Johnson
October 19, 1964

Statement by the President on the Strike at General Motors.
THE General Motors strike is now in its fourth week and is beginning to have an impact upon production and employment in other industries.
Our economy is now in its 44th month of continuous advance.
Failure of the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers to settle their differences at the local plant level will jeopardize the continuous upward thrust of our economy.
On October 5 I said I was pleased that the General Motors Corporation and the Auto Workers had reached an agreement at the national level. In the past 2 weeks significant but slow progress has been made in settling the 130 local plant disputes. The remaining disputes are unquestionably important to the individual workers and the local plant managers, but I sincerely hope that a speedy solution to them is possible.
I urge the officers of the General Motors Corporation and of the Auto Workers Union at the national and local level to reason together, to unite in purpose so that the presently prolonged auto strike can be brought to an end. Such a settlement will be in the best interest of the parties, of the economy, and of the general public.
