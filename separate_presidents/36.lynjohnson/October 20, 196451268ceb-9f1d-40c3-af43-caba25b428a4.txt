Lyndon B. Johnson

Statement by the President on the Death of President Hoover.
MRS. JOHNSON and I want to extend our deep personal sympathy to Herbert Hoover's sons and the other members of his family.
We have lost a wise American, and the world has lost a humanitarian citizen of all mankind. His steadfast leadership served us undaunted through good times and bad-as businessman, provider for the poor and hungry, President, and eider statesman.
He combined the best of our national heritage with broad-gauged understanding of the tumultuous times in which he lived. A man of character and conviction, he was both profound and practical in meeting the many tasks he undertook for his fellow men.
He lived a full and useful life, and we are all deeply in his debt.
We shall miss his thoughtful counsel and kindly spirit. But his unquenchable sense of public responsibility for both our Nation and a troubled world stand as an example that will endure.
Note: The statement was also read by the President to the members of the press in the Theater at the White House. The text of the final paragraph, as read by the President, follows:
"I shall miss his thoughtful counsel and his kindly spirit. Shortly after I assumed the Presidency, after that tragic day in November, he was among the first to volunteer his services and his advice. And they gave me strength and comfort during those trying days. His unquenchable sense of public responsibility for both our Nation and our troubled world will stand as an example that will long endure."
