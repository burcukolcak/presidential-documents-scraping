Statement by the President Following a Meeting With the Panel of Consultants on Foreign Affairs.
I HAD my second meeting this morning with some of the most distinguished men in this country--members of my panel of consultants on foreign affairs. Many of these men--like General Bradley, Mr. Dulles, Mr. McCloy, Mr. Lovett, Mr. Hoffman, and Mr. Acheson--have played great parts in our bipartisan foreign policy over the last 20 years, and I value these opportunities to meet and talk with them frankly.
Part of our business was to discuss the events abroad which have occurred in the last week, but my main purpose was to ask their help in thinking ahead to the great problems which this country will have to face after the coming election, whoever is chosen to go on.
I asked these men to give me their counsel on three important matters:
First: Our relations with Communist countries. We must both defend freedom and advance the prospects of peace.
Second: The affairs of the great Atlantic Community. We intend to move on to greater achievement in a partnership which has gained so much in strength over the last 15 years.
Third: The struggle to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.
I expressed to the panel my own strong sense of urgent purpose in all three of these areas, and I have asked them to continue in working session with Secretary Rusk, Secretary McNamara, and others of my senior advisers within the Government.
I expect to meet again in the weeks ahead with the members of this panel, and I want to take this occasion to express my gratitude for their willingness to serve their country in this way.
Note: For the President's first meeting with the members of the panel see Item 591. The panel was first announced by the President at his news conference of September 9. For a list of the members see Item 563 [5].
The statement was read by the President to members of the press in the White House Theater.
