Statement by the President Upon Signing Joint Resolution Extending Greetings on the Sesquicentennial of Saint Louis University.
I HAVE today signed H.J. Res. 691. The resolution extends greetings and felicitations of the United States Government to Saint Louis University in Saint Louis, Mo., in connection with the 150th anniversary of its founding.
Saint Louis University was founded in 1818 and formally chartered by the General Assembly of Missouri in 1832. It was the first institution of higher learning established west of the Mississippi River. It was founded by members of the Society of Jesus who came to Missouri with the cooperation and aid of the then Secretary of War, John C. Calhoun.
In its century and a half the University has enhanced the prestige of American scholarship and scientific research. During this period it has contributed much to the advancement of learning, the betterment of the professions, and the enrichment of the community.
Among its many graduates have been members of the Cabinet of the President of the United States, Congressmen, Senators, Governors, and other prominent statesmen.
In all--a distinguished record for a distinguished university.
It is with great pleasure that I salute Saint Louis University on its 150th birthday.
Note: As enacted, H.J. Res. 691 is Public Law 90611 (82 Stat. 1201).
