Lyndon B. Johnson
October 22, 1965

Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Providing Grants for Medical Library Services and Facilities.
THE VOLUME of published research in the field of medicine doubles every 10 years. Such a tremendous expansion of knowledge is cumulative; it feeds upon itself--no one can predict when a key discovery will be made which will unlock a whole new chain of knowledge.
This creative process cannot go on unless the results of scientific work are available to practicing physicians and to health workers across the country. The Nation's medical libraries are a vital link between medical education, practice, and research.
Yet in past years we have given too little attention to the problems of collecting and sharing scientific knowledge.
This measure provides long-needed support for our medical libraries.
--It will furnish space and facilities for dealing with the massive body of published information.
--It will advance the processing, storage, and retrieval of material vitally needed by health professionals.
--It will help us to overcome the shortage of personnel trained in science information technology.
Its result, ultimately, will be not only an increase in the growth and spread of scientific knowledge, but a gain in the health and well-being of the American people.
Note: As enacted, the Medical Library Assistance Act of 1965 is Public Law 89-291 (79 Stat. 1059).
