Remarks by Telephone to the Apollo 7 Astronauts Following Their Return.
CAPTAIN SCHIRRA, Mr. Cunningham, and Major Eisele, we here in the Capital and all over this country and the world are so very proud of you this morning. As the eyes of the earth have been open upon you, so have the hopes of the world lifted to you. And in this universal gladness, there is the making of a human partnership where space technology and science will serve as instruments of man's peace in the world. And that is really enough for the United States to excel in space.
And today, despite our triumphs, we have only our fingertip on the latch that could unlock a world of miracles that are practical and profound. And from the blessings that we already hold in our hands we know that neither complacency nor conceit can stay our hand from reaching higher.
So your fellow countrymen are happy to welcome all of you home with that encouragement. We salute the three of you as well as the thousands of your space team, headed by Mr. Webb and others, in great admiration and affection. And when you have finished your debriefings Mrs. Johnson and I hope to receive you where we can talk about your experiences without having to go through the Houston switchboard.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 8:52 a.m. from the Cabinet Room at the White House to Capt. Walter M. Schirra, Jr., R. Walter Cunningham, and Maj. Donn F. Eisele who were aboard their recovery ship, the aircraft carrier Essex. During his remarks he referred to James E. Webb, National Aeronautics and Space Administrator.
