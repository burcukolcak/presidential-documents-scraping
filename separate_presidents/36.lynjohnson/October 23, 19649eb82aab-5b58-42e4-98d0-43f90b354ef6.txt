Recorded Remarks After Further Study of the Report of the Council on Pennsylvania Avenue.
LAST June, shortly after I received the report of the Council on Pennsylvania Avenue, I stated that I would welcome widespread reaction to the Council's proposals. There has been reaction, almost all of it favorable, from many quarters.
During these past months, I have also been able to give the Council's report some further study. Although I recognize that details may require modification, and that any plan such as this must remain flexible, I believe that it should be accepted as a worthy and challenging goal for our Nation's most important street, our Nation's ceremonial drive.
The new building for the Federal Bureau of Investigation is already being designed in accordance with the plan. Private development, which has already begun, should also have the plan as a guide. Every Government agency and department which received and reported on the Council's plan has approved it, some with suggestions for improvement or for further study.
I was particularly impressed by the approval of the National Capital Planning Commission, which really has the major responsibility for the development of the city; by the Commission of Fine Arts; and by the District of Columbia Board of Commissioners. I have likewise been heartened by the enthusiastic response to the plan from so many national and local organizations concerned with the development of our Nation's Capital.
Congress must, of course, be consulted, and must approve the concept of the plan. Meanwhile, however, I believe that we should undertake an immediate study of the best arrangements for implementing the plan and making whatever adjustments and modifications may be necessary.
Note: The President's remarks were video-taped in the Theater at the White House. For his earlier remarks after receiving the Council's report in June, see Item 379 [12].
