Message to the Congress Transmitting 12th Semiannual Report of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
[Released October 23, 1965. Dated October 22, 1965] To the Congress of the United States:
This report to the Congress describes a six month period of impressive accomplishment by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
In a larger sense, however, this report describes America on the move.
The story of man's advancement through the ages is the story of man's victory over the forces of nature. The health and comfort he enjoys, the leisure he possesses, and the abundance of the food he eats are all the result of his unending determination to probe the secrets of the world around him.
In 1958, it was my privilege to introduce the legislation to create the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. I stated then: "I confidently believe that the developments of the Space Age will bring the beginning of the longest and greatest boom of abundance and prosperity in the history of man."

Time is bearing out that belief.
And so I take pleasure in submitting this report to Congress. It chronicles a great and exciting period of accomplishment and foreshadows an even greater one. In commending this record, I also commend the men principally responsible for making it possible. Dr. James Webb and Dr. Hugh Dryden have guided and directed our Nation's space program for nearly five years-and they have a grateful nation in their debt.
