Remarks in Miami Upon Receiving a Book Relating to the Interama Cultural and Trade Center.
Governor, Senator Smathers, Senator Holland, Congressman Fascell:
I think this is a generous thing for you to do, and very thoughtful. I know the deep interest that each of you have taken. I know how you feel about it, Governor.
I am happy that it seems to be on the way to a favorable solution. Claude Pepper talks to me about it every day, and I am going to have a little more time now to do something else. Senator Holland and Senator Smathers have given it top priority on their list.
At the White House the other day we talked to them and asked them to reexplore it. I think this is not only going to be a wonderful thing for the United States Government, and all the Western Hemisphere, but I think it will be a great thing for the progressive and forward-looking State of Florida. For some of you, it is a dream that has come true.
As long as I am in a position to do so, I will try to contribute what I can to what all of you have envisioned as a most worthwhile and public project.
Thank you for this. I will treasure it.
Note: The President spoke at 7:40 p.m. in the Terrace Room at the Dupont Plaza Hotel in Miami, Fla. His opening words referred to Governor Farris Bryant, Senators George A. Smathers and Spessard L. Holland, and Representative Dante B. Fascell, all of Florida.
The book presented to the President contained an illustrated description of "Interama," a cultural and trade center for Latin American countries, under construction in Miami.
