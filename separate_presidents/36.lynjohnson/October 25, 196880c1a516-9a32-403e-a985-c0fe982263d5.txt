Statement by the President Upon Signing Bill Extending the Renegotiation Act of 1951.
I HAVE SIGNED H.R. 17324 which provides a needed extension of the Renegotiation Act of 1951.
Another provision of the bill allows us to carry out fully our obligations under the International Coffee Agreement, 1968. This major commodity agreement is of great significance to the welfare of the less developed world, particularly our neighbors in Latin America.
In addition, title II of the bill deals with the International Antidumping Code, which was one of the agreements concluded as part of the Kennedy Round. In my judgment, title II reasonably safeguards the interests of both the executive and legislative branches. On the one hand, it recognizes the Code and directs the agencies concerned to consider it in administering the Antidumping Act, 1921. On the other hand, it makes clear that any inconsistency or conflict between the Code and the Antidumping Act, 1921, must be resolved in favor of the act.
Note: As enacted, the bill (H.R. 17324), approved on October 24, 1968, is Public Law 90-634 (82 Stat. 1345).
