Message to the 14th UNESCO General Conference Meeting in Paris.
AS YOU review twenty years of achievement and set your course for the future, I send warm greetings to the 14th UNESCO General Conference.
In a world where there is too much want and too much ignorance, you are helping build a better life for all men based on education and on progress in science and the arts.
In a world strained with mistrust and conflict, you are helping to build peace. Your work is founded on the conviction that peace must mean more than the absence of conflict: it must mean the presence of justice and wider opportunities for human fulfillment.

The American people support these goals.
What we achieve together can give reality to our common dream: a worldwide human fraternity, based on mutual understanding and respect--and living in peace.
