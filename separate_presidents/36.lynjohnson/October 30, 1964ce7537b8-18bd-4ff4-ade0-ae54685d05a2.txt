Statement by the President on the Results of a Survey of Compliance With the Civil Rights Act.
GOVERNOR LeRoy Collins, Director of the Community Relations Service, has today informed me of the results of a survey the service has just conducted on compliance with the new Civil Rights Law. These are the first hard facts on compliance we have had since the law was enacted on the 2d of July--and I know the whole Nation will be proud of what they show.
This survey shows widespread compliance. What is most important, it shows the law is being obeyed in those areas where some had predicted there would be massive disobedience.
The survey covered 53 cities of over 50,000 population in the 19 States which do not have their own public accommodations laws.
--In 51 of these cities more than two-thirds of the hotels are desegregated.
--In 46 of these cities more than two-thirds of the motels are desegregated.
--In 50 of these cities more than two-thirds of the chain restaurants are desegregated.
--In 49 of these cities more than two thirds of the theaters are desegregated.
--In 48 of these cities more than twothirds of the sports facilities are desegregated.
--In 50 of these cities more than twothirds of the public parks are desegregated.
--In 52 of these cities more than twothirds of the libraries are desegregated.
Governor Collins tells me that there is still considerable work to be done. The exceptions only serve to point up the basic fact that the general rule is compliance.
This encouraging report vindicates the confidence and trust in our citizens which led to the overwhelming majorities which supported the civil rights bill in both Houses of Congress and in both political parties.
Equally encouraging are the facts regarding the continuing advance in the educational sector:
This fall nearly 100 school districts were desegregated. For the first time in our history there are desegregated institutions of higher education and desegregated public schools at the lower levels in every State of the Union.
The most important factor, however, is that this year for the first time this desegregation was accomplished without violence, without injury, and almost without notice.
There are sections of our country where these changes represent the reversal of generations of customs and practice. But adjustment to the law of the land is being accomplished. And recognition is due those who have provided the leadership that has produced these encouraging developments-public officials, clergymen, educators, businessmen, labor leaders, and other community leaders and countless private citizens have made the difference. Deserving of special note are those Members of Congress who opposed the civil rights bill with all their strength and eloquence while it was being debated and who, once the bill was enacted, urged their constituents and followers to comply with the "law of the land."
As Governor Collins has said, much remains to be done. But I find great encouragement in the results of the first 4 months of operation of the Civil Rights Act. At long last, we as a Nation have faced up to the most persistent and difficult problem this country has known and the prospects for solving it have never been brighter. With conscientious effort, patience, and understanding we will move steadily towards that day when all men are judged by their character and their performance, not by their color, religion, or how they spell their name.
Note: The Civil Rights Act was approved by the President on July 2, 1964 (78 Stat. 241). For the President's remarks upon signing the bill, see Item 446.
