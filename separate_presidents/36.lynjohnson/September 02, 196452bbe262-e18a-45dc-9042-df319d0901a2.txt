Statement by the President Following Senate Passage of the Medicare Bill.
THE VOTE in the Senate was a victory not only for older Americans but for all Americans. The health of every citizen-old and young, rich and poor--is vital to our strength as a nation.
This is the first time either House of Congress has endorsed health care for the aged under the social security system. I congratulate the Senate and hope that the Congress will not long delay final action on this constructive, fair, and wise proposal.
In a free and prosperous society there is no need for any person, especially the elderly, to suffer personal economic disaster and become a tragic burden upon loved ones or the State through major illness when, by prudently setting aside the employers and employees contributions this can be avoided.
