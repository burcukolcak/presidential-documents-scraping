Statement by the President Urging Safe Driving During the Labor Day Weekend.
MILLIONS of Americans will be motoring on our national highways this Labor Day weekend.
Each year the travel on our highways results in needless accident, injury, suffering, and death for growing numbers of people.
Last year alone Americans killed some 47,000 of their fellow citizens in traffic accidents. That is more than 300 times as many Americans as our enemies were able to kill in all the fighting in South Viet-Nam during that same year.
American highways are unsurpassed in the world. Our traffic experts and safety engineers ceaselessly work to increase the pleasure and safety of driving. But, in the last analysis, the only person who can guarantee true driving safety is the safe driver. When you drive this weekend, drive safely.
