Message to the Congress Transmitting a Special Report Following a Joint Review of the United States-Canada Automotive Products Agreement
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit to the Congress a special report on the joint comprehensive review of the United States-Canada Automotive Products Agreement. This review was undertaken by the Governments of the United States and Canada in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. A report to the Congress on the review is required by the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965.
In reviewing the Agreement, both Governments concluded that:

--Considerable progress has been made toward achieving the benefits of a broader United States-Canada market for automotive products. Trade between the two countries in automotive products has greatly expanded, cost economies in production have been realized, and employment in the automotive industries in both countries has increased.

--Not enough experience has been accumulated under the Agreement to recommend changes. Areas of possible improvement were carefully considered and are under further study. Each Government continues to be able at any time to request consultations on any problem arising under the Agreement.
