Letter to Chairman Macy on the Work of Federal Executive Boards and Other Local Associations of Federal Officials.
[Released September 4, 1968. Dated August 29, 1968]
Dear Mr. Chairman:
It is evident from your seventh annual report that the Federal Executive Boards have come of age and are serving as a positive force to improve the quality of American government and life. Their value for serving the public's interest is clearly demonstrated by their contributions to the solution of urban problems, increased economy and efficiency, improved service to the public, and constructive relationships with the community.
There can be, however, no let up in our efforts to come to grips with the many urgent and complex problems facing us today. We must move faster to meet the crises in our cities. We must exercise greater frugality in the use of our resources. We must seek new ways to better serve the public.
I am gratified that you continue to communicate with and encourage other organizations of Federal field officials. The concept of coordinated Federal action on national goals at the local level should be applied wherever possible. By joining together, Federal officials throughout the land can more effectively contribute to the betterment of their community and country.
The Federal Executive Boards have done much and have done it well during the seven years since they were established. The Boards deserve and will have the full support of Federal executives in Washington and in the field. In turn, we will look forward with high expectation to their continued progress.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable John W. Macy, Jr., Chairman, U.S.. Civil Service Commission]
