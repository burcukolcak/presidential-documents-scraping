The President's Message of Greeting for the America Days Celebration in Turku, Finland.
MY FRIENDS of Finland, this celebration of America Days in Turku recalls an occasion 2 years ago when I had the privilege of opening the America Days in Helsinki. I was to make a few remarks, then cut a ribbon to open the celebration. But as the crowd pressed dose I found part of the job done for me: the ceremonial ribbon had snapped in the rush and, as good friends, we had all cut it together.
During our visit to Finland, Mrs. Johnson and I spent one sunny day in Turku. We saw your modern university, the handsome cathedral, and the ancient castle. We heard your mayor describe Turku as a city still small enough for neighbors to know one another. We met many of those neighbors, and we have warm memories of their kindness.
I have asked my old friend and Ambassador at Large, Averell Harriman, to represent the United States in your America Days celebration this year. I know he is going to fall under the spell of Turku's graciousness, just as we did.
I have asked him to tell you how much America esteems the great Finnish people. We here know very well how great they are, for they helped create America itself, and we shall never forget that.

My very best wishes to you all.
Note: Ambassador Harriman delivered the President's message of greeting at the America Days ceremonies sponsored by the Finnish-American Society in Turku. In his message the President referred to his visit to Finland as Vice President in 1963.
The announcement of the message was released at Austin, Tex.
