Statement by the President on Announcing the Selection of Panel Chairmen for the First International Symposium on Water Desalination.
A DEPENDABLE supply of fresh water is an absolute requirement for a world seeking peace and prosperity. Water is needed to grow food, to permit basic development in emerging nations, to allow industrial expansion in others, and to increase living standards for an increasing world population. The Symposium chairmen can lead the way toward new paths of achieving this goal.
The developing technology of water desalting has received enthusiastic and universal support by nations, large and small, again demonstrating that international cooperation is the key to humanity's advancement.
Note: The President's statement was made public as part of a White House release announcing the selection of 19 leading scientists and engineers from 11 nations, the United Nations, UNESCO, and the United States to act as session panel chairmen of the First International Symposium on Water Desalination to be held in Washington October 3-9, 1965. The release also stated that five additional countries would send delegations to the meeting, bringing the total to 63 nations.
