Message to the President of Finland on the Death of Ambassador Sakari Tuomioja.
I LEARNED with great sorrow of the death in Helsinki of Sakari Tuomioja. He served your nation well, and served all nations by his work for the United Nations. He died while laboring once again as United Nations mediator in a tangled and dangerous international dispute. Our people join with yours in mourning a servant of peace, and a friend of us all.
Note: At the time of his death Sakari Tuomioja, Ambassador to Sweden from Finland, was serving as United Nations mediator in the Greek-Turkish dispute over Cyprus.
