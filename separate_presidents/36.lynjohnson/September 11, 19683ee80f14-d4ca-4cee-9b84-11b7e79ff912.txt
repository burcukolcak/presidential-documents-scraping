CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION
TO THE 366TH TACTICAL FIGHTER WING
The 366th Tactical Fighter Wing, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary gallantry while participating in combat operations in Southeast Asia from 23 April 1967 to 1 August 1967. During this period, the members of the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing achieved outstanding success while challenging the North Vietnamese Air Force for aerial supremacy over North Vietnam. Aircrews of the Wing destroyed twelve MIGs and probably destroyed two others during fierce aerial battles. The success of these air battles was due in a great measure to the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Wing personnel who pioneered the use of the externally carried 20 mm Galling gun. Four of their aerial victories were achieved with this unique weapon. In addition to assuring control of the skies over North Vietnam, personnel of the 366th attacked many key targets with great precision destroying vast quantities of supplies needed by the enemy and disrupting his transportation system. The extraordinary heroism displayed by this unit in the pursuit of its mission is in keeping with the highest standards of .performance and traditions of the United States military service. The gallantry and untiring devotion to duty of the personnel of the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing reflect great credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.
