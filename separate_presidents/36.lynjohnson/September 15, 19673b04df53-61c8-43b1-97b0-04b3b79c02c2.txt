The President's Remarks at a News Briefing by Members of the Special Railroad Board on Their Final Recommendations.
SENATOR MORSE and the other members of his board, set up pursuant to a resolution of Congress, have just made a report contemplated by that resolution. Senator Morse will be glad to review the details with you.
Senator Saltonstall, another member of the board, had an engagement he could not cancel in Massachusetts today. He had the chairman speak for him in this connection.
We have a unanimous report from the board. This is one of the finest products that any board has produced. I am very proud of the public service that has been rendered by each of these men. They have given willingly and patriotically of their time to serve the public interest.

The President, on behalf of all the people of this country, is proud of their product. We are very grateful.
