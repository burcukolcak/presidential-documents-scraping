Statement by the President Upon Signing the Military Construction Authorization Act.
I HAVE today signed into law the Military Construction Authorization Act for fiscal year 1966.
Few measures I have signed this year have so refreshed my faith in our institutions of government. Men of reason and good will in the legislative and executive branches have fashioned an acceptable bill, one that will strengthen the national security and contribute to the defense of freedom.
Less than a month ago I returned a similar measure to the Congress without my approval, because I felt that one of its provisions was repugnant to the Constitution. That provision required a lengthy waiting period, limited to one period of the year, before an economy could be achieved by the closing, or substantial reduction in mission, of a military base.
In my message of disapproval I said, "I do not mean to imply that a reasonable reporting provision, consistent with the legislative powers of the Congress, would warrant a veto."
The Congress has speedily enacted a new bill, containing such a reasonable reporting provision. I am happy to approve the bill, and I congratulate the Members of the Congress on the promptness with which they adopted this perfected measure.
Note: As enacted, the Military Construction Authorization Act of 1966 is Public Law 89-188 (79 Stat. 793).
For the President's veto of a similar measure on August 21, 1965, see Item 440.
