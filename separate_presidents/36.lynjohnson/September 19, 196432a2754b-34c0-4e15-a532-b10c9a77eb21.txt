Lyndon B. Johnson
September 19, 1964

Statement by the President on the Death of Professor J. Frank Dobie.
OUR NATION has lost one of our most gifted, colorful, and constructive citizens with the passing of J. Frank Dobie. His life work of re-creating our rich regional heritage of the conquistadores and cowboys restored for future generations a treasure that might otherwise have been lost.
Mrs. Johnson and I cherished for many years the candor and compassion of Professor Dobie. All of us can be grateful that only 5 days before he died Professor Dobie received the Medal of Freedom, our Nation's highest civil award, in recognition of the contribution he made as a writer and teacher to the enrichment of our American heritage.
Note: For Dr. Dobie's citation at the Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremonies, see Item 568.
