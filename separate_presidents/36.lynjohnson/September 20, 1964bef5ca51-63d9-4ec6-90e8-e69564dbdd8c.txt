Message to Prime Minister Olivier on the Occasion of the Independence of Malta.
[ Released September 20, 1964. Dated September 18, 1964 ]
Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
Congratulations and best wishes on the occasion of Malta's independence.
The establishment of Malta as an independent state is a tribute to you, the British Government, and the people of Malta. The United States has been deeply impressed by the leadership and courage you have provided in your country's efforts to achieve its independence and secure its freedom.
Malta is well known to us. We have welcomed thousands of Maltese to our shores. Our mariners have been warmly received by your islands since the days of our own independence. In the field of science, the discovery of the undulant fever germ by Sir Themistocles Zammit epitomizes the development of Malta's many skills. Malta's unflinching steadfastness during World War II symbolized the strength of the Maltese throughout an epic history. We in the United States look forward to seeing the friendly ties already established between us grow stronger in the years ahead.
I am happy to have Mr. Richard W. Reuter, the Director of the Food for Peace Program, as my representative and Special Ambassador at the independence ceremonies. He is a distinguished United States public servant who has worked closely with me, and he has a particular sympathy for the great principles of freedom for which you stand. Also representing me will be Mr. Joseph Calleja, the Director of the Maltese Information Center in Detroit, Michigan.
I am confident that Malta's role as an independent member of the community of nations will be bright and constructive. We look forward to working together with you and your government and your people in the great causes of our time--the promotion of peace, freedom, and democracy.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Right Honorable Dr. Giorgio Borg Olivier, Prime Minister, Valletta, Malta]
