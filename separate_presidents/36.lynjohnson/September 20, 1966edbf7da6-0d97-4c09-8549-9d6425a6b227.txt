Message to the Congress Transmitting 10th Annual Report on the Trade Agreements Program.
To the Congress of the United States:
This is the tenth annual report on the Trade Agreements Program, as required by section 402(a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. It covers calendar year 1965.
World trade in 1965 surpassed all previous levels, enriching the lives of peoples around the globe. Record levels of United States foreign trade contributed greatly to this advance, and the American people shared fully in its benefits.
However, the successes of 1965 also served to dramatize the vast unrealized potential of the world market and the importance of moving forward with the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations, the great multilateral endeavor to generate more rapid growth in trade. Recently, the pace of these talks has intensified. The major participants have shown renewed determination to conclude an agreement. The United States will continue to exert every effort to assure that these negotiations yield extensive reductions in restraints on trade in all classes of goods, including agricultural products.
The steady growth and freer flow of world trade are essential to full prosperity at home, economic growth and stability in the industrialized countries, and progress in the developing world. We shall do everything in our power to build in future years on the substantial progress in these directions achieved in 1965.
