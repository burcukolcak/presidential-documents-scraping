Memorandum Concerning Government Cooperation in the United Community Campaigns of America
Memorandum to Heads of Departments and Agencies:
The Honorable Robert S. McNamara, Secretary of Defense, will again serve as Vice Chairman for the Federal Government in regard to United Community Campaigns of America. I am confident that you will give him your full cooperation in this important humanitarian effort.
We can be proud of the performance of Federal workers who last fall helped these United Campaigns attain a record total of $625 million. It is my hope that they will continue this fine performance.
United Campaigns offer us the opportunity to contribute to a wide variety of philanthropic organizations through a single appeal.
Among the more than 30,000 voluntary national, state and local health and welfare agencies which have joined in these unified appeals are family service organizations, child care agencies, youth programs, physical and mental health organizations, and programs for special services to the aging.
Moreover, we have a special concern this year for the vital services being given by the Red Cross and USO in Viet Nam and to our military personnel and their dependents all over the world.
The amount required to meet the needs of the many beneficiaries of a United Fund drive is great. But the Federal plan of voluntary fund raising provides for the effective solicitation of all employees, through the acceptance of equitable unit goals, and permits the use of keyman collection for those who wish to make contributions on an installment basis.
In the National Capital Area and other communities where a Combined Federal Campaign will be held this year, Federal workers will have the opportunity to give to their local United Fund through that facility.
