Lyndon B. Johnson
September 26, 1967

Remarks Recorded in Connection With the 1968 United Community Campaigns of America.
I SPEAK to you on behalf of America's largest philanthropic effort--the United Community Campaigns of America.
Whether it's called the United Fund, or the Community Chest, or the United Crusade, or the United Givers Fund--it offers every American a personal opportunity to help shape a better America.
The United Way does more than help the poor. It helps our troubled youngsters, our homeless children, the lonely aged, disaster victims, members of the Armed Forces and their families.
Help from the United Way comes from those who know their communities best. It comes from you and your neighbor.
This is, I think, the commonsense way to help others. When you give to your United Fund or to your Community Chest, your hometown becomes a much better place for everyone's family--including your own family.
So, I earnestly ask each of you to please give generously.
Note: The President's remarks were recorded in the Theater at the White House at 1:33 p.m. on July 27, 1967, for release on September 26.
