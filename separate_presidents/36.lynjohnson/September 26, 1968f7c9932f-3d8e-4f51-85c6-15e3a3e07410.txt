Lyndon B. Johnson
September 26, 1968

Telegram to the Co-Chairmen of the Campaign Organizing Workshop of the Texas Democratic Party.
I SALUTE YOU, my dear friends, and the fine men and women who are working with you to make Texas a Hubert Humphrey State.
No responsible Democrat can sit out this crucial election. It is the task of all of us to see that this Nation has strong, compassionate, and effective leadership.
It is our job--yours and mine--to make sure that the programs we have worked so hard to begin--achieve their full promise for America.

It is our job to continue building a peaceful world, where even the smallest and weakest nations are free to chart their own destinies.
America needs Hubert Humphrey and Ed Muskie. And I am proud that Texas is leading the way to assure their victory in November.
My best wishes for a most productive workshop.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
