Statement About the Death of Arthur Krock
ARTHUR KROCK's "Sixty Years on the Firing Line" marked him as a journalist of surpassing judgment and integrity. As both a correspondent and commentator he brought a sense of perspective and understanding to public affairs that was valued by all who knew him and won for him the highest awards of his profession. One of his awards was the Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor, which I had the privilege of presenting to him in 1970.
Mrs. Nixon and I join the Nation in mourning the death of one of America's greatest journalists and one of her finest sons.
NOTE: Mr. Krock, 86, died in Washington, D.C., on April 11, 1974. He was with the New York Times from 1927 until his retirement in 1966.
The statement was issued at Key Biscayne, Fla.
