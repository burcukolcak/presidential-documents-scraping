Statement Announcing Changes in Trade and Travel Restrictions With the People's Republic of China
IN MY second annual Foreign Policy Report to the Congress on February 25, 1971, I wrote, "In the coming year I will carefully examine what further steps we might take to create broader opportunities for contacts between the Chinese and American peoples, and how we might remove needless obstacles to the realization of these opportunities."
I asked the Under Secretaries Committee of the National Security Council to make appropriate recommendations to bring this, about.
After reviewing the resulting study and recommendations, I decided on the following actions, none of which requires new legislation or negotiations with the People's Republic of China:
--The United States is prepared to expedite visas for visitors or groups of visitors from the People's Republic of China to the United States.
--U.S. currency controls are to be relaxed to permit the use of dollars by the People's Republic of China.

--Restrictions are to be ended on American oil companies providing fuel to ships or aircraft proceeding to and from China except on Chinese-owned or Chinese-chartered carriers bound to or from North Vietnam, North Korea, or Cuba.

--U.S. vessels or aircraft may now carry Chinese cargoes between non-Chinese ports and U.S.-owned foreign flag carriers may call at Chinese ports.

--I have asked for a list of items of a nonstrategic nature which can be placed under general license for direct export to the People's Republic of China. Following my review and approval of specific items on this list, direct imports of designated items from China will then also be authorized.
After due consideration of the results of these changes in our trade and travel restrictions, I will consider what additional steps might be taken.
Implementing regulations will be announced by the Department of State and other interested agencies.
Note: On June 10, 1971, the White House released an announcement and the text of a statement by White House Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler on the termination of trade controls on nonstrategic items for export to and on imports from the People's Republic of China. The texts of both are printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 7, pp. 890 and 891).
On the same day, the White House released the transcript of a news briefing on relaxation of trade controls by Winthrop G. Brown, Deputy Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and Robert B. Wright, Director, Office of East-West Trade, Department of State; and Ernest B. Johnston, Jr., National Security Council Staff.
