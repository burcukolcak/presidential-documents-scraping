SEC. 1. The rates of monthly basic pay for members of the uniformed services within each pay grade are adjusted upwards as set forth in the following tables:




SEC. 2. (a) A person who became entitled after December 31, 1969, but before the date of enactment of the Federal Employees Salary Act of 1970, to payment for items such as lump-sum leave, reenlistment and variable reenlistment bonus, continuation pay, any type of separation pay, or six months death gratuity, shall not be entitled to any increase in any such payment by virtue of this order.
