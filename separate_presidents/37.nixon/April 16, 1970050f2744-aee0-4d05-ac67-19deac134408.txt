Message to Ambassador Gerard C. Smith, Chief of the United States Delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in Vienna.
AS YOU and your colleagues resume the effort begun at Helsinki to achieve the limitation of strategic armaments, I reaffirm the statements in my message to you last November. I expressed then--and I express now--the hope that an agreement can be reached on the limitation and eventual reduction of strategic arsenals with proper recognition of the legitimate security interests of the United States and the Soviet Union and of third countries. Your current instructions will enable you to move from general explorations to a discussion of more specific proposals toward these ends.
In proceeding with this momentous task, you will have as your guide the detailed and comprehensive studies conducted within our Government since the first day this administration took office. You know of my firm commitment to the search for an early, equitable, verifiable agreement. You have authority to approach the issues in the most comprehensive manner.
The effort to limit strategic armaments remains an integral part of our work for a lasting peace, a peace from which all peoples will benefit.
It is my hope and expectation that your Soviet colleagues will carry into the Vienna meetings the same determination to bring about a mutually acceptable agreement.
It is appropriate that your opening session is taking place in a building in which the negotiations for the Austrian State Treaty were successfully completed 15 years ago. The United States is grateful to Austria for the arrangements which have been made for this conference.
