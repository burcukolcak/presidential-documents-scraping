Memorandum on Employment of the Handicapped
To Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Subject:Policy for Federal Employment of the Handicapped
It is the policy of this Administration, in staffing the Federal service, to give full consideration to the employment and selective placement of the handicapped.
Administrations of both parties, since World War II, have set examples of national leadership in opening the Government's doors to more than one-quarter million citizens who, though handicapped, have nonetheless been occupationally qualified. Today throughout the economy we find general acceptance of the reminder: "Hire the Handicapped-It's Good Business."
I have personally observed the mutual benefits that derive from hiring the handicapped, and I want this "good business" to continue and prosper.
Therefore, I ask each of you to make a commitment to removing any remaining barriers to the Federal employment of
--the physically impaired who are not occupationally handicapped when assigned to the right jobs.
--the mentally restored whose only handicap is that they once suffered an emotional illness.
--the mentally retarded who can demonstrate ability to perform the simple and routine tasks that need doing in all organizations, regardless of size.
The Civil Service Commission will provide leadership and direction for the overall Federal effort in carrying out this policy.
I am confident that you will give this policy and the Commission your earnest support.
RICHARD NIXON
