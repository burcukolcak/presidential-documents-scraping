Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Plan for United States Participation in the World Weather Program.
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with Senate Concurrent Resolution 67 of the 90th Congress, I am forwarding to you the second Annual Plan for United States' Participation in the World Weather Program. This report reviews the progress made during the past year and describes the activities planned by the Federal agencies for the coming fiscal year.
Progress in the World Weather Program has been significant. Of particular import is that, through the United States' effort in space, we have seen the development and testing of an instrument which is capable of measuring globally from a satellite the temperature distribution of our total atmosphere. This represents a giant stride forward. It holds promise of providing data from over the oceans and other remote areas, heretofore unavailable, which are essential for providing weather predictions to our people.
On another front, it is most encouraging to note the progress in international cooperation in this area. Nations have joined hands in moving forward with a program to assist developing countries in improving their meteorological services. And the nations of the world are coming together this month to decide on the next major steps in the research activities of the World Weather Program.
The World Weather Program focuses on the important problem of understanding our global atmosphere. Whether we are attempting to assess the impact of pollutants on the quality of our environment, or trying to improve the accuracy and time range of weather prediction, these activities are vital to the people of the United States--to their safety and to their economic well-being.
