Letter to the Chairman, President's Commission for the Observance of Human Rights Year 1968, on the Commission's Final Report
Dear Governor Harriman:1
I have received the Final Report of the President's Commission for the Observance of Human Rights Year 1968, and I thank you for it. You, the other members of the Commission, and those who worked on its staff are to be commended for your diligent and consistent effort in response to the request of the United Nations General Assembly that its members commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
1Mr. Harriman served as Governor of New York from 1955 to 1959.
Your concern that Americans speak as one when they seek to promote the cause of human rights is fully shared by this Administration. We wholeheartedly agree with your statement that our moral position in the world reflects our devotion to these fundamental principles.
Our government and, I am confident, our people remain committed to continuing action for human rights. I commend you for the many contributions you have made to this vital process.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable W. Averell Harriman, Chairman, The President's Commission for the Observance of Human Rights Year 1968, Department of State, Washington, D.C. 20520]
