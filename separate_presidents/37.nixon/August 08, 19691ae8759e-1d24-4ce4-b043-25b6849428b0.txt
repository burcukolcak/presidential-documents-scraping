Memorandum on Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government
Memorandum for Heads of Departments and Agencies
In my memorandum to you of March 28, 1969, I reaffirmed the Government's policy of providing equality of opportunity for all citizens in Federal employment. At the same time I directed the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to review present efforts in the Government to achieve equal employment opportunity and give me recommendations for desirable policy and program changes.
The Civil Service Commission has given me its report. Because I believe the report and its recommendations are of vital importance to the Government, I am attaching a copy for your personal review. I completely endorse the new program directions which it outlines, and I look for positive results from these new efforts.
No more serious task challenges our nation domestically than the achievement of equality of opportunity for all our citizens in every aspect of their lives regardless of their race, color, religion, national origin or sex. This includes the opportunity for all persons with full recognition of their dignity as individuals, to seek and to achieve their highest potential and productivity in employment situations. Discrimination of any kind based on factors not relevant to job performance must be eradicated completely from Federal employment. In addition, we must, through positive action, make it possible for our citizens to compete on a truly equal and fair basis for employment and to qualify for advancement within the Federal service. We must search for new ways to provide the necessary encouragement, assistance and training opportunities, where appropriate, so that all employees may utilize their capabilities to the fullest extent in meeting the manpower needs of Federal agencies.
There are several points in Chairman Hampton's report which I want to emphasize:
--Assuring equal employment opportunity in a Federal department or agency is the responsibility of the organization's head. It must have his continuing high priority attention and that of all agency executives.
--Equal employment opportunity must become an integral part of the day-to-day management of Federal agencies and interwoven with every action which has an effect on employees. This is the road to true equal employment opportunity.
--While we must continue to search out qualified personnel from all segments of our population, we must now assure the best possible utilization of the skills and potential of the present work force. Employees should have the opportunity to the fullest extent practicable to improve their skills so they may qualify for advancement. Those who have potential to serve at the supervisory level and above should be identified and given the opportunity to develop to their fullest capability. Programs are underway and new efforts are being developed to achieve this end.
--Special efforts must be made to assure that opportunities in the Federal Government at the professional levels are made known to men and women of all races, religions and ethnic backgrounds so that positions of leadership in the future can be assumed by persons from all segments of our population.
--Every possible step must be taken by agency heads to make sure that each manager and supervisor in the Government understands and implements the objective of equal employment opportunity for all Americans. Our supervisors' performance must in every way support equality of opportunity for all employees.
--In addition to assuring equal employment opportunity for all persons, the Government, as a responsible employer, must do its part along with other employers to provide special employment and training programs to those who are economically or educationally disadvantaged. We must hold out a helping hand and imaginatively use the facilities of the Government to prepare such persons for useful and productive employment.
I have asked the Civil Service Commission to work closely with agencies and other interested organizations in the implementation of these program directions and to keep me informed of progress. Interagency consultation and coordination will hasten our progress and assure common understanding of our goals and the Commission will have the direct support of my staff in this effort. I request that you and your staffs cooperate fully in this urgent undertaking and move forward energetically in the direction outlined in the Civil Service Commission's report.
At the same time, I have issued a new Executive Order[11478] on equal employment opportunity in the Federal Government. This Order clearly states the policy of this Administration in this critical area and demonstrates the continuing Federal commitment to equal employment opportunity.
I look forward to receiving the Commission's progress reports on a regular basis. They will have my personal attention.
I suggest that every supervisor have an opportunity to see this memorandum.
