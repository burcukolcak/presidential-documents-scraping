Statement About Rescission of Price Increases by Automobile Manufacturers
IN announcing that their previously announced price increases for 1972 models would be rescinded, the Nation's automobile manufacturers have acted with a laudable respect for the national interest and with a high sense of responsibility.

This action demonstrates dramatically a spirit of voluntary cooperation in making the wage-price freeze work. With this spirit, and with all Americans pulling together, we can break the back of inflation and set the Nation securely on the path of a new prosperity.
