Statement About the Death of Neil H. McElroy
WITH the death of Neil H. McElroy, the United States has lost an outstanding citizen, the American people have lost a dedicated public servant, and I have lost a valued friend and associate.
Neil McElroy served his country in many ways. He was a highly successful executive, an active civic and community leader, a strong and resourceful Secretary of Defense in the Eisenhower Administration, and--most recently--a very effective chairman for the President's Commission on School Finance.
To all of his undertakings, he brought the gifts of high character and keen intelligence. Mrs. Nixon and I are deeply grateful for his life and deeply saddened by his death. We extend our profound sympathy to the members of his family.
Note: Mr. McElroy, 68, died of cancer at Holmes Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, on November 30, 1972. He joined The Procter & Gamble Company in 1925 and served as chairman of the board 1959-71, and as chairman of the executive committee of the board 1971-72. He was Secretary of Defense 1957-59, and Chairman of the President's Commission on School Finance 1970-72.
The statement was released at Key Biscayne, Fla.
Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Elliot L. Richardson represented the President at funeral services in Cincinnati on December 3, and delivered a letter from the President to the McElroy family.
