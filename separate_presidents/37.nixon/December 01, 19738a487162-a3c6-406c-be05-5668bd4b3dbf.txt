Statement on the Death of David Ben-Gurion.
IT WAS with the deepest sorrow that I learned of the death of David Ben-Gurion.
With courage, love, and determination, David Ben-Gurion worked to establish the modern State of Israel. As we move forward in the struggle for justice and peace, we take from the example of his life increased conviction that cause will triumph.
The people of America join with the people of Israel in mourning the passing of a gallant man. As we shared his ideals and hopes, not only for Israel but for all mankind, so we share in their loss.
Note: Mr. Ben-Gurion, 87, died in Tel Aviv, Israel.
He was the first Prime Minister of the modern State of Israel, serving from 1948 to 1953 and from 1955 to 1963.
Secretary of Agriculture Earl L. Butz represented the 'President at the funeral services in Jerusalem on Monday, December 3, 1973.
