Memorandum Requesting Support for the Minority Business Enterprise Program
Memorandum to Heads of Departments and Agencies
SUBJECT:Federal Procurement and Minority Business Enterprise
Minority business enterprise is a major concern of this Administration. For that reason, on March 5, 1969, I established by Executive Order the Office of Minority Business Enterprise in the Department of Commerce to coordinate the efforts and resources of Federal departments and agencies and private enterprise in this field.
One of the most important ways to promote this effort is to develop a program which will increase the involvement of minority group contractors in the multibillion dollar Federal procurement program. The Office of Minority Business Enterprise, the Small Business Administration, and a Federal Task Force on Procurement--under the leadership of Robert L. Kunzig, Administrator of General Services--are working closely with members of my staff to develop such a program.
Leonard Garment, my Special Consultant, and Robert J. Brown, my Special Assistant, will assist in the development of that program, keep me informed of progress, and make such recommendations as they feel are necessary.
I request that during the period of program development, all departments and agencies provide to the Office of Minority Business Enterprise and the Small Business Administration full support in the following ways:
--Provide procurement opportunities.
--Supply management and technical experts.
--Help to set goals to measure progress of the efforts being made.
--Name a representative of your department or agency to pursue these efforts. This program has high priority on this Administration's agenda. I trust that all of you will give it your best attention and effort.
