Christmas Message to Hospitalized Veterans.
MY FAMILY joins me in wishing all our hospitalized veterans and those who care for them a very happy Christmas.
May this season of giving be particularly satisfying for you who have given so much to all of us. May you derive comfort and courage from your very special gift to the American people: your sacrifices in the cause of peace and freedom.
It is a gift that we can never fully return. But because of it, we are free to worship the Prince of Peace in this holy season; and we are nearer to the peace on earth we seek.
Our thoughts will be with you--as will our prayers and our enduring thanks.
