Statement Urging the Establishment of the Position of Under Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs.
THE UNITED STATES has long had a special concern for its relations with the other nations of the Western Hemisphere. Our relationship has been forged by ties of geography, history, and common interests and aspirations. It is embodied in the web of treaties and commitments that constitute the inter-American system. Above all, the nations of the hemisphere share a common commitment to improve the quality of life for all the peoples of this hemisphere.
To meet the pressing needs of the decade ahead, I have proposed that the nations of the inter-American system develop--in a more mature partnership--a program of action for progress in the 1970's. We have made a start, and are continuing a process of consultation with our hemisphere neighbors, in the crucial areas of expanding trade and accelerating development.
To fulfill more effectively our commitment in this new partnership program will require a significant reorganization and upgrading of our governmental structure dealing with Western Hemisphere affairs. The proposal which the Secretary of State submitted to the Congress on December 20 to establish an Under Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs is a key element of that effort. It is an important first step designed to:
--produce more effective and efficient implementation of new policy approaches in the Western Hemisphere. The new Under Secretary will be given authority to coordinate all U.S. Government activities in the Western Hemisphere.
--create one place in the U.S. Government where other hemisphere nations can come to discuss their problems. The new Under Secretary will have the personal authority and responsibility to speed decisions and be responsive to the concerns of our hemisphere partners.
--signify to the nations of the hemisphere the special importance we attach to our relations with them. The new Under Secretary will have the stature and authority to symbolize our commitment to the special Western Hemisphere relationship.
The proposal to establish an Under Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs has received wide approval in the hemisphere. It is a step which is long overdue. Early passage of the proposed amendment by the Congress will help to demonstrate our good faith and serious intentions in the quest for a better life for the peoples of the hemisphere.
