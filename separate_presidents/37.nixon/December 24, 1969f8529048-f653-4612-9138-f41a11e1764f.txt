5.Whereas,pursuant to Section 301(b) (1) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1901(b) (1)), the Tariff Commission, on July 2, 1969, instituted an investigation, the report to the President on which is to be made not later than December 27, 1969, to determine whether glass of the kinds provided for in items 541.11 through 541.31, 542.11 through 542.98, 543.11 through 543.69, 544.31, and 544.32 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States are, as a result in major part of concessions granted thereon under trade agreements, being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to the domestic industry producing like or directly competitive products;
6.Whereas,in relation to the possible further extension of such remaining increased duties, I have taken into account advice received from the Tariff Commission on December 1, 1969, and the advice of the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor in accordance with Section 351(c) (2) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, recommendations of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations in accordance with Sections 3 (b), 3(j), and 5(c) of Executive Order No. 11075 of January 15, 1963 (48 CFR 1.3 (b), 1.3(j), and 1.5(c)), and advice of other interested agencies of the Government; and

Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including Section 351(c) (2) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, do proclaim that the remaining increased rates of duty on imports of sheet glass provided for in items 923.31 through 923.77 in Subpart A of Part 2 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States are extended to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the period beginning on January 1, 1970, and ending at the close of March 31, 1970, unless the President proclaims otherwise with respect to any such glass, pursuant to Section 351(c) (2) or (a) (1) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, following receipt by the President of the report of the Tariff Commission referred to in the fifth recital.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this 24th day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fourth.
