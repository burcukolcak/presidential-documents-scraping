Statement About the Death of General Emmett O'Donnell, Jr
ACROSS the Nation and around the world, Americans of all ages and every walk of life mourn the death of one of the greatest friends they ever had and one of this country's foremost patriots.
His unmatched warmth, human compassion, and consideration for the needs of others earned General Rosy O'Donnell the affection and respect of all who knew him. His courage in combat, his professional excellence and dedication, and his continuing concern long after his retirement for those in uniform won him a special place in the annals of our military history.
He was as sensitive as he was strong, and he never lacked the ability to lift the spirits of others and make them forget their sorrows. His death is a loss for each of us, but his life was our enduring gain, and a gain for the country he loved and served with such tireless energy and devotion.
My thoughts are particularly with his family, and we all pray that they may be strengthened by their remembrance of him--just as America will be for many years to come.
Note: General O'Donnell, 65, died of a heart attack in his home in McLean, Va., on December 26, 1971. General O'Donnell was Commander in Chief of the Pacific Air Forces, Hawaii, 1959-63. He retired from active duty in 1963, and was president of United Service Organizations, Inc., from 1964 until his death.
The statement was released at Key Biscayne, Fla.
