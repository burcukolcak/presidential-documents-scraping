2.Whereas,after compliance with the requirements of Section 102 of the Tariff Classification Act of 1962 (76 Stat. 73), the President by Proclamation No. 3548 of August 21, 1963 (77 Stat. 1017), proclaimed, effective on and after August 31, 1963, the Tariff Schedules of the United States, which reflected, with modifications, and, in effect, superseded, Proclamation No. 3454 by providing for the increased duty on imports of such floor coverings in item 922.50 in Subpart A of Part 2 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States;
3.Whereas,pursuant to Section 351(c) (2) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and in accordance with Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the President, by Proclamation No. 3815 of October 11, 1967 (81 Stat. 1138), extended the increased rates of duty on imports of floor coverings provided for in item 922.50 in Subpart A of Part 2 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States to the close of December 31, 1969;
4.Whereas,the increased duty on imports of floor coverings provided for in item 922.50 will terminate at the close of December 31, 1969, in accordance with Section 351(c) (1) (B) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, unless extended under Section 351(c) (2) of that Act;
5.Whereas,in relation to the possible extension of such increased duty, I have received and taken into account the advice from the Tariff Commission and the advice of the Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of Labor in accordance with Section 351(c) (2) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, recommendations of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations in accordance with Sections 3 (b), 3(j), and 5(c) of Executive Order No. 11075 of January 15, 1963 (48 CFR 1.3(b), 1.3(j), and 1.5 (c)), and advice of other interested agencies of the Government; and
6.Whereas,pursuant to Section 351(c) (2) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and in accordance with Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, I have determined that the partial extension, as herein proclaimed, of the increased duty on imports of floor coverings provided for in item 922.50 is necessary to prevent serious injury and is in the national interest.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including Section 351(c) (2) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and in accordance with Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, do proclaim that the increased rate of duty on imports of floor coverings provided for in item 922.50 in Subpart A of Part 2 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States is extended in part, as amended below, with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the period beginning on January 1, 1970, and ending at the close of December 31, 1972, unless the President proclaims otherwise pursuant to Section 351(c) (1) or (2) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The article description in item 922.50 shall read:
"Wilton (including brussels) and velvet (including tapestry) floor coverings, and floor coverings of like character or description, provided for in item 360.46 of Part 5A of Schedule 3 all the foregoing other than imitation oriental floor coverings."
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this 31st day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fourth.
