Statement About Signing Six Bills Authorizing Disposal of National Stockpile Materials
I HAVE signed six bills (S. 2413, S. 2316, S. 2498, S. 2551, S. 2493, and S. 2166), which will give the General Services Administration the authority to sell approximately $900 million of aluminum, copper, zinc, molybdenum, silicon carbide, and opium which are currently stockpiled by the Federal Government but which are no longer needed for national defense purposes.
The Congress, and particularly the Armed Services Committees, deserve appreciation and commendation for their constructive review of the supply and demand factors which make these disposals possible without detriment to our national security interests.
In order to facilitate a timely review of other unneeded materials which have been proposed for disposal, I am requesting the General Services Administration to provide the Congress with data on them comparable to the information presented in connection with the disposal bills I have signed into law.
Note: The bills, approved on December 18, 1973, were:
S. 2413, disposal of stockpiles of aluminum-Public Law 93-220 (87 Stat. 913)
S. 2316, disposal of stockpiles of copper--Public Law 93-24 (87 Stat. 910)
S. 2498, disposal of stockpiles of zinc--Public Law 93-212 (87 Stat. 909)
S. 2551, disposal of stockpiles of molybdenum--Public Law 93-219 (87 Stat. 912)
S. 2493, disposal of stockpiles of silicon carbide--Public Law 93-216 (87 Stat. 911)
S. 2166, disposal of stockpiles of opium--Public Law 93-218 (87 Stat. 912)
The statement was released at San Clemente, Calif.
On the same day, the White House released a statement and the transcript of a news briefing on the stockpile disposal bills by Frederic V. Malek, Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
