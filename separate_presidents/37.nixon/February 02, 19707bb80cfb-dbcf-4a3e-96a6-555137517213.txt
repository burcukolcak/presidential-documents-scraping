Statement About the Death of Representative Glenard P. Lipscomb of California
IT WAS with great sadness and a feeling of personal loss that I learned of the death of Glen Lipscomb. He was an outstanding Congressman, chairman of the California delegation of his party, and highly respected among his colleagues of both parties in the Congress. And it was not only his superb record as Congressman that made Glen Lipscomb respected; it was his admirable record as a man.
I personally learned of his great abilities in 1950 when he volunteered his assistance in my campaign for the U.S. Senate and again in 1952 when he gave his time and talent to help operate my Washington office at the time I was candidate for Vice President. Since then, many Americans-in and out of political life--have discovered his capacity for hard work and his devotion to high principles. The Nation has lost a fine American; California has lost a congressional leader; many of us have lost an irreplaceable friend. Mrs. Nixon joins me in offering deepest condolences to the family of Glen Lipscomb.
Note: Representative Lipscomb, 54, died of cancer on February 1, 1970, at Bethesda Naval Hospital. He had served in Congress since 1953.
On February 3, the President attended memorial services for Congressman Lipscomb at the Fourth Presbyterian Church in Bethesda, Md.
