Message to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa Meeting in Addis Ababa on the Occasion of Its 10th Anniversary.
THE UNITED STATES sends warm congratulations on this tenth anniversary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. We join in celebrating the solid achievements of the Commission. We wish it continued
SUCCESS.
Through a decade of hard work and dedication, the Commission has pioneered in promoting international efforts to developing Africa. It has inspired fruitful new cooperation both within the Continent and between Africa and other regions. It has helped African Governments approach the challenges of growth with confidence and careful planning. And it has encouraged the translation of plan to practice that builds the progress we all seek.
I have seen at first hand Africa's remarkable potential. The Commission, under the able leadership of its Executive Secretary, has certainly brought that potential nearer to reality. I know it will continue to point the way in African development.
As we look ahead to the next decade, all of us have high hopes for the future of the Continent. The United States is proud to be associated with the common quest for a better life. You have my very best wishes as you meet to chart the goals of the Commission for the years of promise ahead.
RICHARD NIXON
