Statement About the Death of Marianne Moore
MRS. NIXON and I join the Nation today in mourning the loss of one of our most distinguished poets, Marianne Moore. Admired for her imaginative style and adored for her love of man and animal, she was an endearing companion to her readers for a half century. In her, as she said there should be in all poetry, was truly "a place for the genuine."
We can be grateful that the splash of color and enchantment which she added to the Western World will brighten our landscape for many years to come.
Note: Miss Moore, 84, died in her sleep at her home in New York City on February 5, 1972.
The statement was made available to the press at Key Biscayne, Fla.
