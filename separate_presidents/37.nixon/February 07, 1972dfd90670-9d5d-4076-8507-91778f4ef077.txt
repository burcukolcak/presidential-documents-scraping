Statement About the Death of Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson
THE DEATH of Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson deprives the Nation--and, indeed, the entire world---of one of its wisest and most experienced counselors in statecraft.
He served a succession of Presidents with consummate skill in the arts of diplomacy.
I was particularly indebted to him when he came out of well-earned retirement to advise me personally, on the crucial SALT talks, and to participate in the early negotiating sessions as a member of the U.S. Delegation.
I deeply regret the passing of this great public servant, who contributed so much to the successes of American foreign policy over the past generation.
Mrs. Nixon and I join Ambassador Thompson's wife and children--and his many friends, colleagues, and admirers in Washington and around the world in mourning this grave loss to the Nation.
Note: Ambassador Thompson, 67, died of cancer at the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., on February 6, 1972. He had served as Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1957 to 1962 and from 1967 to 1969, Ambassador at Large, Department of State, from 1962 to 1967, and member of the United States delegation to the strategic arms limitation talks from 1969 to 1972.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers represented the President at funeral services for the Ambassador.
