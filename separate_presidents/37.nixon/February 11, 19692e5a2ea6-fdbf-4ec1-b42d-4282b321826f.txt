Letter to the Chairman, Civil Aeronautics Board, on the Transpacific Route Investigation.
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I have received the letter of the Acting Chairman of February 7, transmitting a proposed stay order in the international phase of the Transpacific Route Investigation, Docket 16242. I have concluded that the proposed order would be inappropriate, and I therefore decline to approve it.
In accordance with my letter of January 24, 1969, in the Transpacific Route Investigation (your Docket 16242 et al.) which rescinded the prior Presidential action and recalled the matter for my further review, please submit for my approval a Board order vacating the Board's order of December 18, 1968, in this case (No. 68-19-105) and the certificates attached thereto.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable John H. Crooker, Jr., Chairman, Civil Aeronautics Board, Washington, D.C. 20428]
