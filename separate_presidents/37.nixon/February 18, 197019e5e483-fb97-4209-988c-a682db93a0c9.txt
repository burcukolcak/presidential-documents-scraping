Message to the Congress Transmitting the First Annual Report on United States Foreign Policy.
To the Congress of the United States:
In my State of the Union Message to The Congress and on other occasions, I report to The Congress and the American people on specific aspects of foreign affairs. The Secretary of State also frequently makes reports to the appropriate committees of The Congress on foreign affairs, and the Secretary of Defense must deal with such matters as they relate to military programs.
Up to now, however, there has been no comprehensive report on foreign affairs submitted to The Congress on behalf of the Administration as a whole. I am, therefore, transmitting to The Congress this report on my Administration's stewardship of foreign relations. I hope the report will lead to a better understanding by The Congress and the American people of the spirit in which this Administration has sought to guide our foreign affairs, of what has been accomplished so far, arid of our new approach to the challenges and opportunities of the world of the 1970s.
