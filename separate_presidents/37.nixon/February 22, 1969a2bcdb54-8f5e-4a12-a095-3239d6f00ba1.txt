Memorandum on the Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Traffic in the District of Columbia
Memorandum for the Attorney General
In my recent message concerning crime in the District of Columbia, I recognized that illegal traffic in narcotics and dangerous drugs is an acute and growing problem in the District and that it is directly linked to the commission of crimes of violence. It is therefore imperative that prompt and effective action be taken to combat illegal narcotic and dangerous drug traffic in the District of Columbia. To that end, I request that you immediately direct the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to concentrate its efforts and channel its available resources to deal with this problem.
The precise steps to be taken must, of course, be determined by you in consultation with the Director of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs and the District of Columbia Government. But among other possible initiatives, I suggest that you consider the following:
--Employment of additional personnel by the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs for enforcement in the District and those cities which represent the major sources of supply for the District;
--Training programs in detection, apprehension, and treatment of narcotics addicts and drug dependent persons for District law enforcement personnel, school teachers, correction personnel and public health officials;
--Additional technical and scientific assistance to District officials concerned with narcotic addiction and drug abuse.
It is apparent that increased enforcement efforts, educational programs and technical assistance will require additional manpower and funds. Accordingly, you and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget should, if necessary, request additional appropriations from the Congress in order to ensure that these needs can be expeditiously met.
