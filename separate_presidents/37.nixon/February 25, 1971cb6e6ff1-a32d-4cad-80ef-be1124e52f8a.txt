Message to the Congress Transmitting Second Annual Report on United States Foreign Policy.
To the Congress of the United States:
In a democracy, policy is the public's business. I believe the President has an obligation to lay before the American people and its Congress the basic premises of his policy and to report fully on the issues, developments, and prospects confronting the Nation.
Shortly before my inauguration, I concluded that an annual Presidential report on foreign policy would serve these ends well. Each report would measure progress and outline what remains to be done.
I hereby transmit to The Congress the second annual Presidential review of United States foreign policy.
This year my message will be supplemented by two major documents: the Secretary of State's review--the first of its kind--and the annual Defense Report by the Secretary of Defense. Both of these will be comprehensive and detailed accounts, filling out the basic framework and philosophy set forth in this Presidential message.
