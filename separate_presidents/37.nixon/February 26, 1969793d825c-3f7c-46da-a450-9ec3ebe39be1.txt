Message to the President of Israel on the Death of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol.
Dear Mr. President:
All Americans join me in sending you and the people of Israel our deepest sympathy for your tragic loss. Levi Eshko1 was a man of great compassion and a true servant of his people. We shall all be the poorer for his passing.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
