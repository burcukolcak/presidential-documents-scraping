Remarks at the Swearing In of Caspar W. Weinberger as Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.
BEFORE the swearing in, I would like to say a personal word. I know the new Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. I have known him for, I think, over 20 years.
I have known him as one who has been and could be an enormous success in private practice of the law, who has a distinguished career in State government, and one who now comes to the Federal service as well qualified as any man who has ever received an appointment from this administration.
I know these are glowing words, but they are deserved in the case of Cap Weinberger. And we are most fortunate that we were able to get him and his wife to leave California, a State which they love, as I do, to come to Washington and to take this very important assignment as Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.
Judge Fickling will administer the oath, and Mrs. Weinberger will hold the Bible.
[At this point the oath of office was administered by Judge Austin L. Fickling of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. The President then resumed speaking.]
Now, Mr. Chairman, you seldom have an opportunity to say a word at the White House because this is an independent agency. It is supposed to be independent. But in any event, you can say a word now, if you like.
Note: The President spoke at 11:38 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. Mr. Weinberger's response to the President's remarks is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 6, p. 43 ).
