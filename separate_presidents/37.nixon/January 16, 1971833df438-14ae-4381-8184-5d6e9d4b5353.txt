Letter to Dr. Henry A. Kissinger on His Decision To Continue as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.
Dear Henry:
Your decision to resign from the faculty of Harvard University so that you can remain as a member of my Administration is one that I know was very difficult for you. The intensity of both your devotion to scholarship and your affection for Harvard are well known to your friends and associates. I want you to know that I greet your decision with deep personal appreciation.
Frankly, I cannot imagine what the Government would be like without you. Your wise counsel and strong support over the past two years have meant a great deal to me. During this time, our country has made great strides toward achieving that just and lasting peace which has always been our objective. The Nation's many accomplishments in the field of foreign policy during these past two years have been due in no small measure to your energy and to your vision.
I am grateful for what you have done and I am grateful that you are staying.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable Henry A. Kissinger, The White House, Washington]
