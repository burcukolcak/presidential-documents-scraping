Statement About the Death of Frederick A. Seaton
I AM deeply saddened by the death of Fred Seaton, a valued friend of more than 20 years. America was enriched by his many years of selfless and dedicated service in a wide range of positions including Secretary of the Interior in the Eisenhower Administration and United States Senator from Nebraska.
Fred Seaton was a son of our Nation's heartland. A distinguished servant of his Government and a newsman and news publisher, he graced the lives of all who knew him. Mrs. Nixon joins me in extending to his family our most sincere condolences at the loss of this good and gracious man.
Note: Mr. Seaton, 64, died in Minneapolis, Minn., on January 16, 1974. He served in the Senate from 1951 to 1953 and was Secretary of the Interior from 1956 to 1961. At the time of his death, he was publisher of the Hastings Tribune in Nebraska.
