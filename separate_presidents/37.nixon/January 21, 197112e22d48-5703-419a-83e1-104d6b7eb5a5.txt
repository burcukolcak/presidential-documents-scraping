Statement on the Death of Senator Richard Brevard Russell of Georgia.
WITH the death of Senator Richard Russell, America mourns the passing of one of her greatest sons.
A quarter of a century ago, when I first came to the Congress of the United States, Richard Russell of Georgia was already a name that inspired a universal admiration and respect, from legislative adversaries and allies alike. He possessed in unprecedented abundance a rare blend of courage, character, vision, and ability that moved him indisputably into the ranks of those giants who have served in the United States Senate.
When the security of the United States was the issue, six American Presidents leaned upon this great patriot; he never failed them. I am honored to have served with him briefly in the Senate; I am honored to have known him as a friend.
The Nation whose security was his constant concern for four decades in the upper chamber will be ever in his debt. His home State of Georgia, which he represented with such nobility, perseverance, and skill, can take perpetual pride in his memory.
Note: Senator Russell, 73, died at Walter Reed General Hospital of respiratory complications.
He had served in the United States Senate since 1933, and was chairman of the Committee on Armed Services 1951-52 and 1955-68, and chairman of the Committee on Appropriations 1969-71.
