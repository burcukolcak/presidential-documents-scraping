Statement Announcing the Appointment of Dr. Arthur F. Burns as Counsellor to the President
TODAY I am pleased to announce a major appointment. Dr. Arthur Burns, a longtime friend and trusted adviser, has agreed to join the White House Staff as the Counsellor to the President. Dr. Burns will have Cabinet rank.
He will head up a small group whose prime responsibility will be the coordination of the development of my domestic policies and programs. Dr. Martin Anderson, one of my Special Assistants, will serve as his deputy. Dr. Burns' role will be that of a generalist, dealing with a broad province of legislative and executive actions.
Besides being a brilliant scholar with a worldwide reputation in economics, Dr. Burns is an able administrator who has been in charge of the National Bureau of Economic Research for many years.
Dr. Burns will, of course, work closely with members of the Cabinet, Dr. McCracken, Mr. Harlow, and others on the White House Staff.
Note: Dr. Paul W. McCracken was Chairman designate of the Council of Economic Advisers and Bryce N. Harlow was an Assistant to the President.
