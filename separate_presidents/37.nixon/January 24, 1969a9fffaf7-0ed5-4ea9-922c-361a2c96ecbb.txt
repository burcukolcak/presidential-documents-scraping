Letter to the Chairman, Civil Aeronautics Board, Relating to the Transpacific Route Investigation.
Dear Mr. Chairman:
Upon a review of the actions taken by your Board and President Johnson in connection with the Transpacific route investigation (your Docket 16242 et al.), I have come to the conclusion that it is both appropriate and necessary for me to rescind the prior Presidential action taken and recall the matter for my further review and decision.
Please do not take any further action in connection with the international aspects of this matter until I have had an opportunity to finally advise you of my decision upon the merits.

Very truly yours,
RICHARD NIXON
[The Honorable John H. Crooker, Jr., Chairman, Civil Aeronautics Board, D.C. 50428]
Note: The President's letter was made as part of a White House release the President's action concerning the investigation.
