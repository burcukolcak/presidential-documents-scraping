Remarks About the Special Message to the Congress on Education Priorities.
THERE IS one goal that unites all Americans. Each of us wants our children to have the very best education that this great Nation can provide. To achieve that goal, I have today asked the Congress to enact a number of significant education initiatives during 1974.
One would provide advanced or forward funding so that school authorities can know a year in advance how much Federal money they will have to spend. No longer would school boards have to gamble on how they would balance their budgets.
Another initiative would target Federal funds so that students with the greatest needs, the truly disadvantaged students, are the major recipients of funds.
A third initiative would expand the grant and loan programs for students faced with rapidly increasing costs of education after high school.
These proposals, along with others that I have sent to the Congress, will ensure the successful development of our greatest natural resource, the children of America.
Note: The President spoke at 2:35 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. His remarks were filmed for later broadcast on radio and television.
On the same day, the White House released a fact sheet and the transcript of a news briefing on the message by Caspar W. Weinberger, Secretary, and Frank C. Carlucci, Under Secretary, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
