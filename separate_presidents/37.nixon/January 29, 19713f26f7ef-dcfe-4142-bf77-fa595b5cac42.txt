Message to the People of the Virgin Islands.
To the people of the Virgin Islands:
It is with great pleasure that I add to the vivid memories I cherish of my visit with you as Vice President. My recollection of those sunny days, warmed further by your friendliness, made Governor Evans' repeated invitations irresistible. Mrs. Nixon and I are delighted at the opportunity to be among you once again.
Your proud traditions and heritage are everywhere in evidence. And your impressive development and bold future programs reflect the spirit of an industrious and forward-looking people: the spirit of optimism and success.
It is the human as well as natural resources of your islands that make visitors so anxious to return. Mrs. Nixon and I are no exceptions. And we look forward to many happy returns.
RICHARD NIXON
