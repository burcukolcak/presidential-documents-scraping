Statement on the Death of President Juan Domingo Peron of Argentina.
MRS. NIXON and I, on behalf of the American people, have sent a message of condolence to the wife of former President Peron. We are saddened by the death of the President of the Argentine Republic, Juan Domingo Peron, who was a source of inspiration to his countrymen. At a time when others would have been content to retire from public life, he accepted the challenge to return to his country to guide and assist the Argentine people. He dedicated the last years of his life to this task.
Note: President Peron, 78, was President of the Argentine Republic from 1946 to 1955, and from September 1973 until his death in Buenos Aires.
The President designated Secretary of Commerce Frederick B. Dent as his Personal Representative, with the rank of Special Ambassador, at funeral services for President Peron held in Buenos Aires on July 4. Other members of the official delegation included Robert C. Hill, United States Ambassador to Argentina, and Jack B. Kubisch, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs.
The statement was released at Moscow, U.S.S.R. and Washington, D.C.
