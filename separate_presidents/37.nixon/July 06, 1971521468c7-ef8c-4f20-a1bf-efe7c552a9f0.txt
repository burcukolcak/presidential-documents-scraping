Statement on the Death of Louis Armstrong.
MRS. NIXON and I share the sorrow of millions of Americans at the death of Louis Armstrong. One of the architects of an American art form, a free and individual spirit, and an artist of worldwide fame, his great talents and magnificent spirit added richness and pleasure to all our lives.
Note: Mr. Armstrong, 71, died of a heart attack in his home in Corona, Queens, N.Y. He achieved worldwide fame as a jazz musician and trumpet player.
The statement was made available to the press on board Air Force One en route to San Clemente, Calif.
