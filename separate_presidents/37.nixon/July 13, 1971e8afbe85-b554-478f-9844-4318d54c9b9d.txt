Statement About the Death of Edgar N. Eisenhower
MRS. NIXON and I wish to express our deep personal sorrow at the death of Edgar Eisenhower. Mr. Eisenhower was a warm friend. He not only was a distinguished member of an illustrious family but was a man who throughout his life was dedicated to principle.
Note: Mr. Eisenhower, 82, died of a stroke in Tacoma, Wash., on July 12, 1971. He was an elder brother of the late President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
The statement was read by Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler during a news briefing at the Western White House, San Clemente, Calif., on July 13, 1971.
