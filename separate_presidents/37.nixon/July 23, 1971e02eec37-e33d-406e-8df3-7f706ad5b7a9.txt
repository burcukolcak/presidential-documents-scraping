Statement on the Death of President William V. S. Tubman of Liberia.
IT WAS with profound sadness that Mrs. Nixon and I learned today of the death of President William V. S. Tubman of Liberia. A leading African statesman for a quarter of a century, President Tubman was well known and highly respected in the United States. During his years as President of Liberia, the close and friendly relations between the United States and Liberia were continually strengthened. The world will sorely miss his wise counsel and effective leadership.
President Tubman will be long remembered for his accomplishments in Liberia and in Africa. During his tenure as President, he worked tirelessly for the unity of Liberia's diverse peoples and for the economic well-being of his country. Under President Tubman's leadership, Liberia played a vital role in the United Nations and was a moving spirit in the Organization of African Unity.
Liberia's sorrow at this sad time is shared by the American people. On their behalf, I express our deepest sympathy to President Tubman's family and to all

Liberians.
Note: President Tubman, 75, died in London, England, of complications resulting from surgery. He had served as President of Liberia since 1943.
The statement was posted for the press.
On July 26, 1971, the White House announced that Robert H. Finch, Counsellor to the President, would represent President Nixon at funeral services for President Tubman.
