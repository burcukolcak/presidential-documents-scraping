Letter to Prime Minister Golda Meir on the Inauguration of Communications Satellite Service for Israel.
Dear Madame Prime Minister:
As your nation inaugurates its station connecting Israel with the Intelsat system, you have the best wishes of the American people.
Clear and effective communication is basic to building the generation of peace we so earnestly seek, and to ensuring the kind of sound relationships among nations which will enable that peace to endure.
We are delighted that Israel is joining the family of nations linked by this new system, and happy to convey through our representative, Mr. Dean Burch, our warmest greetings and hopes that this important step may benefit your fellow citizens and all mankind.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Her Excellency Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel]
