Statement on the Death of John L. Lewis.
THE DEATH of John L. Lewis takes away from the American scene one of the giants of our time, a man who helped to shape modern America. His talents were great, his energies prodigious. Few men in contemporary American life have been as controversial; few men possessed the proud heart and the passionate mind to engage in such large-scale controversies. His impact on the coal-mining industry, on organized labor, and on the entire range of the American economy cannot be exaggerated. Mrs. Nixon joins me in extending deepest sympathy to his family.
Note: John L. Lewis, President of the United Mine Workers of America for 40 years, died on June 11, 1969, at the age of 89.
