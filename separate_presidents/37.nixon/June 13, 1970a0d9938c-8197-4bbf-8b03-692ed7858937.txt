Statement Appealing to Americans To Assist the Victims of the Earthquake in Peru
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, there are few times in the lives of all of us when we are called upon as we are this Sunday, to extend the spirit of humanity and brotherhood to a fellow nation.
The country of Peru, a neighbor nation in this hemisphere, has undergone the worst catastrophe ever suffered by a people of the Americas. An earthquake which struck Peru 2 weeks ago has taken over 50,000 lives. One out of every 12 Peruvians has been left without a home, without warm clothing, without food. Thousands of children have been orphaned. To them and their families we extend our prayers and sympathy.
As President of the United States, I appeal to you--as individuals and as a nation--to express our concern and grief through actions that will help to relieve the suffering that tragedy has brought to Peru.
Note: The statement was released at Key Biscayne, Fla.
