Remarks on Transmitting to the Congress the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and the Interim Agreement on Strategic Offensive Arms
I AM sending to the Congress today the nuclear arms limitation agreements that I negotiated with the Soviet leaders in Moscow.
I am convinced that these agreements are in the security interest of the United States. They will enable the United States to maintain defenses second to none, defenses that will protect the interests of the United States at home and abroad.
I believe that prompt approval by the Senate of the treaty limiting defensive weapons and prompt approval by the Congress of the agreement limiting certain classes of offensive weapons will contribute to the goal that I know all Americans share--a goal of ending the arms race and building a more peaceful world.
Note: The President's remarks were filmed in the Family Theater at the White House for later broadcast on radio and television.
On the same day, the White House released a letter from Secretary of State William P. Rogers transmitting to the President the ABM Treaty and the Interim Agreement on Strategic Offensive Arms, with agreed interpretations and unilateral statements. The letter, dated June 10, 1972, is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 8, p. 1027).
