Statement on Occasion of Signing of Agreement Between the United States and Japan About the Reversion of Okinawa to Japan
When Prime Minister Sato visited Washington in November 1969, he and I agreed that our Governments would consult together on arrangements leading to the reversion of Okinawa to Japan in 1972. The Agreement signed today marks the conclusion of those negotiations. Because of the importance of this Agreement, it will be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent. I will urge the Senate to give its advice and consent.
The friendship and mutual respect which enabled our negotiators to resolve the many difficult issues will, I am sure, enable us to work together in peace for the continued progress of our own two countries, and for that of the entire world.
My best wishes to the people of Japan, and to their leaders. We both have much to be proud of this day.
Note: Secretary of State William P. Rogers read the statement at the signing ceremony in the Thomas Jefferson Room at the Department of State.
