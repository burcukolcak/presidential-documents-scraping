Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report on the Food for Peace Program.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit to the Congress the 1970 annual report on agricultural export activities carried out under Public Law 480. In a year which saw more than its share of disasters around the world, Public Law 480 concessional sales programs and donations once again reflected the desire of the people of the United States to try to help others improve their own circumstances by improving the agricultural foundation of their economies.

The Public Law 480 program demonstrated its flexibility in 1970 both by responding quickly to the immediate needs of countries in distress, and by using food assistance to promote long range development in developing countries. One important example of the program's scope and success was our aid to victims of the earthquake in Peru--much of which was channeled through voluntary relief agencies.
The Public Law 480 program also provided increasing benefits to the United States. Currencies generated by the program together with the increasing volume of payments received under past long term credit sales agreements, resulted in a contribution of more than $300 million to our balance of payments in 1970. In addition, this program has placed increasing emphasis on helping recipient nations develop their own economies and thus become better export markets for the United States.

Public Law 480 has now been extended through 1973. As our efforts move forward, we will continue to stress both trade development and food assistance through this highly esteemed program.
