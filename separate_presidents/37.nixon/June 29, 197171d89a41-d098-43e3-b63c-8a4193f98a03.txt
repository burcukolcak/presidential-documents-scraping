Message to the Senate Transmitting Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith a copy of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, signed at Vienna February 21, 1971. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State with respect to the Convention.
Nationally and internationally, we are faced today with a very' serious problem posed by a new group of dangerous drugs--the psychotropic or "mind-bending" substances, such as LSD, mescaline, amphetamines, barbiturates and tranquilizers. It is the purpose of this Convention to limit to medical and scientific uses those substances that are liable to abuse but not covered by the existing treaties for the international control of narcotic drugs. The Convention will close an important gap which now exists in international drug regulations.
Nearly all of the psychotropic substances are manufactured rather than derived initially from plants, as are the narcotic drugs--such as heroin--that are involved in so much illicit traffic. As a major manufacturer of psychotropic substances, it is important that the United States cooperate with other countries in efforts to limit the use of those substances to medical and scientific purposes. I urgently recommend, therefore, that the Senate give early consideration to the Convention and that it give its advice and consent, with the reservation as proposed in the report of the Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.
