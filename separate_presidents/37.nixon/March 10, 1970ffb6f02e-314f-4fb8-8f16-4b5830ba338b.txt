Proclamation 3970â€”National Farm Safety Week, 1970

The efficiency of American agriculture and the quality of life for agricultural workers is threatened today by the continued high rate of farm accidents. Many thousands of farm residents lose their lives or are seriously injured in accidents every year. Both the human and the financial costs of these accidents are intolerable.
A quarter century of experience in organizing for rural safety has shown that most farm accidents could be prevented through sensible practices and protective devices. Safety information and mechanical safeguards are readily available and their consistent use should be actively encouraged.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of July 19, 1970 as National Farm Safety Week. I urge all farm families, and every person and group allied with agriculture, to make every effort permanently to reduce the number of accidents which occur at work, in homes, at recreation, and on the roadways.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.


RICHARD NIXON
