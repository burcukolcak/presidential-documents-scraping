Statement About House Committee Action on the Postal Reform Bill
THE DECISION of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee to report out the postal reform bill is an important victory for the Nation's mail users and for the 750,000 postal workers. It is a significant first step on the road to total reform of an institution which has failed to keep pace with the mounting demands of our modern economy and expanding Population. I hope that the full House and the Senate will move promptly to enact this major piece of reform legislation.
This measure provides the tools financial, managerial, and technological--necessary to enable the dedicated men and women who wear the uniform of the postal service to deliver the quality mail service which the public deserves and expects. It reaffirms the principle that partisan politics and the mail do not mix--that there is no Republican or Democratic way of delivering the mail; only the right way.
Final enactment of this monumental reform measure will usher in a new, progressive era. It is my hope that it will arrive on my desk for signature at the earliest possible time.
