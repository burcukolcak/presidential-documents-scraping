Message to the Congress Transmitting Report on Control of Hazardous Water Pollutants.
To the Congress of the United States:
I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of the Congress a report on "Control of Hazardous Polluting Substances" as required by Section 12(g) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended.
The recommendations made in the enclosed report reflect the conclusions reached by the Department of Transportation in its study made at my request. Additional study, beyond that possible in the short period available for this report, may indicate a need for modifications in these recommendations. Such modifications would be incorporated in any legislation which is developed to implement the recommendations of the report.
