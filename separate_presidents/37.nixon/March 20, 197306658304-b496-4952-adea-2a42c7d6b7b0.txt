Exchange of Remarks With the Co-Chairmen of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Joint Commission on Scientific and Technical Cooperation.
ACADEMICIAN V. A. TRAPEZNIKOV [Acting Co-Chairman]. The Academician (V. A. Kirillin) wasn't well. Then he had an operation. Now he is up and about and in about a month's time he will be working again.
THE PRESIDENT. Give him my best wishes.
ACADEMICIAN TRAPEZNIKOV. He was very sorry he could not come on this trip, and he extends to the President his best regards.
DR. H. GUYFORD STEVER. Mr. President, Academician Trapeznikov has done a superb job in picking up the Chairmanship and we are making great progress. We have already agreed to six major areas and we are exploring six more areas in science and technology. These range from energy, water resources, agriculture, use of computers in cities in a large-scale manner. It is going very well.
ACADEMICIAN TRAPEZNIKOV. The work which we are doing is regarded as very important. You do remember the very important agreement signed, and we feel that each side will benefit from it.
THE PRESIDENT. Signed in Moscow.
DR. STEVER. Yes. In fact, in addition to the specific agreement that we are working on this trip, the signing of the agreement on science and technology, plus the other initiatives that you have taken, have triggered a great amount of cooperation in science and research, exchange of technical data with firms. And I think the progress is excellent.
