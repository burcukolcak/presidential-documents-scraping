Statement on the Death of Chet Huntley.
I HAVE LEARNED with sorrow of the death of Chet Huntley. One of America's earliest and finest television newsmen, he will be remembered as a pioneer in electronic reporting and as a true professional who tried to present the news fairly and objectively.
Mrs. Nixon and I extend to Mrs. Huntley our heartfelt condolences.
Note: Chet Huntley, 62, died in Bozeman, Mont. From 1956 to 1970, he co-anchored the National Broadcasting Company's evening news program, the "Huntley-Brinkley Report."
