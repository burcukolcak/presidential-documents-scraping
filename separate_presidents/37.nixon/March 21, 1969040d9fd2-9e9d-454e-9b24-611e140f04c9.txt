Richard Nixon
March 21, 1969

Remarks at Van Horn High School, Independence, Missouri.
I AM DELIGHTED to have the opportunity, with Mrs. Nixon, to stop for a moment on our way out to see President Truman. It occurred to me that it would be worth reminding all of you that in just a month or so we will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the NATO Alliance.
Most or all of you were born since that happened, but when that happened, when President Truman was President, I was a freshman Congressman, and as a Republican, I supported this concept which was developed by a Democratic President.
What I am trying to say to you today is that this visit, shortly before President Truman's 85th birthday, is a demonstration of the fact that where the strength of America is concerned and policies that will keep the peace of the world so that you young people will not have to be involved in any wars in the future, that we are not Republicans or Democrats, we are Americans. That is what this visit is all about.
So, we thank you very much. We wish you the very best in your work, not only in high school, but in whatever endeavor you select in the future.
I can say that I have a particular understanding and affection for not only those who are students in high school, because two of our daughters have just been through that experience and then gone on to college, but also because my wife, when I met her, was a high school teacher. So treat your teachers real well.
Thank you.
Note: The President spoke at 11:16 a.m. at Van Horn High School, Independence, Mo. Following his remarks the President went to the Truman home and then accompanied former President and Mrs. Truman to the Truman Library.
