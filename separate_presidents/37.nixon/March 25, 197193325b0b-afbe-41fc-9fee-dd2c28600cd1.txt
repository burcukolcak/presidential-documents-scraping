Remarks to Reporters at a Briefing on a Special Message to the Congress on Executive Branch Reorganization
Ladies and gentlemen:
I have selected this particular message to came to the press room to present the briefers because of its historic significance. This message on Government reorganization is the result of 2 years of study within the Administration. Without the persuasive arguments that were made for this plan by Secretary of the Treasury Connally when he was a member of the Ash Council, this message would not be going to the Congress today.
He feels very strongly that this not only has historical significance but that it is imperative in terms of making our Government work better in this last third of this century. Consequently, I have asked him, not just in his capacity as Secretary of the Treasury but primarily as a member of the Council that was responsible for making these recommendations which I have now endorsed, to lead off on the briefing team, and then Mr. Weber of the OMB will go into any of the details.
Note: The President spoke at 11:32 a.m. in the Briefing Room at the White House. On the same day, the White House released the transcript of a news briefing on the proposed reorganization by Secretary Connally and Arnold R. Weber, Associate Director, Office of Management and Budget.
