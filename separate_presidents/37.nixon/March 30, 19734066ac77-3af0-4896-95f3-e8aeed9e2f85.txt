Letter to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House Transmitting Proposals To Authorize Reduction or Suspension of Import Barriers
I HEREWITH transmit a draft bill, "to authorize reduction or suspension of import barriers to restrain inflation."
The proposed legislation would authorize the President to reduce or suspend temporarily any duty applicable to any article and to increase temporarily any value or quantity of articles which may be imported under any import restriction whenever the President determines that supplies of the article imported are inadequate to meet domestic demand at reasonable prices.
The enactment of this bill is necessary to provide an important additional means of restraining inflation and aiding the American consumer.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
Note: This is the text of identical letters addressed to the Honorable Spiro T. Agnew, President of the Senate, and the Honorable Carl Albert, Speaker of the House of Representatives.
The White House press release also included the text of the draft bill.
