Statement About Attempt on the Life of Governor George C. Wallace of Alabama
I JOIN Americans everywhere in deep concern for Governor Wallace's condition. I ask all Americans to join me in praying for his speedy and full recovery, and also for that of the others who were wounded in this senseless and tragic incident.
Our Nation has suffered more than enough already from the intrusion of violence into its political processes. We must all stand together to eliminate its vicious threat from our public life; we must not permit the shadow of violence to fall over our country again.
Note: The statement was read to reporters by Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler.
On May 15, 1972, Governor Wallace was shot and seriously wounded while attending a political rally at Laurel Shopping Center, Laurel, Md.
