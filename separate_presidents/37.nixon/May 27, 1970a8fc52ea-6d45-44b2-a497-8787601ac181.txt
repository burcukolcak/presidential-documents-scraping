Statement on Signing a Bill Naming the Harry S. Truman Dam and Reservoir in Missouri.
IT IS highly fitting that the Kaysinger Bluff Project in Missouri should be named in honor of a great Missourian and great American who always believed in and worked for the conservation of our natural resources. As a county judge, Harry Truman was concerned with the development of the Big Blue Basin. As Senator and Vice President and President, he supported water-resources management throughout the Nation. In recognition of his lifelong concern for the wise use of our natural resources, I am pleased to sign this bill which honors him by naming this project the Harry S. Truman Dam and Reservoir.
Note: The bill (S. 3778), approved May 26, 1970, is Public Law 91-267 (84 Stat. 265).
