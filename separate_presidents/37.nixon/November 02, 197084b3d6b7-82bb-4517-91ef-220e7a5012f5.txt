Exchange With Reporter About the Election on Arriving at Riverside, California.
REPORTER. Mr. President, do you have any comments on the election tomorrow?
THE PRESIDENT. No. I think that this is the time for everybody to be thinking about the decision they are going to make. I have completed my campaigning. I am delighted to have a chance to visit Riverside and see my mother's oldest sister, my Aunt Edith, who is now living in Riverside. She has been ill for some time.
I am very pleased, too, to see this political interest over here. I must say, of course, I have my definite ideas about the congressional race here, as well as the senatorial race and gubernatorial race. I think Vic Veysey is one of the most outstanding candidates I have met and I am delighted that he has got a lot of supporters here. This looks like a good sign for him. I will just put it this way: I predict he is going to win.
Note: The exchange of remarks took place at 10:30 a.m. at Riverside Airport.
Victor V. Veysey was the Republican candidate for the United States House of Representatives from the 38th Congressional District.
