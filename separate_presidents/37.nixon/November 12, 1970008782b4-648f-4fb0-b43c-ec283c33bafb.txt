Remarks on Arrival at Paris for Memorial Services for General de Gaulle
I wish to convey to all the people of France, and particularly to Madame de Gaulle and General de Gaulle's family, the condolences of all of the people of the United States on this very sad occasion.
General de Gaulle is gone, but France lives because of what he did. And his life is an example, seldom paralleled in history, of triumph over adversity--an example for all to follow in the years ahead.
I feel most fortunate that I had the opportunity of knowing him both officially and personally, and to have had the benefit in the past of his wisdom, of his judgment, and his great vision about the problems of the world. And that opportunity that I have had has been of great benefit to me in the decisions that I have made in the past, and it will continue to be a source of benefit, encouragement, and inspiration in the years ahead.
Note: The President spoke at 12:49 a.m. at Orly Airport.
The memorial services were held at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.
