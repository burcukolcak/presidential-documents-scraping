Statement on the Death of Joseph P. Kennedy.
JOSEPH P. KENNEDY leaves a long and distinguished record of service to his country--a genuinely unique record that involved his entire family in the making of American history. He inspired his family to share his own strong sense of dedication to his Nation. He enjoyed with grace the triumphs of his life, and he endured its tragedies with great dignity. And surely he also felt great satisfaction in his own and in his family's service and accomplishments. Mrs. Nixon and I know that we are joined by countless Americans and by people all over the world as we express our deepest sympathy to the Kennedy family.
Note: Joseph P. Kennedy, financier, former U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain, and father of the late President John F. Kennedy, died at the age of 81 at his home at Hyannis Port, Mass., after a long illness.
