Remarks on Arrival in Limerick, Ireland.
Mr. Mayor:
I want to say that it is a very great privilege for me to visit, on my trip to Ireland, and come first to Limerick. This is the first city in Ireland I am visiting.
Having heard of Limerick all my life, and recalling in the 18th century when the famous Irish Brigade was fighting all over the world, the song was "Will You Come Up To Limerick?" and here I am. I am glad to be here, and I am glad I came.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke in response to the remarks of James D. Liddy, Right Worshipful Councillor who spoke as follows:
On behalf of the citizens of Limerick, as well as in my own behalf, I want to extend to His Excellency, President Richard Nixon, a very warm and a very cordial welcome to the city of Limerick.
I think he has, by dropping off here to say hello to us, paid a very great honor indeed and we are certainly very indebted to him and we hope he will have a very happy stay in this country.
Thank you.
