Statement About Congressional Action on the Proposed Revenue Act of 1971
TODAY'S vote by the House of Representatives in favor of the tax bill reflects an overwhelming national will for prompt legislative measures to stimulate the economy, create jobs, and halt inflation. I am deeply grateful for this timely action by both the House and its Committee on Ways and Means.
The scheduling of hearings on the tax bill tomorrow by the Finance Committee of the Senate is another welcome indication of the bipartisan Congressional support for the new economic program. I am confident that, with Senate cooperation, the American people will soon have an effective tax bill enacted into law.
