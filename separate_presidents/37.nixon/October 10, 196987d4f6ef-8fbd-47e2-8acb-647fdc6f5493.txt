Statement About National Newspaperboy Day, 1969
AS AMERICANS commemorate National Newspaper boy Day, we give deserving recognition to a youthful occupation that, perhaps more than any other, inspires the qualities of integrity, leadership and good citizenship in all walks of life.
There is no limit to the number of successful businessmen, doctors, lawyers, government officials, and countless other citizens who began their road to achievement on a newspaper delivery route.
Their experience taught them about people. It developed their sense of responsibility. And it showed them the satisfaction that derives from serving others.
As we applaud these young men, we salute America in the making--and we anticipate the future good that will come from the dedication of newspaper boys in their line of duty.
My personal admiration for them is second to none. And my best wishes are with them as they forge the tools for their chosen careers and build a promising future for themselves and for the nation that is so proud of them.
RICHARD NIXON
