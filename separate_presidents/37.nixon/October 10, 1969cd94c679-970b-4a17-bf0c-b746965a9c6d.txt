Statement Announcing the Appointment of Lieutenant General Lewis B. Hershey as Advisor to the President on Manpower Mobilization
FOR 33 YEARS, General Hershey has served with distinction in the Selective Service System. He has administered a program of paramount importance to the security of the United States, and few Americans have performed a more important service to their country through difficult and often turbulent days. The Nation owes General Hershey a hearty "well done."
I look forward to having the benefit of General Hershey's advice and counsel as we move ahead on a broad range of reforms designed to ensure that our manpower mobilization policies are equitable, efficient and geared to the requirements of the future. General Hershey brings to his new assignment vast experience and a perception into national manpower resources, perhaps unmatched in the country. The Nation is fortunate that it will continue to have his wise counsel.
Note: An announcement of the President's intention to nominate General Hershey is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 5, P. 1394).
