Statement on the Death of Dean Acheson.
OF THOSE who stand for a time in places of power, many are quickly forgotten. It is a measure of Dean Acheson's stature as man and statesman that almost 20 years after his service as Secretary of State, he continued to be recognized as one of the towering figures of his time. He was a man not only of great achievement but also of rare intellect, of rigorous conscience, and of profound devotion to his country. As President, I have been deeply appreciative of the advice that I have asked, and that he has so freely and graciously given. I shall greatly miss both his wise counsel and his penetrating wit.
The Nation, the Western Alliance, and the world all share in the loss of one of their staunchest champions.
Note: Mr. Acheson, 78, died of a heart attack at his home, Harewood Farm, in Sandy Spring, Md. He had served as Secretary of State from 1949 to 1953.
The statement was posted for the press. On October 13, 1971, the President signed Executive Order 11626 providing for the flying of the flag at half-staff as a mark of respect to the memory of Mr. Acheson.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers represented the President at memorial services for Mr. Acheson at the Washington Cathedral on October 15.
