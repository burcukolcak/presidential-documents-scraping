Statement in Support of Republican Candidates in New Jersey.
I HAVE COME to New Jersey to help Nelson Gross because I want him to come to Washington and help the Nation.
If the people of New Jersey want a Senator who takes a strict stand against the perpetrators of violence in America; who believes that our college campuses should be ruled by reason and not by force; who would take strong action against the menace of drugs; who himself has been a law enforcement official, and would take strong action against crime-then Nelson Gross is the man.
As New Jersey's Senator, Nelson Gross would stand up for America's position in the world, and help us not only to achieve peace in Vietnam but also to achieve our goal of a full generation of peace. He would help us keep the "Big Spenders" from chewing holes in the housewife's pocketbook. With his strong support of welfare reform, he would help get people off the welfare rolls and onto payrolls. He would help New Jersey--which now ranks last among the States in Federal money returned per tax dollar--to get its fair share of Federal outlays. He would help us help every State by enacting a plan to turn a part of the Federal tax dollar back for the States and localities to use themselves.
There is another point that I think is important. Nelson Gross would be working with New Jersey's other Senator. He would be working with the Governor and with the White House--and that means he could do more for New Jersey, and New Jersey's two Senators, together, would give New Jersey a stronger voice and do more for the country.
So I urge the people of New Jersey to vote for Nelson Gross for the U.S. Senate--and for the entire Republican ticket, so they can help us to achieve the things America needs today and in the critical but promising years ahead.
