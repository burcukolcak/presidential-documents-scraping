Letter of Congratulations to Willy Brandt on His Election as Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Dear Mr. Chancellor:
It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you on your elevation to the high office of Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. You have already done much for your people, as governing Mayor of Berlin and as Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor. The admiration and respect you have won throughout the world in these earlier capacities promises much for the discharge of the even greater and more challenging duties you have now assumed. I think you are aware of the confidence you have won throughout the world in years.
In our complex and difficult world today, I particularly value such elements of stability as the close relationship that exists between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany. I attribute the highest importance to the maintenance of this relationship, which I am convinced must be based on mutual understanding and confidence. Whenever occasion warrants, I would like to feel free to consult with you directly on ,matters of mutual interest. I will welcome it if you will do the same.
I look forward to the prospect of working with you in the interest of those objectives which join our two countries in responsibility as well as friendship.

With warm personal regards,

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
