Statement About National Bible Week
IT IS a great honor for me to join the American Bible Society, the Catholic Biblical Association, the Laymen's National Bible Committee, and all who participate in the special recognition of National Bible Week.
It is most fitting that this traditional observance is to be held during the week of Thanksgiving. For as each of us pauses to reflect on the meaning of the Bible in our lives, we surely have some special instance for which to express our thanks to God for strengthening our faith through Holy Writ.
I am especially reminded of Benjamin Franklin's immortal thought when he remarked that if no sparrow can fall to the ground without His notice, no nation can rise from the ground without His help. Throughout our history, despairing men and women have found sustaining solace in the word of God as written in the Bible. Families have been guided by its enlightened precepts. Statesmen and leaders have drawn inspiration from its teachings, and courage from the enriching experience it records.
It is unique among books and treasured by men and nations. And the power of the universal truths it holds is appropriately refreshed within our hearts on this occasion. The past has truly proved that we have much to gain by our devotion to the Scriptures. And the future holds great promise if we heed past lessons well.
So in the spirit of this timely week, let us draw upon the timeless wisdom of the Book of Books to guide us in our daily lives.
Note: In recognition of the President's service as honorary chairman of National Bible Week, W. Clement Stone, national chairman, presented him with a miniature copy of a statue entitled "We Shall Beat Our Swords Into Plowshares" in a ceremony at the White House on October 22, 1969. The original statue stands in the garden of the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
