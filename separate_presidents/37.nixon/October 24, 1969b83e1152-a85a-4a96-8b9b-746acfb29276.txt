Statement on a Safety Policy for the Federal Government.
THE HUMAN suffering and economic waste caused by accidents are principal concerns of this administration. Federal, civil, and military personnel and the public must be protected; governmental programs must be efficiently run. These two goals can best be realized by a unified, dedicated, and on-going program of accident elimination in government.
We are making progress in this area. In 1965 when Mission SAFETY-70 was begun, the disabling injury frequency rate was 7.7. The rate for 1968 was 6.9, a three percent improvement over the previous year and an overall 10.4 percent improvement. Through this effort an estimated $12,210,000 was saved, and 16,200 disabling injuries were prevented.
There is still great progress to be made. Department or agency heads play a major role in the elimination of accidents. If a department or agency has an effective program in this area, it should be continued; if it does not have an adequate program, one should be developed; if the program needs the necessary resources to make it effective, resources should be provided. Everyone in a department or agency should know that a safety program is effective only to the degree that it is supported and participated in by employees.
In a united effort, the Federal Government will work with labor unions representing government employees, with State and local governments, and with appropriate safety organizations in developing and applying sound accident prevention principles and practices.
The Secretary of Labor is directed to advise me annually, and at such other times as he deems appropriate, of the actions taken and the progress made by each agency.
