Statement on the Virginia Gubernatorial Campaign.
LINWOOD HOLTON has my unqualified and enthusiastic support in his campaign to become Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia. He has the character and the capability to be one of the truly great Governors in the history of this State which has produced many of America's greatest political leaders.
I know this to be true because I have worked beside Lin Holton in many causes in recent years. He is not a man discouraged by temporary reversals; he has the perseverance, dedication, intelligence, and drive that are among the prime ingredients of great executive leadership.
When the times were most difficult in my own career, it was to men like Lin Holton that I turned, and on whom I counted.
The victory of Lin Holton and his team of State Senator Buz [H. Dunlop] Dawbarn and Dick [Richard D.] Obenshain will give Virginia exactly the kind of administration it needs in the years ahead. They have the new ideas, and they offer the fresh and aggressive leadership that are indispensable to the future of strong and sound government at the State level in this country.
