Statement in Support of Republican Candidates in Texas.
TEXAS, a State which has produced many strong leaders over the years, has an opportunity this year to elect two leaders of outstanding strength to important leadership positions.
Both George Bush and Paul Eggers are men of great character and great ability. They are independent men--men with the courage to put their convictions into action. As Senator and as Governor, they will provide leadership of which all Texans can be proud.
I am proud to say that I have worked closely with bath these candidates. Paul Eggers held a key post in the Treasury Department during the first year of my administration. George Bush is an important leader in the House of Representatives. I know from close experience that both of them are doers and not mere talkers. They have earned solid reputations as effective problem-solvers.
With George Bush in the Senate, we can increase the momentum of progress toward meeting our greatest challenges. The chances for a full generation of peace are brighter than they have been in a long time. Crime rates have stopped climbing and have begun to go down again. After a difficult battle against big spending, we see signs on every hand that our economic strategy is working. Inflation has been checked and will slow still further. Interest rates are definitely on the way down, and housing starts are up.
George Bush can be depended upon to help me press ahead on the great issues of reform, restoration, and renewal.
Both George Bush and Paul Eggers gave up important positions in order to seek higher offices where they can do more for Texas and more for America. I urge the voters of Texas to give them that opportunity.
