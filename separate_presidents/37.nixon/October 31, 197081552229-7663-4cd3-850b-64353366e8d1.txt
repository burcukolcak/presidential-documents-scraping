Letter to the Publisher of the San Jose Mercury News.
Dear Joe:
I want you to know that I will assume personal responsibility for seeing to it that the ugly incident at the Rally on Thursday night does not reflect on the good name of San Jose and the fine people in that community. It is quite obvious that the violent radicals selected this particular occasion to create an incident, and the fact that it happened to occur in San Jose can be no reflection whatever on the people of that community or on San Jose State College.
Through the years, going back to 1950, I have visited San Jose on many occasions and have always come away with memories of the cordial receptions I have received there. I shall remember Thursday night for the five thousand people in the Hall who were listening courteously to what I had to say and gave me a very friendly reception after my remarks, rather than the thousand or so ugly demonstrators outside the Hall. I look forward to the time when I can return to San Jose on another occasion. Perhaps you and I can have another visit from the balcony of your beautiful home and see the progress that has occurred in that Valley since the last time we were there.

Best personal regards,
RICHARD NIXON
