Telegram to the President of the Student Body of San Jose State College.
I GREATLY appreciated your comments about the incident Thursday night in San Jose. You can be sure that I was totally aware of the fact that only a small number of San Jose students participated, that a substantial number of those who created the disturbance were from outside of the city, and that the overwhelming majority of San Jose State's 24,000 students completely disapprove of violence and lawlessness as tactics which can be used to further any cause.
I have great faith in young Americans because of their idealism. I share their concern for peace at home and abroad. I admire them for their idealism and for their desire not only to make a good living for themselves when they finish school, but to make life good for less fortunate people across this Nation and in the world who have not had the opportunity for a fine education.
I recall two previous occasions when I have visited the campus of San Jose State and received a very friendly welcome from students who were there to listen and who would have been completely repelled by any group who tried to deny them their right to listen by shouting down the speaker.
I hope you will extend my very best wishes to all the members of the San Jose State student body. I pledge to you, and to them, that I will do everything I possibly can to achieve the goal which we have not had in this century--a full generation of peace for them and, hopefully, for their children.
RICHARD NIXON
