Statement Announcing Transfer of 18 Parcels of Land Under the Legacy of Parks Program
TODAY I am pleased to announce that under our rapidly expanding Legacy of Parks program, the Federal Government will soon transfer 18 parcels of land to State and local governments for park and recreational use.
These transfers mark a significant milestone in the Legacy of Parks program, for when they are completed, we will have created new parklands in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
These 18 properties total just over 8,000 acres and are located in 14 States and the District of Columbia. They will bring the grand totals for the Legacy of Parks program to 218 transfers to local governments covering over 34,000 acres of land.
The Legacy of Parks program was inaugurated 19 months ago by my Executive Order 11508. In that order, I established a Property Review Board and directed it to identify property which was underutilized and could be converted to higher and better use.
The success of this program has been extremely gratifying to me. It proves that with sound and thoughtful programs, we can make major improvements in our natural environment. I am particularly pleased that many of the new parks and recreational areas created by this program are located near urban areas, for this means that just as we are bringing government closer to the people, we are also bringing a better quality of life closer to our people.
Note: A White House announcement containing additional information on the transfer of the 18 parcels of land under the Legacy of Parks program was released on the same day and is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 8, p. 1607).
