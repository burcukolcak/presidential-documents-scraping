Statement on the Jewish High Holy Days.
IN THIS SEASON of the Jewish High Holy Days, my warmest New Year's wishes are extended to all my fellow Americans of the Jewish faith. I share your hope that the eve of September 12, which ushers in a New Year on your calendar, may mark the beginning of an era which will bring new blessings of peace and prosperity for all mankind.
Inspired by this year's triumphant demonstration of man's capacity to master the technology and intellectual challenge of our age, may all men of good will join their efforts toward the achievement of well-being here on earth. Out of the glory we have witnessed and before which we stand in awe, may man's terrestrial as well as his celestial life be fortified and enriched.
The holy season you celebrate particularly reminds us of the urgent need for self-examination and for rededication to the imperatives of justice and mercy. It stirs the conscience of men throughout the world to right the wrongs and alleviate the suffering that mar the progress we have realized. And it brings us all together in the prayer that the words of the prophet Isaiah may gain fulfillment in our lifetime, and that nation shall not lift up sword against nation.
The American Jewish community has throughout the history of our Nation been in the forefront of the search for true equality, dignity, and decency for all. But at this time, we are especially reminded of the enduring contributions you have made to the unrelenting search for a real brotherhood of man under the Fatherhood of God. Our thoughts are with you as you begin these solemn days of worship, and our hearts are filled with gladness as we extend to each of you the traditional Hebrew greeting, Shanah Tovah: A Happy New Year.
