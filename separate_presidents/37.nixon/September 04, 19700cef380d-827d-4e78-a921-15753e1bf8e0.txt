Message for the Jewish High Holy Days.
IT IS often thought and expressed that we in the modem world know all the problems faced by mankind but have just to find the solutions. And in looking for ways to ease man's struggles, we are more likely to suggest what others might or should do.
Jewish tradition teaches that the power to do good or evil is in our own hands, and the season of the Jewish High Holy Days holds a meaningful lesson for men of all faiths. At this time we are urged to look inward, to examine our own lives and to consider what each of us can do for the betterment of mankind. These days of atonement prod us to an awareness of man's own worth and dignity, and of the divine and human potentialities within each of us. They are days of great hope, for the driving force of man's freedom is in his ability to look inward, appraise his limitations, and seek means to widen his horizons.
My thoughts are with you as you begin these days of worship and I send my warmest wishes to all Americans of the Jewish faith for a New Year of peace and happiness. Shanah Tovah!
