Statement on the Death of Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen of Illinois.
EVERETT DIRKSEN was one of a kind--and a remarkably likable man. To politics and government he brought a dedication matched by few and a style and eloquence matched by no political leader in our time.
He had his greatest moments as the leader of the loyal opposition. In the history of that role in the Congress, he had unequaled influence and accomplishment.
He will be remembered as a giant in the history of Congress and as one who on the great issues always placed the Nation first. I mourn the loss of this great Americana legislator of matchless skills, and my warm personal friend since my first days in the Congress 22 years ago.
Note: Senator Dirksen died on September 7, 1969, at Walter Reed Army Medical Center following a cardiac and respiratory arrest at the age of 73.
He served in the House of Representatives from 1933 to 1949, in the Senate from 1951 until the time of his death, and as Minority Leader of the Senate since 1959.
The President on September 8 and 10 issued Executive Orders 11479 and 11481 ordering flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of the late Senator.
The statement was released at San Clemente, Calif.
