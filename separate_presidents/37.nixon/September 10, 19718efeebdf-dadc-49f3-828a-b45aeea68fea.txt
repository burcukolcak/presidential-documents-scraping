Statement on the Death of Senator Winston L. Prouty of Vermont.
AMERICANS everywhere join the people of Vermont in mourning the death of a distinguished United States Senator and an outstanding patriot. Mrs. Nixon and I share acutely in this public grief and in the personal bereavement of Senator Winston Prouty's family.
Win Prouty was my good friend. He was a beloved and able leader in the United States Senate, entirely dedicated to the constituents and the Nation he served.
His personal integrity earned him the respect of all who knew him. The sensitivity, compassion, and candor so magnificently reflected throughout Win Prouty's legislative record will be an enduring source of inspiration for those who succeed him and a source of strength for all the people of the country he loved so well.
Not long ago I said that Win Prouty does not speak often, but when he does speak everyone listens. Through his many lasting contributions to the Nation's well-being, Senator Prouty will continue to speak to all of us for a long time to come.
Note: Senator Prouty, 65, died of cancer in Boston, Mass.
