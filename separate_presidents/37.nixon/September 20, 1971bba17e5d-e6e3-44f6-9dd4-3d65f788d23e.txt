Statement Announcing Nomination of Romana A. Banuelos as Treasurer of the United States
IT IS with special pleasure that I have today nominated Romana A. Banuelos to be Treasurer of the United States.
Since the tragic and untimely death of Dorothy Andrews Kabis on July 3, we have searched the country for a person of truly outstanding credentials and ability to succeed her as Treasurer. I was delighted to find such a person in Mrs. Banuelos. In her extraordinarily successful career as a self-made businesswoman, Mrs. Banuelos has displayed exceptional initiative, perseverance, and skill. In addition, as chairman of the board of directors of Pan American National Bank of East Los Angeles, which serves the Mexican-American community of that area, she has not only proven herself a highly able bank executive but has also contributed substantially to the development of that community.
The post of Treasurer of the United States is one of high honor and high responsibility. Mrs. Banuelos will bring to it a high measure of distinction.
Note: A White House announcement of the nomination, containing additional biographical information on Mrs. Banuelos, was released on the same day and is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 7, P. 1304).
