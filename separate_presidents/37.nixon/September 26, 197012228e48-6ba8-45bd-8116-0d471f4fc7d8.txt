Proclamation 4013â€”National PTA Week

Seventy-three years ago, in a moment of significance for the future of this Nation, the American parent-teacher movement was born.
Educational and philanthropic leaders of the day gathered in Washington, D.C., for the first meeting of an organization called the National Congress of Mothers. Its founding purpose: to foster a strong and fruitful relationship between the mothers of America and the teachers of their children.
That organization, now the National Congress of Parents and Teachers, has provided effective leadership at the national level, focusing the thinking and action of its membership on problems of urgency and importance. Its thousands of local chapters enable parents and teachers to counsel together on specific concerns of their own school and community, and to act as informed and understanding citizens.
As a tribute to the important contributions of the parent-teacher movement to the American way of life, and the continuing efforts of the National PTA to provide quality living and quality learning for all Americans, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 228, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating National PTA Week from October 5 to October 9, 1970.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the period of October 5 through October 9, 1970, as National PTA Week.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fifth.
