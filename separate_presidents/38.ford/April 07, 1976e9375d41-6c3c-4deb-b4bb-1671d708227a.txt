Remarks Upon Presenting the Boys' Clubs Boy of the Year Award
I MIGHT say, John, and reiterate what I have said to these boys, that we are proud of them, and I think they should be proud of what they have done. I think all of us recognize the tremendous job that the Boys' Clubs have done throughout the country not only this year but over a long period of time, some 20 years or more, since the Boy of the Year program has been initiated.
The added thing is, I am very proud to be Honorary Chairman of the Boys' Club. It is a recognition of my interest in the organization and my full support for it. To see these fine young men here coming in and having the opportunity of getting their awards in the Rose Garden is a way, I think, we can build up and expand and further increase the influence of Boys' Clubs throughout the country.
I do want to thank, also, the Reader's Digest Foundation, which I understand sponsors or supports the Boy of the Year program. Without it, we couldn't have these fine young men down here getting these awards today.

So, we thank them; we thank all of you who handle the programing and, more particularly, we congratulate Robert and the other nine regional participants.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 12:15 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House where he greeted the regional finalists in the 30th annual "Boy of the Year" competition, which is sponsored by the Boys' Clubs of America. He presented Robert Lee Fisher, of Pasadena, Calif., with a walnut plaque proclaiming him the boy who best typifies juvenile decency in action.
In his opening remarks, he referred to John Burns, national president of the Boys' Clubs of America.
