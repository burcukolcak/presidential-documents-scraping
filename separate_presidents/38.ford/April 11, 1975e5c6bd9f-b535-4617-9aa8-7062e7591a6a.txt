Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate Transmitting Proposed Legislation To Assist the Republic of Vietnam
I HEREBY transmit draft legislation to carry out the recommendations made in my April 10, 1975 address to the Congress with respect to Indochina.
The enclosed draft bills authorize additional military, economic, and humanitarian assistance for South Vietnam, and also clarify the availability of funds for the use of the Armed Forces of the United States for humanitarian evacuation in Indochina, should this become necessary. I urge the immediate consideration and enactment of these measures.

Sincerely,
GERALD R. FORD
Note: This is the text of identical letters addressed to the Honorable Carl Albert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Honorable Nelson A. Rockefeller, President of the Senate. The texts of three draft bills were included as part of the release.
