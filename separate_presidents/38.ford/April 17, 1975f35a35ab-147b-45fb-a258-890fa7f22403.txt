Statement on the Fall of the Cambodian Government.
THE United States views the fall of the Government of the Khmer Republic with sadness and compassion.
I wish to express my admiration for the Cambodian Government leaders and people, who showed great courage until the end, and to their armed forces who fought valiantly with their remaining supplies.
Note: Elements of the Khmer Rouge entered the city of Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975, after a siege lasting approximately 4 months.
