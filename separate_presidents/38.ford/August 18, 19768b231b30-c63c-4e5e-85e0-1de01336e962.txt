Gerald R. Ford
August 18, 1976

Remarks to President Ford Committee Staff in Kansas City.
LET ME just thank all of you that I didn't have a chance to express my appreciation with a handshake.
It was a great night last night, and it came about because of all the hard work of people like yourselves, not only here but all over the country. It is a big step toward the result that we are going to get tonight and the more important result we are going to get November 2.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 8:45 a.m. in the Liberty Room at the Crown Center Hotel.
