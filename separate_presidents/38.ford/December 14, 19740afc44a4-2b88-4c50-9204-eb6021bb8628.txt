Statement on the Death of Walter Lippmann.
WITH the death of Walter Lippmann, we have lost a great American. As a newsman, political analyst, and author, Walter Lippmann played a major role for more than half a century in the development of public dialog and in shaping a new standard of journalism.
Mr. Lippmann's contributions to the good society which he envisioned for his country will long be remembered.
Note: Mr. Lippmann, 85, died in New York City. He wrote a nationally syndicated newspaper column, Today and Tomorrow, from 1931 to 1967, for which he received Pulitzer Prizes in 1958 and 1962. The statement was released at Martinique, French West Indies.
