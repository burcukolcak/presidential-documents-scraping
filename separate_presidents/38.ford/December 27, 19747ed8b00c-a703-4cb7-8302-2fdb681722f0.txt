Telegram to Mrs. Jack Benny About the Death of Her Husband.
MY FAMILY and I were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of your devoted husband. For the past half century, Jack Benny brought joy and laughter not only to us but to millions of other Americans.
Jack's service to his country, his charitable works, and his genuine enjoyment of the humor of others are accolades that he wore with modesty, grace and charm. If laughter is the music of the soul, Jack and his violin and his good humor have made life better for all men.

We will remember you in our family prayers.
GERALD R. FORD
Note: Jack Benny, 80, died on December 26 in Beverly Hills, Calif. The text of the telegram was released at Vail, Colo.
