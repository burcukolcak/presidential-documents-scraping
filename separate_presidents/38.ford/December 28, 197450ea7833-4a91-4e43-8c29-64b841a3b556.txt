Statement on Signing Legislation Establishing the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area in Ohio.
I HAVE approved H.R. 7077, which establishes the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area in Ohio. The establishment of this area paves the way for the preservation of thousands of acres of unspoiled land for the enjoyment of present and future generations.
In signing this bill, I want to express my reservation about a provision of the bill which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide Federal police and fire services to the area, or reimburse local agencies which perform these services. I ask the Congress to amend this legislation to remove this provision so that police and fire services are provided by local agencies, without reimbursement, as in other such Federal recreational areas.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 7077, approved December 27, 1974. is Public Law 93 555 (88 Stat. 1784). The statement was released at Vail, Colo.
