Statement on the Bombing Incident at La Guardia Airport, New York City.
I AM deeply grieved by the loss of life and injuries which occurred tonight at La Guardia Airport in New York. It appears this senseless act involved the use of a bomb.
I have instructed Secretary of Transportation William Coleman and the FAA to investigate immediately and to give me a complete report on the tragedy as soon as possible. The Justice Department and the FBI have been directed to provide whatever assistance they can to the FAA and local law enforcement agencies.
Note: Eleven persons were killed by the explosion from a bomb placed in the baggage-claim area at the airport.
The statement was released at Vail, Colo.
On the following day, the President met in the Cabinet Room at the White House with Secretary of Transportation William T. Coleman, Jr., Federal Aviation Administrator John L. McLucas, Deputy Attorney General Harold Tyler, and Deputy Director James Adams of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to discuss the progress of the investigation of the bombing incident. They also considered measures to be taken to reinforce airport and airplane security.
