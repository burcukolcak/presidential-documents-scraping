Remarks Upon Receiving the Boy Scouts of America's Annual Report to the Nation.
LET ME thank you, Arch and Alden and left and David and Larry, for coming here to represent scouting.
I have many fond personal memories of scouting going back a good many years, not only as a scout--they didn't have Cub Scouts in those days--but also as a participant in the senior activities of scouting.
I think the fact that 60 million young men have participated over a period of 66 years, is indicative of the strength that scouting has contributed to a better America. I just hope that scouting goes on forever, because it is a great contributor to all of what we stand for in this country.
I hope that in the future there will be many Presidents who will be honored, as have been, by your presentations today. And I thank you, Jeff and David and Larry, Arch, as well as all of you. This has been a fine opportunity, not only to meet you but all of these outstanding young men and women who are here in the Oval Office on this occasion.

Good luck.
Note: The President spoke at 4:23 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House. In his opening remarks, he referred to Arch Monson, Jr., Boy Scouts of America president; Alden Barber, chief scout executive; Jeff F. Hunsaker and David E. Honigs, national youth representatives of the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts, respectively; and Larry A. Carpenter, National Explorer president.
