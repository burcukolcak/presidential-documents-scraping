Message to the Congress Transmitting the United States-German Democratic Republic International Fishery Agreement.
To the Congress of the United States:
In accordance with the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-265; 16 USC 1801), I transmit herewith a governing international fishery agreement between the United States and the German Democratic Republic, signed at Washington on October 5, 1976.
This Agreement is significant because it is one of the first to be negotiated in accordance with that legislation. I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date. Since 60 calendar days of continuous session as required by the legislation are not available before March 1, 1977, I strongly recommend that the Congress consider issuance of a joint resolution to bring this Agreement into force by that date.
GERALD R. FORD
