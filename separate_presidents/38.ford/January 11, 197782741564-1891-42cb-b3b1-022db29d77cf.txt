Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on the Organization of Federal Energy Functions.
To the Congress of the United States:
Under the provisions of section 162 (b), P.L. 94-385, the Energy Conservation and Production Act of 1976, I am required to submit recommendations to the Congress on the reorganization of Federal energy and natural resources activities.
A study of alternative organizational arrangements has been underway since May 1976 under the leadership of the Office of Management and Budget and the Energy Resources Council.
After considering the alternatives, I have decided to recommend that the Congress approve creation of a Department of Energy. The details of the proposed organization, together with the necessary legislation, are included in the enclosed report which was prepared by the Office of Management and Budget and the Energy Resources Council.
I commend the report to the attention of the Congress and urge prompt action to create a Department of Energy.
GERALD R. FORD
