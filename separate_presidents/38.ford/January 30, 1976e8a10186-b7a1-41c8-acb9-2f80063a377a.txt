Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate on Administration Actions To Control Federal Travel.
IN RESPONSE to the Congressional request that Federal travel should be controlled to restrain the inflationary impact of Federal expenditures and to conserve the use of energy, I have instructed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review Administration actions on this matter of mutual concern. Enclosed is a memorandum from the Director, OMB, that outlines actions taken to restain travel.
The enclosed memorandum, with which I concur, is transmitted to the Congress pursuant to section 205(c) of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1976 (Public Law 94-157).
Respectfully yours,
GERALD R. FORD
