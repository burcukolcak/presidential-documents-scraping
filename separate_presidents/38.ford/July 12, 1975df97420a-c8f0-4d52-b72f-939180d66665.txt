Remarks at the Walter Hagen Invitational Golf Tournament in Traverse City, Michigan.
LET ME thank all of you for the opportunity of coming up and playing in the Walter Hagen golf tournament and to have the opportunity of being in Traverse City.
It was a wonderful day yesterday, and it is wonderful to be back this evening. I just wish that my score had been better. But it is too high. [Laughter]
But I had a lot of fun with good people, and I am delighted to be here with [Senator[ Bob Griffin today and Bob and Governor Milliken yesterday and all the fine people who are here from the region as well as from elsewhere.
It is very refreshing to come up to God's country. It is a wonderful place, not only in the summer like now, but as many of you know, we used to ski over at Boyne Mountain in the northern area up here.
It is just a charming, delightful place with superb people, and you have been nice to Betty and me, and we will try to come back if you will have us.

Thank you very much.
Note: The President spoke at 7:15 p.m. at the Traverse City Golf and Country Club. Following his remarks, the President attended an informal banquet for participants in the tournament.
