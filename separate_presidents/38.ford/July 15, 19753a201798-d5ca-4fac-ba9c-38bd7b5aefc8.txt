Statement on the Death of Former Representative Lawrence G. Williams of Pennsylvania.
I WAS saddened to learn of the death of former Congressman Lawrence Williams of Pennsylvania. It was my pleasure to serve in Congress with Larry for 7 years. During that time, he distinguished himself as a dedicated, hard-working public servant. Mrs. Ford joins me in expressing sympathy to Mrs. Williams and to Kathy and James at this sad time.
Note: Representative Williams served in the House of Representatives from 1967 to 1974.
