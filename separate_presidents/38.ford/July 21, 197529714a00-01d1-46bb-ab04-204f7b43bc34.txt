Remarks on Greeting the 1975 Wimbledon Tennis Champions.
WE ARE real honored to have the two Wimbledon champions--Arthur Ashe and Billie Jean King. We are pleased to have them in the White House. They represent the excellence in athletics in the field of tennis.
I just told them I watched them both on television and envied their competence and regretted that I could only watch and not participate.
We are proud of them and delighted to have them back after having done such a first-class job.

We are glad to have you.
Note: The President spoke at 3:10 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. Mrs. King won the women's singles title and Mr. Ashe, the men's singles title at the 1975 tournament held in Wimbledon, England, from June 23 to July 5.
