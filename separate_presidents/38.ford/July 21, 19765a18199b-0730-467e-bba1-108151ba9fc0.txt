Gerald R. Ford
July 21, 1976

Statement Following Senate Action on the Public Works Employment Act of 1976.
I DEEPLY regret today that the Senate has overridden my veto of the public works bill.
Both the Senate and I share a keen desire to expand job opportunities for all Americans, but I continue to believe that the wisest, most productive means of reaching that goal is through a steadily growing private sector--not through temporary jobs that are run by the Government, increase the national debt, and create new inflationary pressures.
The House can rectify the Senate action on Thursday and should, in the best interest of the Nation, sustain my veto.
Note: On July 22, 1976, the Senate voted to override the President's veto, and S. 3201 was enacted as Public Law 94-369 (90 Stat. 999).
For the President's message to the Senate vetoing the legislation and a statement on congressional enactment of the legislation, see Items 653 and 686.
