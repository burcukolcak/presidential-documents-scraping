Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Tel Aviv, Israel.
THE ACT of terrorism which occurred last night at Tel Aviv resulting in the tragic loss of innocent lives should be strongly deplored by everyone. Outrages of this nature can only damage the cause in whose name they are perpetrated.
I extend my deepest sympathy, and that of the American people, to the families of those persons who have been killed as a result of this senseless act.
Note: On the evening of March 5, 1975, eight Palestinian guerrillas seized the Savoy Hotel, holding guests hostage until Israeli Army troops advanced on the hotel on the morning of March 6. Three Israeli soldiers, three civilians, and seven guerrillas were killed during the ensuing battle.
