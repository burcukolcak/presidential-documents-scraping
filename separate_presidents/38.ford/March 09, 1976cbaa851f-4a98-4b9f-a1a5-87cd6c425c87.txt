Gerald R. Ford
March 09, 1976

Exchange With a Reporter on the Florida Primary Election Results.
REPORTER. Mr. President, what do you think of the results in Florida?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, naturally I was extremely pleased with the wonderful job all of our people did in Florida. They just did a tremendous job. I am delighted with the effort that was made, but also the deep conviction that our people had, and I am just overjoyed with the results.
Q. Does this mean you are on the way? Do you think it is time for your opponents to get out of the race?
THE PRESIDENT. Oh, I would not get into that. Tonight is not a night to talk about victory except to thank people for the fine job they did.
Q. Mr. President, thank you.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.
Note: The exchange began at 9:38 p.m. as the President was leaving the Sheraton-Park Hotel following his address to the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
