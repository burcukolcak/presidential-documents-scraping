Remarks Upon Signing the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1976.
Secretary Coleman, distinguished Members of the Congress, distinguished guests:
I am signing today a bill, H.R. 8235, which authorizes more than $17 1/2 billion dollars for the extension of the Federal aid to highways program. Many, many thousands of jobs will be directly as well as indirectly supported by the legislation, which will provide for key links in the Interstate Highway System, upgrade existing highways, and develop public transit facilities.
Primary responsibility for selecting projects and administering this grant program will continue to rest with State and local authorities. While this act does not include everything that this administration proposed to the Congress, it is an important step toward meeting America's transportation needs.
For that reason, Mr. Secretary and Members of the Congress, I am very pleased to sign this legislation, which is a very significant piece of legislation and a very important one as far as our economy and our transportation facilities are concerned.
Note: The President spoke at 3:03 p.m. at a ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House. In his opening remarks, he referred to Secretary of Transportation William T. Coleman, Jr.
As enacted, H.R. 8235 is Public Law 94-280 (90 Stat. 425).
