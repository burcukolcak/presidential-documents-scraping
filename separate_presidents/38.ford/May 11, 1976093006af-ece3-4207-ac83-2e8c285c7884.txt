Memorandum on the Combined Federal Campaign.
[Dated May 10, 1976. Released May 11, 1976]
Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
I am pleased to announce that The Honorable Richard L. Roudebush, Administrator of Veterans Affairs, has agreed to serve as Chairman of the Combined Federal Campaign for the National Capital Area this fall.
This campaign, which will begin in September, combines into a single drive the solicitation efforts of the United Way of the National Capital Area, the National Health Agencies, and the International Service Agencies. In this one drive we will seek to do our share to meet the needs of more than 150 local, national and international health, welfare and social service agencies.
These organizations deserve our wholehearted support. Working together through the Combined Federal Campaign we can provide the needed help for our neighbors and friends with special needs. To those in need, the voluntary agencies are a beacon of hope. Frequently, they are the only source for needed assistance.
Through the Combined Federal Campaign, Federal workers and military personnel are offered a unique opportunity to help persons in our community, in our Nation and in overseas lands by one gift once a year. Their pledges can be fulfilled through voluntary payroll deductions. I am confident that Mr. Roudebush will have your wholehearted support in this endeavor. I urge you to commend the campaign to Federal employees and military personnel in your organization.
