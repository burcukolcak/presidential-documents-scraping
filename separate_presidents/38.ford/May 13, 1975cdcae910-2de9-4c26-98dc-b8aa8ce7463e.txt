Statement on House Action Sustaining Veto of the Emergency Agricultural Bill.
I COMMEND the House of Representatives' action in sustaining, by a comfortable margin, my veto of the Emergency Agricultural Act of 1975,1commonly known as the farm bill.
1See Item 232.
The 182 Members who supported my veto acted in the best interests of the economy, of the consumer, and of farmers themselves. The bill would have retired inflation and set back the recent progress made in freeing farmers from Federal controls. The American farmer does a terrific job and will do a better job without the restraints this bill would have imposed.
This vote proves that there is enough concern in both parties in this Congress to hold the line on the deficit. I will continue to fight for Federal fiscal responsibility and welcome this show of support.
