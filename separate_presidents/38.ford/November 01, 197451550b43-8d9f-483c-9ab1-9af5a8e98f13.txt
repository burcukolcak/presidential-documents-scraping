Remarks at an Urban League Dance in Portland.
I AM HERE with Bob Packwood to participate in a very small way in a great cause, which is the Urban League. I belong to it. We have a great Urban League in my hometown, and the head of that in Grand Rapids is Paul Phillips. Some of you may know him--a very dear friend of mine.
It is just wonderful to be here with Hazel and all of you. I did not come to make a speech. I came to say hello and meet some of you and enjoy myself.
We have had a great, great day in Portland. It has been long but wonderful, and this is sort of a climax. And I thank you for your warm, warm welcome.
You might be interested--I saw the last half of the Trail Blazers and the Braves. The Trail Blazers won 109 to 102 (113 to 106).
Note: The President spoke at 10:30 p.m. at the Masonic Temple. The Urban League sponsored the dance for the benefit of the Albina Human Resources Center in Portland.
