Statement on the Death of Generalissimo Francisco Franco of Spain.
IT WAS with sorrow that I learned of the death of Generalissimo Francisco Franco, who led his country for almost four decades through a significant era in Spanish history. With his passing, I express deepest sympathy to his wife and family on behalf of the Government and people of the United States.
We wish the Spanish people and the Government of Spain well in the period ahead. The United States for its part will continue to pursue the policy of friendship and cooperation which has formed the touchstone for the excellent relations existing between our two countries.
Note: Generalissimo Franco was Chief of State from 1936 until his death on November 20, 1975.
Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller and U.S. Ambassador to Spain Wells Stabler represented the United States at the state funeral of Generalissimo Franco on November 23. On the previous day, they attended the swearing in of Prince Juan Carlos as Spain's Chief of State and proclamation as King.
