Remarks in Dallas at a Luncheon Honoring the President.
Thank you very much, Wayne, Governor Briscoe, Governor Boren, Governor Connally, distinguished Members of the United States Senate, the academic world, and all you wonderful people from Texas as well as Oklahoma:
It's nice to come in an atmosphere where athletic contests really don't make much difference. You know, I always get in trouble when I go to one community or another.
I had the good fortune to play football for the University of Michigan, back a long, long time ago, back when the ball was round--[laughter]--and of course, I have some prejudices when Michigan plays some of its traditional rivals.
If I go to East Lansing, Michigan, where Michigan State is--boy, they give me a hard time. But I get the most difficult time when I go down to Columbus. You are familiar with that great rivalry between my alma mater and Ohio State. Woody Hayes, who is a very great and good friend of mine--he doesn't talk about Michigan. He just says, "that school up North." [Laughter]
So, it's great to be here on an occasion where I can relax and cheer for both sides and have an opportunity to meet all of you and to enjoy the hospitality and the friendship of the people from Dallas, from Texas, and those from Oklahoma. It's just nice to be here.

Thank you very, very much.
Note: The President spoke at 1:45 p.m. in the Hall of Six Flags Room at the Hall of State Building on the Texas State Fairgrounds. In his opening remarks, he referred to Wayne H. Gallagher, executive vice president and general manager of the Texas State Fair, Governors Dolph Briscoe of Texas, David Boron of Oklahoma, and John B. Connally of Texas 1963-69.
The luncheon was hosted by the Texas State Fair Board.
