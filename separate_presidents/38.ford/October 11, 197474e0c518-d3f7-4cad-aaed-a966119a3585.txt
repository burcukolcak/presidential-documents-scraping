Remarks on Signing the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974.
BEFORE signing, I just want to thank all the Members of Congress who are here. I can recall rather vividly when this recommendation came to the Congress, and I am especially pleased that I have an opportunity to sign the legislation which establishes ERDA.
I think it is a tremendous step forward. It is really the result of hard work by the Congress and, I think, good recommendations by the Administration.
Now we are going to turn over to Rog--Rog Morton here--the overall responsibility to make sure that this, as well as the other parts of the energy program for this Government, proceeds as fast, and as effectively, and as efficiently as possible.
So, it is a particular pleasure for me to sign a rather short name with 11 pens, but I will do my best. [Laughter] I found that there was another left-handed President, President Garfield.

We will get a couple more and see that those are properly passed out.
Thanks for coming down. I apologize for being late, but we had the President of Somalia on his first visit in the Oval Office, and we had a very interesting conversation. I just could not break away.
So, thank you for waiting, and good luck to you, and I hope you all have a good vacation between now and November 11.
Note: The President spoke at 3:50 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White House.
As enacted, the bill (H.R. 11510) is Public Law 93-438 (88 Stat. 1233).
