Statement on Signing the Bill Designating Eugene O'Neill's Home and Property as a National Historic Site.
ONE OF the finest tributes that a country can pay to its giants in art and literature is to erect living memorials to their names.
Eugene O'Neill will always be a giant of American literature, so I take special pleasure in signing legislation establishing his home and property near Oakland, California, as a national historic site and as a home for the performing arts.
Eugene O'Neill was dedicated to the theater. This park will remind Americans for years to come not only of his contributions but those of many other artists who have added immeasurably to the wisdom and pleasure of all mankind.
Note: As enacted, the bill (S. 2398), approved October 18, 1976, is Public Law 94-539 (90 Stat. 2501).
