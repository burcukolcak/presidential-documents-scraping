Statement on the Death of Gen. Creighton W. Abrams, Jr.
GEN. CREIGHTON ABRAMS was an American hero in the best tradition. In the heat of battle and in the gray corridors of the Pentagon, he proved that he was that rare combination--a man of action who was also a first-class administrator.
He was also a colorful, courageous leader who won the admiration and respect of enemies as well as allies and subordinates. His 38-year military record spanned three wars, as he rose from first lieutenant in 1936 to Chief of Staff in 1972. He has left us an example of service and a memory of heroism that future generations of Americans, in and out of uniform, will long cherish. We will miss him very much.
Mrs. Ford joins me in extending to his wonderful wife and family our deepest condolences.
Note: General Abrams, 59, died at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, D.C.
On the same day, the President signed Executive Order 11802 directing the flag to be flown at half-staff until the day of interment as a mark of respect for General Abrams.
On September 6, 1974, the President attended funeral services for General Abrams at the Memorial Chapel, Ft. Myer, Va.
