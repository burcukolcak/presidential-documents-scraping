Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Report of the National Advisory Council on Economic Opportunity.
To the Congress of the United States:
I herewith transmit the Eighth Annual Report of the National Advisory Council on Economic Opportunity.
The report provides a perspective and recommendations which are, of course, limited to the particular area of interest of the National Advisory Council on Economic Opportunity. Thus, the report does not reflect the Administration's policies which must be formed in the context of a comprehensive review of the total Federal role and capability to assist the poor in light of other competing priorities.
GERALD R. FORD

THE WHITE HOUSE,

September 11, 1975.
Note: The report is entitled "National Advisory Council on Economic Opportunity--Eighth Annual Report" (Government Printing Office, 132 pp.).
