Statement Following Senate Action on a Bill To Extend the General Revenue Sharing Program.
I AM extremely pleased that the Senate has today overwhelmingly adopted legislation to extend the General Revenue Sharing program. The Senate bill closely follows my legislative recommendations for renewal of this important domestic program.
Continuation of this program, which provides substantial assistance to State and local governments, remains, however, one of the major unfinished items of business on the congressional agenda.
I urge the Democratic leadership in the House to take responsible and responsive action to convene an immediate conference on this bill. They have sought to portray themselves as friends of our Nation's cities. However, their record on this legislation stands in marked contrast to their rhetoric. In delaying action on this bill for over 1 year, they have jeopardized the fiscal and economic stability of our cities.
I hope the Congress will demonstrate its commitment by moving swiftly and favorably in getting responsible legislation to my desk for signature before they adjourn. To do less would only serve to aggravate the fiscal problems of. State and local governments and undermine economic recovery.
Note: The bill (H.R. 11367) passed the House on September 30, 1976, and was signed by the President on October 13. As enacted, H.R. 11367 is" Public Law 94-488 (90 Stat. 2341).
