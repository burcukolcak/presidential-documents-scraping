Message to the Congress Transmitting Final Report of the Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Personnel Policy.
To the Congress of the United States:
It is a privilege for me to transmit to the Congress the final report of the Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Personnel Policy.
This report, which supplements earlier work by the Council, addresses three issues of importance to Government at all levels: equal employment, labor management relations, and the development of work force policies by State and local governments. Because the members of the Council have expressed themselves forcefully and forthrightly on these matters, their work should serve as a useful reference point for public officials everywhere. All of us should be indebted to the Council members for their dedicated service and wisdom.
GERALD R. FORD

The White House,

September 25, 1974.
Note: The 63-page report is entitled "More Effective Public Service-The Supplementary Report to the President and the Congress by the Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Personnel Policy."
