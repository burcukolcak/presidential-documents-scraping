Death of Maryella Bayh Statement by the President. 
Rosalynn and I were deeply saddened by the death of Marvella Bayh, whose courage and candor in her 8-year battle against cancer served as an inspiration for all Americans. Maryella Bayh worked tirelessly to spread understanding of this dread disease and the importance of early detection of its warning signs. At this sad moment, our hearts go out to Senator Bayh and their son, Evan Bayh.
Note: On April 27, the President attended memorial services for Mrs. Bayh held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.
