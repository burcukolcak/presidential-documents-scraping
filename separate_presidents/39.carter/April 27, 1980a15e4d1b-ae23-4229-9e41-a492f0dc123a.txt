Hostages in the Dominican Republic Embassy in Bogota, Colombia Letter to Colombian President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala on the Release of the Hostages. 
Dear Mr. President:
I am deeply thankful that the siege at the Dominican Embassy has ended with the release of all the hostages. Your firm and patient leadership has achieved its goal: a dignified and peaceful solution. I am particularly grateful for your dedication to the hostages' safety and welfare during the long and delicate negotiations.
As you know, the United States unequivocally condemns all terrorists acts. I am pleased that our two governments have been able to work so closely together in this common struggle. A continued united effort by all governments is vital if terrorist violence around the world is to be curbed.

Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
Note: On February 27, Colombian terrorists seized the embassy and took as hostages 57 persons, most of whom were diplomats attending a reception there. Over a 61-day period, most of the hostages were released. On April 27, as the result of an agreement the Colombian Government negotiated with the terrorists, U.S. Ambassador to Colombia Diego C. Asencio and the remaining hostages were flown to Havana, Cuba, and released.
