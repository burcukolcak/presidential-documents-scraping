Federal Oil and Gas Leases in Wyoming Statement on Signing H. R. 2502 Into Law.
I have signed H.R. 2502, which extends for 4 years, 17 Federal oil and gas leases in Wyoming. The purpose of the extension is to permit the lessees the additional time needed to drill an ultradeep well. Technological problems have prevented the lessees from drilling that well to date.
I want to make clear that my signing this bill is not part of an overall policy favoring the extension of such leases, nor is my signing intended to affect in any way pending litigation on drilling extensions for certain Federal oil and gas leases.
By signing H.R. 2502, I am only accepting Congress judgment that the special circumstances surrounding these leases require a 4-year extension.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 2502 is Public Law 95-77, approved July 30.
