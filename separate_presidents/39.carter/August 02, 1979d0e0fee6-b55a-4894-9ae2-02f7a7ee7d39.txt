Memorandums From the President on Wild and Scenic Rivers and National Trails
Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
In my Environmental Message of August 2, 1979, I recognized the important natural, historic, and recreational values of our Nation's river corridors. It is important for the federal agencies to set an example of sound management for state, local, and private landowners by taking an aggressive role in protecting Wild and Scenic Rivers which flow through public lands.
In addition, I recognized that the 1968 National Trails System Act is designed to promote the development of recreational, scenic, and historic trails for persons of diverse interests and abilities—including the young, the handicapped, and the aged—and that the National Trails System is in its fledgling stage. The Act provides for designating trails on state, local and private lands, but only 130 trails have been established since enactment of the Act. In my Environmental Message I stressed the importance of expanding the National Trails System.
Therefore, I am directing that each of you take the following actions:
Please give these assignments your immediate attention.

Memorandum for the Secretary of Agriculture
In my Environmental Message of August 2, 1979, I recognized the important natural, historic, and recreational values of our Nation's river corridors. Unfortunately, development along the banks of our rivers continues to outpace our ability to identify and study those rivers which might qualify for protection under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Thus, we need to improve our techniques for identifying, and designating wild and scenic rivers.

I stressed the importance of expanding the National Trails System to provide increased recreation opportunities for the millions of Americans who enjoy hiking, backpacking, bicycling, and similar activities.

Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior
In my Environmental Message of August 2, 1979, I recognized the important natural, historic, and recreational values of our Nation's river corridors. Unfortunately, development along the banks of our rivers continues to outpace our ability to identify and study those rivers which might qualify for protection under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. This problem is particularly acute near urban areas, where there are greater demands for recreational opportunities. Thus, we need to improve our techniques for identifying, and designating wild and scenic rivers.

Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Board of the Tennessee Valley Authority
In my Environmental Message of August 2, 1979, I recognized that the 1968 National Trails System Act is designed to promote the development of recreational, scenic, and historic trails for persons of diverse interests and abilities—including the young, the handicapped, and the aged—and that National Trails System is in its fledgling stage. I stressed the importance of expanding the National Trails System to provide increased recreation opportunities for the millions of Americans who enjoy hiking, backpacking, and similar activities.
Therefore, I am directing each of you • to announce by January 1980 a goal for the number of National Recreation Trails each agency will establish during 1980 on the public lands administered by your agencies. By the end of 1980, I am directing that, at a minimum, 75 new National Recreation Trails shall be designated on these lands.
Please report your progress in meeting your goal to the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget on June 30, 1980 and on December 31, 1980.
