Federal Civil Service Reform Statement on Senate Passage of the Legislation. 
The Senate's overwhelming vote this evening in favor of civil service reform is a crucial victory in the battle to cut waste and make Government more efficient.
The Senators who supported my civil service reform proposal deserve the gratitude of every taxpayer in the United States. I particularly want to thank Senators Byrd, Ribicoff, and Percy. Their dedicated work was indispensable to passing a sound civil service reform bill.
Civil service reform is the centerpiece of my efforts to meet the clear demand of the American people for a responsive and streamlined Government. Because of the Senate's action tonight, we are one step closer to a Government that offers its own employees real incentives to do a good job while fully protecting their rights.
The next step is up to the House of Representatives, which will consider the legislation when it returns from Labor Day recess. I hope the House will act promptly, so that all of us can begin to realize the benefits of a well-managed Government.
