Pope John Paul I Message to His Holiness on His Election. 
Your Holiness:
On behalf of the American people, I join people the world over in welcoming your election as Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church. We rejoice in the renewal of leadership for your Church.
In a world of rapid change, the basic needs of humanity remain the same: peace, justice, equity and the opportunity for life with dignity. These are still the supreme challenges that face us. Your voice and your efforts, in the tradition of your predecessors, can be an inspiration and a hope for all those who struggle to meet those challenges. I pray it will be heard and echoed by people of good will throughout the world.
On this happy occasion, I extend to Your Holiness my deep respect and sincere good wishes for your Papacy.

Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
