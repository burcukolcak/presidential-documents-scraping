Presidential Campaign Debates of 1980 Telegram to the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the National Press Club. 
Dear Seth:
I am pleased to accept your invitation to a one-on-one debate with Governor Reagan at the National Press Club. I believe that the earliest possible date would be preferable so that the maximum number of debates can be scheduled. Members of my campaign staff are ready to discuss format and timing immediately. I look forward to this debate as the beginning of a constructive cross-examination of the candidates by members of the press.

Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
[Mr. Seth T. Payne, Chairman, Board of Governors, National Press Club, Room 809, National Press Building, Washington, D.C.]
Attention: Mr. Peter A. Holmes
