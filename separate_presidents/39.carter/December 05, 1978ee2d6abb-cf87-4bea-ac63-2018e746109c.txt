Airplane Crash in Alaska Statement on the Incident Involving Senator and Mrs. Ted Stevens of Alaska and Others. 
Rosalynn and I were shocked to learn of the tragic plane crash in Alaska yesterday which claimed the lives of five people, including Mrs. Ted Stevens. We join the families of Senator Stevens and Tony Motley in praying for their quick recovery, and we extend to Senator Stevens' family and the families of Richard Sykes, Richard Church, Joe Rudd, and Clarence Kramer our deepest sympathies for their loss.
