Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center Statement on Signing S.J. Res. 213 Into Law. 
I have today signed S.J. Res. 213, a bill designating the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health as the "Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center."
This act is an appropriate tribute to the long and distinguished career of Senator Magnuson, who has been a leader in the cause of better health care for Americans. He has been called the "Commander in Chief" of the war against cancer and heart disease. In 1937 as a freshman Member of the House of Representatives, he sponsored the legislation creating the National Cancer Institute. He has had an unwavering commitment to the idea that progress in health care depends on research and has through his many years of public office contributed substantially to the excellence of health research in the United States.
Note: As enacted, S.J. Res. 213 is Public Law 96-518, approved December 12.
