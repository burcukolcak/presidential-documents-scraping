National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws and Procedures Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate,
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President :)
On November 30, 1977, I signed an Executive Order establishing a National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws and Procedures. A copy of the Order is enclosed.
The Commission, will study and make recommendations on legislative or other proposals for expediting complex antitrust cases and making the remedies in such cases more effective, and on the desirability of retaining the various exemptions and immunities from the antitrust laws. The Commission shall conclude its work within six months and submit its final report to the Attorney General and me within thirty days after completing its work.
By the terms of the Executive Order, I must appoint three of the Commission's fifteen members upon your recommendation. I would appreciate your providing me with your recommendations at an early date, by submitting the names to the Attorney General.
I believe it is essential that our antitrust enforcement efforts not be allowed to become outdated or inefficient. This Commission will have the important responsibility of helping to ensure that this does not occur.
I wish to thank you in advance for your kind cooperation.

Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
