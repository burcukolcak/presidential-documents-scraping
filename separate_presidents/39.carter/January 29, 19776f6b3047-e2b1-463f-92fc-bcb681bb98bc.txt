Natural Gas Emergency Text of a Telegram to the Governors of 12 States.
I am deeply concerned about the human suffering and economic problems being caused by the energy shortages.
To help deal with these problems, I would appreciate your providing me specific information on energy related problems in your state, and your views as to how these problems could be mitigated or resolved. I have asked Jack Watson, Secretary to the Cabinet and the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Relations, to coordinate the efforts of an interagency group that will collect such information and oversee the federal response to this serious problem.
Please telegraph your response att: Jack Watson/Coordinating Group/White House, D.C.
