National Heart, Blood Vessel, Lung, and Blood Program Message to the Congress Transmitting an Annual Report.
To the Congress of the United States:

I am transmitting herewith a copy of the Fourth Report of the Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, prepared in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 413(b)(2) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by Public Law 94-278. The report contains two funding plans which have been generated by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Both of these proposed levels are substantially in excess of my current budget request for 1978. While the research conducted by this Institute is of great importance, there are a large number of competing urgent national needs. Individual program activities and funding levels must be carefully considered not only on the basis of individual program merit, but also in light of overall resource availability and fiscal policy.
