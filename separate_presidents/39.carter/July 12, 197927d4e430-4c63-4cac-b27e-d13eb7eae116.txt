Memorandum From the President on the Combined Federal Campaign
Memorandum for Heads of Departments and Agencies
It is a pleasure to announce The Honorable Bob Bergland, Secretary of Agriculture, has agreed to serve as Chairman of the Combined Federal Campaign for the National Capital Area this fall.
The solicitation efforts of the United Way of the National Capital Area, the National Health Agencies, and the International Service Agencies are combined into a single drive to meet the needs of more than 150 local, national, and international health, welfare, and social service agencies in this one drive.
These organizations deserve our wholehearted support, to enable them to provide assistance to our neighbors and friends who have special needs. By working through the Combined Federal Campaign we can provide the voluntary agencies a beacon of hope for providing the needed assistance.
The Combined Federal Campaign offers a unique opportunity through a once a year giftâ€”a pledge made easier through the use of voluntary payroll deductions-for Federal personnel to help persons in our community, in our Nation, and in overseas lands. I am confident Mr. Bergland will have your wholehearted support in this endeavor. Additionally, I hope you will commend the campaign with its payroll deduction feature to Federal employees and military personnel in your organization.
I request that you serve personally as Chairman of the Combined Federal Campaign in your organization and appoint one of your top assistants as your Vice Chairman. Please advise Mr. Bergland of the person you designate as your Vice Chairman.
