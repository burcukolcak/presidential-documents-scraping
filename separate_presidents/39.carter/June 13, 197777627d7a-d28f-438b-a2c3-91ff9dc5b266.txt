Tom C. Clark Statement on the Death of the Former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
With the death of retired Supreme Court Justice Tom C. Clark, the Nation has lost a devoted jurist, and the legal profession has lost a tireless and perceptive advocate of judicial reform.
Tom Clark's public career spanned exactly half a century. He will be remembered for his participation in Supreme Court decisions that helped shape the attitudes and outlook of our times. In retirement, he traveled widely and spoke eloquently of the need to make the Federal judiciary more responsive and efficient. His candor and his good will are certain to be missed. I extend my sincerest sympathy to his wife and family.
Note: Tom C. Clark served as an Associate Justice from 1949 to 1967.
