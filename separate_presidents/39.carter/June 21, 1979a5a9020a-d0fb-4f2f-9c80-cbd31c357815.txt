Panama Canal Treaties Statement on House of Representatives Approval of Legislation To Implement the Treaties. 
The House of Representatives today passed vital legislation providing for our management and defense of the Panama Canal. I deeply appreciate both the courage of all those Members who recognized the national interests by voting for this legislation and the effective leadership of Jim Wright, Jack Murphy, John Bradcross, David Bowen, and the statesmanship of Ed Derwinski, who shepherded the bill to passage.
Improvements in the bill are still needed to make certain that the legislation is fully consistent with our commitments under the Panama Canal Treaty. We will be seeking those improvements as the legislative process continues. I am looking forward to early Senate action and a quick conference that will ensure our ability to maintain and defend the canal.
Note: Press Secretary Jody Powell read the statement at 3:05 p.m. to reporters assembled in the Briefing Room at the White House.
Also included in the press release is a question-and-answer session with reporters.
