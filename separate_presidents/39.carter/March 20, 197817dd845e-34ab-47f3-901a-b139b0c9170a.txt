Golda Meir Letter to the Former Israeli Prime Minister. 
Dear Mrs. Melt:
I was alarmed to learn today of your illness and relieved to hear that you are resting comfortably. Your strength, courage, and humanity have been an inspiration to our people and we look upon you with deep affection and admiration. Rosalynn joins me in sending our very best wishes for a swift and complete recovery.

Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
