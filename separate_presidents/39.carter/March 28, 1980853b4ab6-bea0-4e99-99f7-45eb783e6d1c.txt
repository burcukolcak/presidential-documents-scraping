Federal Trade Commission Statement on Signing H.J. Res. 514 Into Law. 
The failure over the last 3 years to provide the Federal Trade Commission with an authorization has seriously disrupted the important consumer protection and antitrust activities of the agency and has caused great uncertainty for its 1,700 employees.
I expect and hope that the House-Senate conference, now meeting, would complete its work on a new authorization bill before this latest continuing resolution expires. I reiterate the commitment that I have previously made not to allow this agency to be picked to pieces by special interests and underscore my intention to veto any bill which cripples the ability of the FTC to protect the consumers of this country.
Note: As enacted, H.J. Res. 514 is Public Law 96-219, approved March 28.
