Investigation of Hamilton Jordan Statement by the President. 
My confidence in Hamilton Jordan's integrity has never wavered. I am gratified that after an exhaustive investigation the Special Prosecutor and the grand jury have now agreed with the Attorney General's conclusion last fall that the charges against Hamilton have not been substantiated.
Note: Special Prosecutor Arthur H. Christy concluded in a report that there was insufficient evidence to support allegations that Mr. Jordan, Assistant to the President, had used cocaine in a New York disco in June 1978 or in Los Angeles in October 1977.
