Gasoline Conservation Fee Letter to the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader. 
Dear Mr. Speaker (Dear Mr. Leader)
This is to reemphasize my long standing position that I cannot sign any bill disapproving the gasoline conservation fee which I imposed April 2, 1980.
Thus I shall immediately veto any debt limit extension or other legislation that disallows the fee or that restricts my authority to impose such a fee.

Sincerely,
JIMMY CARTER
