Special Central American Assistance Act of 1979 Statement on Signing H.R. 6081 Into Law. 
I am pleased to sign into law the authorizing legislation for the Special Central American Assistance Act. The countries of Central America need U.S. assistance to improve the well-being of their people and to strengthen their ability to withstand interference from abroad. Nowhere is this need more urgent than in Nicaragua. This legislation reaffirms our commitment to assist in democratic development in Nicaragua and our determination to meet the Cuban challenge throughout the Central American region.
The United States provided substantial emergency assistance to the Nicaraguan Government and people immediately after the revolution. Through the Special Central American Assistance Act, we can now offer significant help in reconstructing the Nicaraguan economy and in rebuilding Nicaragua's active private sector. Through it, we demonstrate our sympathy with the aspirations of the Nicaraguan people for a better life and our desire to cooperate with those governments that share our interest in pluralism and democracy. This legislation will signal to the Cubans and others who might wish to interfere in Central America that the United States intends to resist their efforts throughout the region in order to support the forces of democracy.
The passage of the Central American Assistance Act will help to accelerate the pace of reconstruction in Nicaragua, promote mutual understanding between our two countries, and improve the prospects for progressive, peaceful solutions to problems in Central America.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 6081 is Public Law 96-257, approved May 31.
