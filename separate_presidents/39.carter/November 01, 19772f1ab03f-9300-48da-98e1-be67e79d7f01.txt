International Labor Organization Statement on the Termination of U.S. Membership.
Two years ago, the United States gave official notice that we would leave the International Labor Organization unless corrective measures were taken to restore that organization's commitment to its original purposes. Because such measures have not been taken, I direct that United States membership in ILO be terminated. The United States remains ready to return whenever the ILO is again true to its proper principles and procedures.
Note: Secretary of Labor F. Ray Marshall read the statement at a news conference at the White House on November I. It was not issued in the form of a White House press release.
