Retirement Pay for Marine Corps Sergeants Major Statement on Signing H.R. 10343 Into Law. 
H.R. 10343 authorizes a change in the calculation of retirement pay for two retired Marine Corps Sergeants Major, so that they will be treated in the same manner as all other retired senior enlisted advisers of the military services. I view the bill as exceptional private relief legislation meant to remedy an anomaly in existing law and as having no precedential value. On that basis I have decided to approve the bill.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 10343 is Public Law 95-581, approved November 2.
