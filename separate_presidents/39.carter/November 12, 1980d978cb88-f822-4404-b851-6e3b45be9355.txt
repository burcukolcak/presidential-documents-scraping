Science and Technology Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report. 
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to the Congress the Second Annual Science and Technology Report as required by the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976.
The events and issues discussed in this report—and in its companion report, the Five-Year Outlook on Science and Technology—show how closely government policies and developments in science and technology are connected. Careful and systematic assessment of scientific and technological developments remains crucial to the formation of effective public policy.
I hope that this report, like its predecessor, will contribute to the informed discussion so necessary to the maintenance of our scientific and technological capabilities.
JIMMY CARTER
