Death of Steven J. Crowley Statement by the President. 
Marine Corporal Steven J. Crowley's death is a tragic loss and a stark reminder of the dangers the men and women of our Armed Forces face in the service of their Nation.

On behalf of all Americans, I extend my heartfelt sympathy to Steven Crowley's family and to the U.S. Marine Corps.
Note: Corporal Crowley, of Port Jefferson, N.Y., was killed during a mob attack on the American Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan.
