Veterans Disability Compensation and Survivor Benefits Act of 1977 Statement on Signing H.R. 1862 Into Law.
I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 1862, a bill which will provide a 6.6 percent increase in compensation payments for over 2 million disabled veterans and their survivors. These increases will become effective Saturday, October 1, 1977.
The enactment of H.R. 1862 carries out my recommendation that compensation payments be adjusted this year to keep pace with the cost of living.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 1862 is Public Law 95-117, approved October 3.
