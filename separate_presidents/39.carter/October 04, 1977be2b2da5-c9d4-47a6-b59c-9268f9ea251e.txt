Natural Gas Deregulation Statement on Senate Action.
This legislation is unacceptable. It is an injustice to the working people of this country.
The bill passed by the House is a fair one and one that I and the American people can support. I hope and expect that a reasonable bill will emerge from the conference committee and be approved by both Houses.
I look forward to signing legislation that provides adequate production incentives while protecting the interests of American consumers. I will not sign an unfair bill.
Note: Earlier in the day, the Senate had passed H.R. 5289, a bill to establish a comprehensive natural gas pricing policy.
The statement was made available by the White House Press Office. It was not issued in the form of a White House press release.
