Statement on the Recess Appointments of Five Members of the Board of Directors of the Synthetic Fuels Corporation
Although we continue to make progress in reducing America's dependence on foreign sources of oil, the current conflict in the Persian Gulf region serves as a reminder of our need to achieve energy independence without delay. Therefore, I am today announcing the recess appointments of five members of the Board of Directors of the Synthetic Fuels Corporation. I am taking this action because the United States Senate failed to confirm these nominees before it adjourned last week. A number of congressional leaders, including Senator Robert Byrd and Senator Henry Jackson, have encouraged me to proceed with recess appointments.
The Synthetic Fuels Corporation can now begin immediately its work to design, build, and operate plants which will convert coal, shale, tar sands, and other American natural resources into synthetic fuels. This corporation for energy security is the cornerstone of our national energy policy.
I urge the Senate to move quickly to confirm each of these recess appointments when it reconvenes in November.
Note: On the same day, the President announced the recess appointments of John C. Sawhill, Lane Kirkland, Frank Savage, Catherine B. Gleary, and John D. DeButts as members of the Board of Directors of the Synthetic Fuels Corporation. For the announcements of their nominations, see pages 1700 and 1717 of this series.
