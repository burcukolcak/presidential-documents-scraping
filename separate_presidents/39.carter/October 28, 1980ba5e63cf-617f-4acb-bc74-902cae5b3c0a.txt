Jimmy Carter
October 28, 1980

Cleveland, Ohio Remarks at a Carter/Mondale Rally. 
Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking— [laughter] —I find myself called upon tonight to substitute for my good friends, John Glenn and Bob Strauss, who are out educating the press about what took place in the debate just a few minutes ago. [Laughter] I thought it was a very fine opportunity for me and Governor Reagan to sharply draw a distinction between the Republicans and Democrats—history, and a distortion of history; the control of nuclear weapons, and an absence of commitment to control of nuclear weapons. Equal rights for all Americans, a secure nation, peace—these are the kinds of things that were discussed quite thoroughly.
Now, as I said in my closing statement, we've got another week to go. Next Tuesday the decision will be not in the hands of debate judges or the League of Women Voters or the press, the decision will be in the hands of millions of Americans, like you, around this Nation. And I want to ask you: Are you with me? [Applause] and cheers Are we going to win? [Applause] and cheers Are you going to work this next week? [Applause and cheers] We'll have a tremendous victory on November the 4th. Thanks to you, I don't have any doubt about it.
Good luck. God bless you for a greater America.
Note: The President spoke at 11:30 p.m. in the Grand Ballroom at the Bond Court Hotel.
