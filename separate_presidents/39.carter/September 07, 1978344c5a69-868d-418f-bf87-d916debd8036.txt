Department of Defense Appropriation Authorization Bill Statement on the House of Representatives Action To Sustain the President's Veto of H.R. 10929. 
I am very pleased by the decision of the House to sustain my veto of the defense authorization bill. I now look forward to working closely and cooperatively with the appropriate committees of the House and Senate in enacting a new bill which will provide the strongest possible national defense, a goal which I know we all share.
