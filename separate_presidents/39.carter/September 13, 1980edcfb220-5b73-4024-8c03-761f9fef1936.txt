American Hostages in Iran Informal Exchange With Reporters. 
REPORTER. What did you think about the concert?
THE PRESIDENT. I enjoyed it.
Q. What was your favorite song?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think "Georgia."
Q. Why?
Q. What did you think of the comment by Mr. Reagan tonightâ€”that we should accept three of the four proposals from the Ayatollah?
THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think it's better not to get involved, in the political campaign, with the Iranian situation.
Q. Thank you very much.
Note: The exchange began at 11:08 p.m. at the South Portico at the White House, following the President's return from Columbia, Md., where he attended a concert by Willie Nelson and a Carter/Mondale reception.
