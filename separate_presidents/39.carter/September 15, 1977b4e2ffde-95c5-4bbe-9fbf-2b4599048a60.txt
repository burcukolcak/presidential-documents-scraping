Meeting With Nobusuke Kishi of Japan Remarks at a Meeting With the Former Prime Minister.
Just for the benefit of the news media, this is one of the great leaders in the free world.
Prime Minister Kishi was courageous enough to support a friendship with our own country at a time when it was not popular for him to do so.
He's been instrumental in some of the finest international efforts that related' to the well-being of humans throughout the world. And although he's had a lot of years on Earth and a lot of experience, he's still young at heart.
It's a great honor for us to have him here in the United States.
Note: The President spoke at 3:15 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House.
