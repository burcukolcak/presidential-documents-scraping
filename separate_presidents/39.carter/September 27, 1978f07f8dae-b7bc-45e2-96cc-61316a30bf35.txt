National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report. 
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to submit to the Congress the first annual report on science and technology as required by the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976.
Science and technology contribute in significant ways to many of our social needs—maintaining economic growth and productivity, feeding the world's people, improving our health and environment, and preserving our national security. They also reveal the basic structure of nature. Moreover, our science and technology draw the respect and admiration of nations throughout the world.
I believe this report, and its successors, can play an important role in providing a foundation for informed debate on scientific and technological issues, and thereby can help assure that our scientific and technological capabilities remain strong.
JIMMY CARTER
