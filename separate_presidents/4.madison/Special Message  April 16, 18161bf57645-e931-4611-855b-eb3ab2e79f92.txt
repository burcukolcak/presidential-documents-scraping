Special Message 
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I lay before Congress copies of a convention concluded between the United States and the Cherokee Indians on the 2d day of March last, as the same has been duly ratified and proclaimed; and I recommend that such provision be made by Congress as the stipulations therein contained may require.
JAMES MADISON.
