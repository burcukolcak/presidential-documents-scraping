Special Message
The PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES.
SIR: The destruction of the Capitol by the enemy having made it necessary that other accommodations should be provided for the meeting of Congress, chambers for the Senate and for the House of Representatives, with other requisite apartments, have been fitted up, under the direction of the superintendent of the city, in the public building heretofore allotted for the post and other public offices.
With this information, be pleased, sir, to accept assurances of my great respect and consideration.
JAMES MADISON.
