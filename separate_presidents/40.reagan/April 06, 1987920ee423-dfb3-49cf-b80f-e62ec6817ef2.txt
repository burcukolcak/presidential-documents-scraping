Informal Exchange With Reporters on Acid Rain 
Q. Mr. President, if it's going to take millions of dollars of investment and thousands of jobs to clean up the acid rain, doesn't it make sense to start now?
The President. We would like to feel that we started quite some time ago. We'd like to improve our record on what we're trying to do.
Q. Are you still opposed to a treaty, though?

The President. What?
Q. Are you still opposed to a treaty, though?
The President. I'm not saying one way or the other. We're still discussing the issue.
Q. In principle, do you think some firmer sort of agreement signed between the two countries is called for?
The President. I don't know whether it's more agreements. I think we're all agreed on cleaning up the air as we have cleaned up the water.
Note: The exchange began at 12:25 p.m. prior to a luncheon at Prime Minister Mulroney's residence. In the morning, the President met with John Turner, leader of the opposition party, in the Drawing Room at Rideau Hall and with Prime Minister Mulroney in his office at Parliament Hill.
