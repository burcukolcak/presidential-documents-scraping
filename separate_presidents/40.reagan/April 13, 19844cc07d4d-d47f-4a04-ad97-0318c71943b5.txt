Proclamation 5178â€”Asian / Pacific American Heritage Week, 1984

The great strength of America lies in the determination and caring hearts of our people. Reflecting diverse backgrounds and the experiences of all our citizens, this Nation is a hearty amalgam of individuals united in their commitment to freedom.
Americans who have come from Asian and Pacific countries have added a special quality to the United States. They have made outstanding contributions to our Nation's progress in a wide range of fields, including science, the arts, medicine, law, literature, agriculture, industry and commerce, and government. Bringing with them the strong and varied traditions and heritages of their Asian and Pacific homelands, they have greatly enriched America's culture and institutions.
This Nation owes a debt of gratitude to the Asian and Pacific immigrants. Their desire for liberty strengthens and underscores our own.
As we celebrate the accomplishments of Asian and Pacific Americans, we dedicate ourselves to overcoming the legacy of past discrimination, knowing that the struggle for full participation and equal opportunity goes on. We are grateful to Asian and Pacific Americans for their enduring belief in the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 5, 1984, as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week and call upon all the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this 13th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyfour, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
