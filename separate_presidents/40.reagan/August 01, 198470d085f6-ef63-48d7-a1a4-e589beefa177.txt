Informal Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Archbishop Pio Laghi, Apostolic Delegate to the United States 
The President. You, of course, know who our guest is. I don't have to tell you. And we're very pleased and proud to have him here.
Q. Mr. President, do you think Poland went far enough in its amnesty so that you can lift some of the sanctions?
The President. These are the things that we're going to discuss today.
Q. Mr. President, the Soviets say that your position has made it impossible to meet in Vienna next September.
The President. Well, you've had a press conference on that and have heard what my statement was.
Q. What do you have to say about it? What do you tell them?
The President. No, I'm not going to take any questions on that at a photo opportunity.
Q. Is there anything you can do to get them there?

The President. What?
Q. Is there anything you can do to get them to Vienna?
The President. We're doing everything we can.
Q. Thank you, sir.

The President. I'm not going to comment on those things here. We're here to talk with our visitor about another situation. All right?
Q. Thank you.
