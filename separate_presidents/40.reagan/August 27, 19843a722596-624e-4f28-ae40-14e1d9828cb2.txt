Statement on Signing a Bill Establishing the Martin Luther King, Jr. Federal Holiday Commission 
I have today signed H.R. 5890, which establishes a temporary commission to encourage and advise on appropriate observances of the first legal holiday commemorating the birth of Martin Luther King, Jr., which will occur on January 20, 1986.
The Commission can make a significant contribution by assisting governmental and private organizations in arranging for appropriate ceremonies to honor this great and distinguished man.
I have been advised by the Attorney General that, in view of the requirements of the appointments and the incompatibility clauses of the Constitution, a majority of the members of the Commission, and therefore the Commission itself, may perform only ceremonial and advisory functions.
Note: As enacted, H.R. 5890 is Public Law 98-399, approved August 27.
