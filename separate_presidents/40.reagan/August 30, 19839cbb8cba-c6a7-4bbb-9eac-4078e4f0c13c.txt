Message to Captain Richard H. Truly and the Crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger 
I wish you and the crew of the Challenger Godspeed on your historic journey. Like those other select Americans who at heroic risk to themselves traveled into space before you, you will have the minds and hearts of your fellow countrymen—and of the world—with you.
Nancy joins me in prayer for your historic mission and homecoming. God bless you.
