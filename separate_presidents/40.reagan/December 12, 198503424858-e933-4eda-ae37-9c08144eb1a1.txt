Statement on the Crash of an Airliner Transporting Members of the 101st Airborne Division 
Nancy and I are deeply shocked and saddened by the report of the tragic crash of a chartered airliner returning U.S. troops to the United States from peacekeeping duty with the United Nations' Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai. The loss, tragic at any time, is especially painful at this holiday period. I have been advised by the Secretary of Defense that the full resources of the U.S. Army and the U.S. Government are being made available to assist families of victims however possible. Our hearts go out to the loved ones of these brave soldiers who have paid the fullest price in the service of their country and the cause of peace.
Note: Larry M. Speakes, Principal Deputy Press Secretary to the President, read the President's statement to reporters in the Briefing Room at the White House during his daily press briefing, which began at noon. The airliner, which was en route to Fort Campbell, KY, crashed at 6:45 a.m. in Gander, Newfoundland. There were 248 casualties.
