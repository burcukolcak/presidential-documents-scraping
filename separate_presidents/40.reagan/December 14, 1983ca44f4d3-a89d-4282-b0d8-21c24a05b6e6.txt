Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate Reporting on United States Participation in the Multinational Force in Lebanon 
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am providing herewith a further report with respect to the situation in Lebanon and the participation of the United States Armed Forces in the Multinational Force. This report, prepared by the Secretaries of State and Defense, is consistent with Section 4 of the Multinational Force in Lebanon Resolution. This report also includes the information called for by the House version of the Resolution and is submitted in accordance with its more restrictive time limits.
I remain convinced that Congressional support for our continued participation in the Multinational Force is critical to peace, national reconciliation, and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon. We will, of course, keep you informed as to further developments with respect to this situation.

Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
