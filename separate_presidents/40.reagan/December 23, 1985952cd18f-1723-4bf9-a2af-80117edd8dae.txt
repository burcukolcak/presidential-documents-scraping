Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate Transmitting a Report on Soviet Noncompliance With Arms Control Agreements 
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In response to Congressional requests as set forth in Public Law 99-145, I am forwarding herewith classified and unclassified versions of the Administration's report to the Congress on Soviet Noncompliance with Arms Control Agreements.
Detailed classified briefings will be available to the Congress early in the new year.
I believe the additional information provided, and issues addressed, especially in the detailed classified report, will significantly increase understanding of Soviet violations and probable violations. Such understanding, and strong Congressional consensus on the importance of compliance to achieving effective arms control, will do much to strengthen our efforts both in seeking corrective actions and in negotiations with the Soviet Union.

Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House of Representatives, and George Bush, President of the Senate. The original was not available for verification of the content. The text of the President's unclassified report was included in the White House press release.
