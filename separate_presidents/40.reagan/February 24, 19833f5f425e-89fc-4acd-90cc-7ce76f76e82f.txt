Statement on Senate Committee Action on the Nomination of Kenneth L. Adelman To Be Director of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency 
While I would have greatly preferred a positive confirmation vote, I am pleased that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today voted to report to the full Senate the nomination of Kenneth Adelman to head the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. I am fully committed to his nomination, and I share Howard Baker's assessment that the Senate will confirm him.
