Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate Reporting on the NATO Chemical Deterrent Posture 
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to the FY 1986 Department of Defense Authorization Act, P.L. 99-145, Sec. 1411(e), I am reporting to you the results of consultations among North Atlantic Treaty Organization member nations concerning the organization's chemical deterrent posture.
The attached classified report outlines the ongoing consultative process in NATO. I am confident that we are making steady progress, and that with your continued strong support to fund chemical deterrent and defensive programs, the United States can do its share to strengthen Alliance security.

Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
Note: Identical letters were sent to Jim Wright, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and George Bush, President of the Senate.
