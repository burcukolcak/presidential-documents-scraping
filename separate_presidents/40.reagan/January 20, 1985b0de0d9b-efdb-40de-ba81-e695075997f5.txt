Ronald Reagan
January 20, 1985

Oaths of Office Taken by the President and the Vice President at the White House Swearing-in Ceremony 
Oath Administered to the Vice President by Potter Stewart, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States:
I, George Herbert Walker Bush, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter, so help me God.
Oath Administered to the President by Warren E. Burger, Chief Justice of the United States:
I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, so help me God.
Note: The private swearing-in ceremony began at 11:50 a.m. on the landing of the Grand Staircase on the State Floor at the White House. The ceremony was attended by immediate members of the Reagan and Bush families, members of the Cabinet and the senior White House staff, and bipartisan congressional leaders.
The 20th amendment to the Constitution requires that the President be sworn in on January 20; however, because the date fell on a Sunday, the public inauguration ceremony was held at the Capitol on the following day.
