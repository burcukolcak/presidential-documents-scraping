Letter to President Corazon C. Aquino on the Internal Situation in the Philippines 
Dear Madame President:
The sober and peaceful approach you have taken to deal with the political incident that took place in Manila this weekend is greatly admired. Once again, your leadership has shown the world the mettle of your government and the degree of support it enjoys among your people.
I look forward to meeting with you in Washington in September.

Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
