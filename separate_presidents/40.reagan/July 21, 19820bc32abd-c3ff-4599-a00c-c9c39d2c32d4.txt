Statement on House of Representatives Approval of Funds for Production of the MX Missile 
I am most gratified by today's House vote approving funds for production of the MX missile. This strong, bipartisan action demonstrates clearly the commitment of the Congress to improving America's defenses, thereby providing important support for Ambassador [Edward L.] Rowny in his negotiations with the Soviet Union on strategic arms reductions. I look forward to working with House and Senate conferees to ensure final passage of the MX authorization.
