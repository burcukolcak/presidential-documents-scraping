Statement on the Death of King Khalid of Saudi Arabia 
I was deeply grieved to learn of the death of His Majesty King Khalid of Saudi Arabia, who ruled his country with honor, dignity, and wisdom, and whose goodness and understanding commanded the respect of all. I extend my personal condolences and sympathy, as well as those of the American people, to His Majesty King Fahd, the Royal Family, and the people of Saudi Arabia, a country with which we have enjoyed more than a half-century of warm, constructive, and mutually beneficial relations.
Note: On June 14, the White House announced that the President asked the Vice President to lead a high-level delegation to Saudi Arabia that evening to pay the respects of the United States to the late King. The delegation, in addition to the Vice President, would include Secretary of Defense Caspar W Weinberger, Senator Charles H. Percy of Illinois, Senator J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Representative William S. Broomfield of Michigan, Representative Clement J. Zablocki of Wisconsin, Gen. Lew Allen, Jr., Air Force Chief of Staff Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Robert C. McFarlane, and Joseph Twinam, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs.
