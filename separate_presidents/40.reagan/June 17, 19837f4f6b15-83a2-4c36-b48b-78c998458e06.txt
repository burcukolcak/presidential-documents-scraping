Letter to Yuriy Andropov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union 
Dear Mr. President:
Please accept my congratulations upon your election as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
As you assume your new duties, I hope that together we can find ways to promote peace by reducing the levels of armaments and moving toward the elimination of force and threats of force in settling international disputes. You will have my full cooperation in moving toward these goals on a basis of equality, reciprocity, and respect for the rights and interests of all.

Sincerely,
RONALD REAGAN
