Statement on the Death of Three Secret Service Agents in California 
It was with profound sadness and sorrow that I learned of the tragic deaths of three special agents of the United States Secret Service who gave their lives today in the service of their country. Pat LaBarge, Don Bejcek, and Don Robinson were professionals in every sense of the wordâ€”men whose duty required the utmost in courage and dedication. Nancy and I extend our deepest sympathy to their wives, children, and families.
Note: The agents were killed in an automobile accident as they were traveling to Yosemite National Park, Calif, to join a detail assigned to protect Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Prince Philip during their visit there.
