Proclamation 5647—Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week, 1987

Like all Americans, those of Asian and Pacific descent share twin heritages—the rich cultural legacy of the lands of their forebears and the liberty that is the birthright of every American. Drawing on the values and traditions of their homelands and the promise of this land of opportunity, Asian and Pacific Americans have long helped build and strengthen our Nation. They have also gallantly defended our country and our freedom in time of war.
Through the years, many of the indelible contributions by Asian and Pacific Americans to our land have come from immigrants. These quiet heroes and heroines have known oppression and poverty in their native lands and have courageously struggled to reach the United States and make a new life for themselves and their children. Their story is America's story, and their spirit is America's spirit.
Every American can be profoundly grateful for the achievements of Asian and Pacific Americans. Their hard work, creativity, and intelligence have inspired their fellow citizens and added new dimensions to our national life.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 3, 1987, as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof,I have hereunto set my hand this 4th day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyseven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
