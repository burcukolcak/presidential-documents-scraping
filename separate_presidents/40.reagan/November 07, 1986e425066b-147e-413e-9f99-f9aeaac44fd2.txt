Statement on Signing the Bill Establishing the Dwight D. Eisenhower Centennial Commission 
I am pleased to approve H.R. 4302, which establishes the Dwight David Eisenhower Centennial Commission. The Commission will encourage, plan, and coordinate observances of the centennial of President Eisenhower's birth, which will occur on October 14, 1990.

In order to avoid significant concerns under both the Incompatibility and Appointments Clauses of the Constitution, I am construing the functions of this Commission to be solely advisory.
Note: H.R. 4302, approved November 7, was assigned Public Law No. 99-624.
