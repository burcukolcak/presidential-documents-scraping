Remarks to Reporters Announcing the Appointment of Ambassador Philip C. Habib as the President's Special Representative for the Middle East 
The President. I'll be answering your questions tonight, of course. But I want you to know here that I've asked Ambassador Habib to be my representative in the Middle East and take charge there. Ambassadors Fairbanks and Draper will continue to serve under him as we continue on the Middle East policy. And he's going to be in charge of that as well as the continued pursuit of overall peace in the Middle East and—as well as stabilizing the situation in Lebanon, and he has agreed to do that.
Q. Is it because everything is stalemated there that they need the big man to go back?
The President. Well, let's just say it's always worked better when he's there.
Ambassador Habib. The President asked me to take a few questions in the other room—
Q. Where specifically will Mr. Habib return? Where specifically will Mr. Habib go to?
Ambassador Habib. I'm going to take your questions in the next room, so why don't I take care of it that way?
Note: The President spoke at 1:31 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White House following a meeting with Ambassador Habib, Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs William P Clark, and other administration officials.
