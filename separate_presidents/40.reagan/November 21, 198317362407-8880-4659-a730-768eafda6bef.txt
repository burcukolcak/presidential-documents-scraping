Statement on Signing a Bill To Commemorate the Centennial of the Birth of Eleanor Roosevelt 
I have signed today S.J. Res. 139, a joint resolution which is designed to commemorate the centennial of the birth of Eleanor Roosevelt.
This centennial offers an opportunity to honor one of the great First Ladies of this country whose contributions to humanity were not limited to her stay in the White House but continued thereafter on a worldwide basis.
I have been advised by the Attorney General that in view of the requirements of the appointments and the incompatibility clauses of the Constitution, a majority of the members of the Commission, and therefore the Commission itself, may perform only ceremonial and advisory functions.
Note: As enacted, S.J. Res. 139 is Public Law 98-162, approved November 21.
