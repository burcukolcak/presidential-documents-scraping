Statement on the Death of Bess Truman 
Bess Truman lived a long, full life, serving her husband, her family, and her country with dignity. She was a devoted wife, a loving mother, and a gracious, unassuming First Lady. Bess Truman embodied the basic decency of America. Nancy and I convey our deepest sympathy to her family and to all who will miss this fine lady's goodness.
Note: The widow of President Harry S. Truman died in Independence, Mo., at the age of 97.
On October 20 the White House announced that Mrs. Reagan would attend funeral services for Mrs. Truman in Independence on October 21. The White House also announced that the President telephoned Margaret Truman Daniel to express his condolences on the death of her mother.
