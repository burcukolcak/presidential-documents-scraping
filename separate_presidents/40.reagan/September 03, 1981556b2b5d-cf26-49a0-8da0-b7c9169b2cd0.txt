Exchange With a Reporter on Defense Spending 
Reporter. Mr. President, Secretary Weinberger says that he does not expect there to be cuts of $30 billion in the defense budget. Do you expect them to be at that magnitude?
The President. All I know is that no department is going to be exempt, but we are not retreating from our program of building up our defenses.

Reporter. Thank you.
Note: The exchange took place on the South Lawn of the White House at 2:18 p.m. as the President returned from his stay in California.
