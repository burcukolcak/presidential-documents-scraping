Letter to Israeli President Chaim Herzog on the Massacre at Neve Shalom Synagogue in Istanbul, Turkey 
Dear Mr. President,

The dreadful murder of twenty-three Jewish worshippers, including an Israeli Rabbi, at the Neve Shalom Synagogue in Istanbul yesterday has deeply shocked and saddened all Americans. Our hearts cry out for those innocent people who died and for their families.
This savage act, like the hijacking of the Pan American aircraft in Karachi which ended in tragedy, is a reminder that terrorism remains a constant threat to civilized mankind. All nations and people who value human decency must continue the struggle to end such outrages against society. I join you in sorrow and sympathy.

Sincerely,

/ S / RONALD REAGAN
