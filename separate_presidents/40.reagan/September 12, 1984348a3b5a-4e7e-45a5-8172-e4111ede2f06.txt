Memorandum on the Combined Federal Campaign 
Memorandum for All Federal Employees and Military Personnel
In each of the past 23 years, Federal employees and members of the Armed Forces have had the opportunity to show their concern for those in need through participation in the Combined Federal Campaign. I ask each of you now to continue that tradition of voluntary sharing.
Through the Combined Federal Campaign, we can help relieve pain and health problems now and support research to help eliminate them in the future. We can help our neighbors without making them dependent on government. We can assist the less fortunate in other countries, extending a nurturing hand to friends around the world.
Americans have a record of generosity and concern for others unmatched by any other country in the world. I am confident that our proud record will continue in the fall 1984 Combined Federal Campaign. While the decision to give is personal and voluntary, I encourage each of you to join me in wholeheartedly supporting this year's CFC.
RONALD REAGAN
