Statement on Michael K. Deaver 
This is a sad day. Mike Deaver has been our friend for more than 20 years and has served us and his country with uncommon dedication.
Note: Mr. Deaver, who had been Deputy Chief of Staff to the President, was found guilty of three counts of perjury by a Federal grand jury.
