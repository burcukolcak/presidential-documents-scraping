Statement on the Release of Former Hostage Robert Polhill
We are pleased at the news that Robert Polhill has been freed by his captors. We are obviously happy for him, his family and friends. We also wish to thank those who had a hand in the release, particularly the Governments of Syria and Iran, whose efforts have contributed to the release of this hostage.
Our satisfaction at the release, however, is substantially tempered by the knowledge that seven other innocent Americans, as well as a number of foreign nationals, are still being cruelly held hostage in Lebanon. We cannot rest until all hostages are free. Once again, we urgently call on all parties who hold hostages or who have any influence to work to obtain the immediate and unconditional release of the remaining hostages as a humanitarian gesture.
Note: Robert Polhill, an accounting professor at Beirut University College, was kidnaped by pro-Iranian terrorists in Beirut on January 24, 1987.
