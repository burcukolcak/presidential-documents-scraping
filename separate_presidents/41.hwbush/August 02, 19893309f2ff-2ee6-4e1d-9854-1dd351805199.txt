Letter to Congressional Leaders on Abortion Funding in the District of Columbia Appropriations Bill
Dear XXXXX:
The House soon will consider the District of Columbia Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 1990.
If the bill presented to me permits the use of appropriated funds to pay for abortions other than those where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, I will veto it.
I urge the Congress to vote to protect the lives of America's unborn children.
Sincerely,
George Bush
Note: Identical letters were sent to Representatives Julian C. Dixon and Dean A. Gallo, chairman and ranking minority leader of the District of Columbia Subcommittee on Appropriations. The letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on August 3.
