Memorandum of Disapproval of the Bill Waiving Enrollment Requirements for the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989
I am withholding my approval of H.J. Res. 390, which waives the provisions of the United States Code requiring the printing by Congress of H.R. 1278, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. H.R. 1278 was presented to me in printed form and I have signed it into law.
Accordingly, H.J. Res. 390 is superfluous. Under these circumstances, it seems best for me to prevent H.J. Res. 390 from becoming a law by withholding my signature from it.
George Bush
The White House,
August 16, 1989.
APP Note: H.J. Res. 390, 101st Congress, 1st Session, is considered to have become law because of President Bush's failure to return the legislation to Congress during a recess period. The bill is the subject of a pocket veto claim, but is not counted as such.
