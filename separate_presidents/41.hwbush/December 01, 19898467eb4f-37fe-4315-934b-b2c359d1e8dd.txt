Exchange With Reporters in Valletta, Malta, on an Attempted Coup in the Philippines
Q. Mr. President, can you tell us what military assistance you're providing the Philippines, sir?
The President. I'm not going to go into the detail of it, but we're doing what has been requested of us. And we are hopeful that the matter will be contained. It's hard to get proper reports out of there because there seems to be a good deal of fighting.
Q. How do you justify the use of troops, sir?
The President. I didn't tell you I'd justified the use of troops.
Q. We understand that there's been air cover provided. Is it just air cover that they've -- --
The President. That's what I've authorized.
Q. What is the condition -- --
Q. Have you talked to Mrs. Aquino?
The President. The Vice President talked to her just a few minutes ago -- or a couple of hours ago.
Q. And is she all right?
The President. Sounded fine, he said, and very grateful for the call and very grateful for the assistance. And seemed to be confident, but that was a couple of hours ago.
Note: The exchange began at 10:30 a.m. in the Prime Minister's office at l'Auberge de Castille, prior to a meeting with Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami of Malta.
