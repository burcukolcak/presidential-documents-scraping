Letter to Congressional Leaders on Beneficiary Trade Status for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. market and is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974.
In extending nondiscriminatory, most-favored-nation treatment to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the Congress provided that I should take prompt action to grant GSP benefits to the Baltic States, provided they each satisfied the eligibility requirements. I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, and particularly the Baltic nations' ongoing political and economic reforms, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974.
Sincerely,
George Bush
Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Dan Quayle, President of the Senate. The related proclamation is listed in Appendix E at the end of this volume.
