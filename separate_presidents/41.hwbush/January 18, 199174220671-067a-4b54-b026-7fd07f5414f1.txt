Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Activation of the Ready Reserve
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I have today, pursuant to section 673 of title 10, United States Code, authorized the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service within the Department of the Navy, to order to active duty units and individual members not assigned to units of the Ready Reserve. The continued deployment of United States forces in and around the Arabian Peninsula necessitates this action.
A copy of the Executive order implementing this action is attached.
Sincerely,
George Bush
Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Dan Quayle, President of the Senate. The Executive order is listed in Appendix E at the end of this volume.
