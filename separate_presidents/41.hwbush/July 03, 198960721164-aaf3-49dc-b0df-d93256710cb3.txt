Statement on the Supreme Court's Decision on Abortion
We welcome this decision. By upholding the Missouri statute, the Court appears to have begun to restore to the people the ability to protect the unborn. We continue to believe that Roe v. Wade was incorrectly decided and should be reversed.
Americans obviously differ over the difficult issue underlying this case -- the morality and appropriate legal status of abortion. Any decision in this area will stir strong feelings. Nevertheless, I have confidence that the American people will continue to express their deeply held convictions on this subject within the bounds of civility and our legal institutions.
Note: In "Webster v. Reproductive Health Services" the Supreme Court ruled that States had the power to restrict abortion on demand.
