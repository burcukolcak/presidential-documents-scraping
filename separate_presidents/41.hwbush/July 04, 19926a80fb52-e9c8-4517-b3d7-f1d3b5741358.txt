Remarks to the Pepsi 400 Drivers and Owners in Daytona Beach, Florida
Thank you all very much. Thank you guys for the welcome, appreciate it. Thank you very, very much. First off, let me just pay my respects to the France family. Bill's late dad was a friend, and we mourn his passing, a great guy, great for racing, a great American, the values always intact. So I wanted to mention that at the beginning of these very brief remarks.
I salute the spirit of NASCAR, the spirit of racing. If there's ever a group of people that stood for what we call family values, American traditional values, it's this crowd I'm talking to right now. When I think of the Fourth of July, I count my blessings for our freedom. I know we've got some big problems in this country, but there's an awful lot right about the United States of America, too. And this spirit that you feel just the minute you get here expresses a lot about that.
So I really wanted to pop in here, just wish you well, tell you I'm glad to be back. This is my third visit to a race in Daytona. Having been the grand marshal of the Daytona 500, why, I expect it's only downhill. But here I am as President of the United States; maybe that will help a little bit.
But keep up the great work for American sports, American values. We're very, very proud of you. And as for Richard Petty Day or Richard Petty, number 43 -- they're saluting him all the way around the track here -- I'm proud to be at his side on this very special day, too.
Thank you all, and best of luck to all of you.
Note: The President spoke at 9:52 a.m. in Garage 42C at Daytona International Speedway. In his remarks, he referred to William C. France, president of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR); the late William H.G. France, founder of NASCAR; and all-time champion driver Richard Petty, who was participating in his final race at Daytona International Speedway.
