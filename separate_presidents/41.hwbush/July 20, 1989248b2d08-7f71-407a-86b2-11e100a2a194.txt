Letter to Congressional Leaders on Communications Support for Drug Interdiction
Dear XXXXX:
The enclosed report responds to the reporting requirement of Section 1103(b) of the FY 1989 National Defense Authorization Act.
The report focuses on the communications support for drug interdiction and the responsibilities for operating the communications network; provides a description of the funding approach to effect a secure interoperable interagency communications infrastructure to support drug interdiction efforts; highlights the fact that the communications network for drug interdiction is comprised of several communications subsystems and that the components of these subsystems serve a multipurpose function and are not necessarily dedicated for drug interdiction support.
A similar letter is being sent to the Chairman, House Committee on Armed Services, and the Chairmen of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.
Sincerely,
George Bush
Note: Identical letters were sent to Sam Nunn and Les Aspin, chairmen of the Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Armed Services, respectively; and Robert Byrd and Jamie L. Whitten, chairmen of the Senate and House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations, respectively.
