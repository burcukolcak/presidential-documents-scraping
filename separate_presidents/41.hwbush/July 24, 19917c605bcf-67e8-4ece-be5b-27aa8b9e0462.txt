Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe
President Bush. Welcome, everybody.
Q. Mr. President, are you disappointed -- --
President Bush. I'd like to take this opportunity just to welcome President Mugabe here to the Oval Office. I met him many years ago on a visit to his country and have seen him several times since then. But I'm just so pleased you're with us -- --
President Mugabe. Thanks a lot.
President Bush. -- -- and very glad to have you here. A lot to talk about -- about Africa.
President Mugabe. Yes, of course.
President Bush. Any anything else, too, I might add.
South Africa
Q. President Mugabe, do you support President Bush's decision to lift sanctions against South Africa?
President Mugabe. I support his concern about South Africa, his repeated concern that there must be human rights, and the fact that he imposed sanctions against South Africa and still maintains quite a lot of sanctions against South Africa in spite of the relaxation that has taken place.
President Bush. That's what I call a very tactful answer and a very good answer, too, I might add. [Laughter]
Note: The exchange began at 11:03 a.m. in the Oval Office of the White House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
