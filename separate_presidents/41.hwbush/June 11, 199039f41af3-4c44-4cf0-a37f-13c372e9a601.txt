Exchange With Reporters on the Supreme Court Decision Overturning a Federal Flag Desecration Statute
Q. Mr. President, are you going to renew your flag amendment now?
The President. Absolutely.
Q. What's your next step?
The President. I don't know. We just heard the decision. But I'm not in any way pulled back from my conviction that that's what we need. And I think some of us said ahead of time that this legislative approach would not be upheld, and apparently the Court has decided that. So, I will continue to press for what I strongly believe is in the best interest of this country.
Q. Do you believe that's the public appetite for an amendment?
The President. I hope so.
Note: The exchange took place at 11:23 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. On June 11, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a law making it a crime to burn or deface the American flag violated the free-speech guarantee of the first amendment.
