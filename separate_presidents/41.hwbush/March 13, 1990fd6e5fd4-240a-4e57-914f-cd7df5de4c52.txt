Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the Annual Report of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Effective and verifiable arms control treaties are important to the security of the United States and, as President Gorbachev made clear at our Malta meeting, to the Soviet Union as well. Over the past year we have undertaken new initiatives and made steady and substantial progress in our Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, Conventional Forces in Europe, Nuclear Testing, and Chemical Weapons negotiations. These steps can make a lasting contribution to a safer and more secure world for all mankind.
Because of the role of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) in support of these negotiations as well as in other crucial arms control activities, I encourage all members of the Congress to read the attached 1989 annual report. The report reviews the year's arms control initiatives and negotiating efforts, as well as the activities conducted pursuant to the statutory requirements of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, as amended.
Sincerely,
George Bush
Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Dan Quayle, President of the Senate.
