Remarks on Arrival in Battle Creek, Michigan
Thank you for the warm welcome on a cold, cold day. And I am delighted to be here, very pleased to be back in this State at the side of our great friend and Governor, John Engler, longtime supporter. And thank you very, very much for this welcome on this cold day.
My request is to go to those polls on Tuesday and give me 4 more years to lead this country out of this problem and keep our number one leadership in the world. We are the best. And now we've got to bring this economy in Michigan around and continue to lead the whole world.
Thank you all very, very much.
