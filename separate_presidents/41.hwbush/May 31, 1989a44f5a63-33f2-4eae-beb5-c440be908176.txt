Statement on the Resignation of Speaker of the House of Representatives Jim Wright
The Speaker and I are both from Texas. We have been friends for many years. In spite of the present situation, I believe the Wright tenure was one of effectiveness and dedication to the Congress of the United States, and I recognize his distinguished service to the people of his congressional district. Barbara and I wish Jim and Betty well in whatever lies ahead.
