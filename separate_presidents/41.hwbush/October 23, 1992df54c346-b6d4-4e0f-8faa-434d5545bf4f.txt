Statement on Signing Legislation Establishing Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month
Today I am signing into law H.R. 5572, which designates May of each year as "Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month." In May 1990, I was proud to extend Asian Pacific American Heritage Week to a full month celebration. Therefore, I am pleased to have the Congress join me in recognizing the important contributions of Asian Pacific Americans and the impact of their distinct and dynamic cultures on our great Nation.
As President I have witnessed poignant and difficult times for Asian Pacific Americans, but I know the tremendous value of Asian Pacific Americans to this country. Much as others who have come to our shores, Asian Pacific Americans came here seeking freedom and yearning for the American Dream. And like other immigrants, Asian Pacific Americans are finding it -- in the arts, in business, in science, in public service -- across the spectrum of achievement. I am pleased to pay tribute to the significant contributions of Asian Pacific Americans.
