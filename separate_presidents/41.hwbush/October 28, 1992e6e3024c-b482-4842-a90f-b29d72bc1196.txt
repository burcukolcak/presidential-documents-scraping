Statement on Signing the Agricultural Credit Improvement Act of 1992
Today I am signing into law H.R. 6129, the "Agricultural Credit Improvement Act of 1992," which modifies the Farmers Home Administration program.
Although I have signed H.R. 6129, I will withhold my approval of H.R. 6138 because it is identical to section 24 of H.R. 6129.
George Bush
The White House,

Note: H.R. 6129, approved October 28, was assigned Public Law No. 102 - 554. This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on October 29.
