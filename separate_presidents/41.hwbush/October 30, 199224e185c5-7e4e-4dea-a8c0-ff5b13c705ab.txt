Remarks on Arrival in St. Louis, Missouri
Thank you, Don. I just will only say that I am very, very grateful to Governor Schaefer. This is of tremendous support. And yes, we're friends. But I've respected his work for a long, long time. We believe in many of the same objectives. I'm delighted that Maryland is leading the way to America 2000, our education reforms. I've been at his side as we've talked health care, trying to provide better health care for all. I've valued his trust and support during troublesome times of Desert Storm and other matters related to foreign affairs. You heard him talk about international trade.
So it is an honor for me to be endorsed by this outstanding Democratic Governor. And it's just one more reason that I feel that I will, on November 3d, be elected for 4 more years. So, Don, thank you, sir, very much for being with us.
Note: The President spoke at 12:30 p.m. at Lambert/St. Louis Airport. In his remarks, he referred to Gov. William Donald Schaefer of Maryland.
