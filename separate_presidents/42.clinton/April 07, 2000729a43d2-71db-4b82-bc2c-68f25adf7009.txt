For more than 60 years now, Social Security has provided a measure of financial security for seniors after a lifetime of work. Beginning today, Americans of all ages can log on to the Internet and find out in seconds the amount of Social Security benefits they can expect in retirement. The new on-line retirement planner estimates future benefits based on past, present, and projected future income. Just log on to the Social Security website atwww.ssa.gov, and click on the new Social Security retirement planner. It's never too early to plan your financial future.
