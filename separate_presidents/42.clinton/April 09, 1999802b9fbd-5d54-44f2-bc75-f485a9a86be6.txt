Radio Remarks on the Philadelphia Shipyard
Last week the U.S. Navy and Philadelphia signed several important agreements that are good for the city, the Navy, and our Nation. I want to thank Mayor Rendell, the people of the United States Navy, and others who were critical to this important achievement. These agreements, combined with the decision by the Norwegian company Kvaerner to invest here, will help transform Philadelphia's huge and historic naval shipyard, generating thousands of high paying jobs, helping to revitalize America's commercial shipbuilding industry. Working together, this remarkable partnership of business, labor, and Government will modernize the shipyard and train workers to produce state-of-theart commercial ships. Congratulations to the people of Philadelphia on an important new economic venture.
NOTE: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 12:30 p.m. in the administrative offices of Memorial Hall in Philadelphia, PA, for later broadcast. In his remarks, he referred to Mayor Edward G. Rendell of Philadelphia. These remarks were also made available on the White House Press Office Radio Actuality Line.
