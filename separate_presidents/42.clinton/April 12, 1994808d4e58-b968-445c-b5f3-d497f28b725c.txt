Statement on the Nonprofit Liaison Network
I have long advocated the role of the nonprofit sector. Throughout our history, the nonprofit community has helped our Nation adapt to a changing world by strengthening the core values that shape American life. Today, that role has never been more important. The nonprofit liaison network will create better collaboration between the administration and advocacy and service groups in a mutual effort to solve the problems of crime, housing, health care, and other pressing national needs.
