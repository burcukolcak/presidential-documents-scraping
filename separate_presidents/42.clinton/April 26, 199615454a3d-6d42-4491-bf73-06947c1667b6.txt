Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior
Subject: Suspension of Subsection 119(a) of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996, ("Act") as set forth in Section 101(c) of Title I of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (H.R. 3019) Regarding the Mojave National Preserve.
By the authority vested in me by subsection 119(b) of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996, ("Act") as set forth in section 101(c) of title I of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (H.R. 3019), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby suspend subsection 119(a) of the Act because I have determined that such suspension is appropriate based upon the public interest in sound environmental management, sustainable resource use, protection of national or locally-affected interests, and protection of cultural, biological, or historic resources.
This suspension shall take effect immediately and shall continue until subsection 119(a) expires.
