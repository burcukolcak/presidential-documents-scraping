Statement on the Resignation of Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Media Affairs Jeff Eller
From the earliest days of my campaign for President through our first year and a half in the White House, Jeff has served with dedication and uncompromising loyalty. He played a vital role in redefining the technological means used to communicate my policies and programs, and I will miss his service and counsel.
NOTE: This statement was included in a statement by the Press Secretary announcing that Mr. Eller would be leaving the administration in September.
