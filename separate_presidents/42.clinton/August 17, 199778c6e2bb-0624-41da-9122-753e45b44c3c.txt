Remarks on the United Parcel Service Strike
I have just had a conversation with Secretary Herman and with Bruce Lindsey. It's clear that they're making progress in the talks between UPS and the Teamsters, and I just want to urge them to redouble their efforts. This strike is beginning to hurt not only the company but its employees and the people who depend on it. And I think they ought to redouble their efforts to settle this strike, and they ought to do it today. And that's my encouragement to them. I'm pleased by the progress that's been made, and I hope they'll just stay there and settle it today.
Thank you.
