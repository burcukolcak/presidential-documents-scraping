Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
In accordance with section 13(b) of the International Security Assistance Act of 1978, Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question covering the period June 1-July 31, 2000. The previous submission covered events during April and May 2000.
The United Nations resumed its efforts to bring about comprehensive negotiations between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities in Geneva on July 5. These proximity talks, which began in December 1999 in New York, are continuing. However, as my colleagues at the G-8 Summit in Okinawa and I agreed, the two parties need to intensify negotiations in order to bring about a just and lasting settlement. The United States remains committed to the United Nations process and efforts to bring about a solution based upon a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on August 31.
