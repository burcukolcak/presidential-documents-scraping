Statement on Implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement
I am delighted that, as a result of discussions following up on our meeting in Seattle, Canadian Prime Minister Chretien has announced his intention to proclaim the NAFTA by January 1, 1994. We look forward to the smooth and effective implementation of this historic agreement on January 1, so that all three countries can begin to reap the benefits of expanded trade, economic growth, and job creation in North America with the largest free trade area in the world.
NOTE: The proclamation of December 15 and the Executive order of December 27 on implementation of NAFTA are listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
