Statement on the Attorney General's Decision Not To Call for an Independent Counsel
The Attorney General made her decision based on a careful review of the law and the facts, and that's as it should be.
NOTE: On December 2, following preliminary investigations begun in September and October by a Justice Department task force, Attorney General Janet Reno announced her decision that allegations against the President and the Vice President concerning fundraising telephone calls made from the White House did not at that time warrant the appointment of an independent counsel.
