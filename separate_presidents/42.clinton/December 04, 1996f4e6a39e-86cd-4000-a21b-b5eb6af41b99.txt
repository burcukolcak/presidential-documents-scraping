Statement on the Resignation of Senior Adviser for Policy and Strategy George Stephanopoulos
From the snows of New Hampshire in 1991 until the present day, no one has rendered me better advice, nor given more loyal service to this Nation, than George Stephanopoulos. There's no one in Washington who has a better understanding of the intersection of politics, policy, and the way those affect the American people. His work here at the White House is evidence of his deep respect for our country, its system of government, and its people. He cannot be replaced.
George will undoubtedly be a great teacher at Columbia. His boundless intellectual curiosity will be put to good use, shaping the leadership of the future.
