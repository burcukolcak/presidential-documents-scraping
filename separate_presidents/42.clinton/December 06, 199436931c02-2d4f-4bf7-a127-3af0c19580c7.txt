Statement on Webster L. Hubbell
Webb Hubbell is an old friend, and Hillary and I were saddened by today's events. We should also remember that Webb is a man who has given much to his family, his community, and his country. The matter is in the hands of the court, and I don't think it would be appropriate to say anything more at this time.
NOTE: Former Associate Attorney General Webster L. Hubbell pleaded guilty to mail fraud and tax evasion charges on December 6.
