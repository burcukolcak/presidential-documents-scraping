Letter to Congressional Leaders on Trade With Kyrgyzstan
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Kyrgyzstan to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. market and is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974.
I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, and particularly Kyrgyzstan's level of development and initiation of economic reforms, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Kyrgyzstan.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
