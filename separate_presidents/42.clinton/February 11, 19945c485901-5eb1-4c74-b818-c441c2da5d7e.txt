Statement on the Executive Order on Environmental Justice
All Americans have a right to be protected from pollutionâ€”not just those who can afford to live in the cleanest, safest communities. Today we direct Federal agencies to make environmental justice a part of all that they do.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing the signing of the Executive order, which is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
