Radio Address to the People of Burundi
The recent violence in Burundi demonstrates that extremists want to reverse your remarkable progress toward democracy. The United States rejects those who reject peace. We stand with those who are against violence and for tolerance and peace. Burundi has suffered enough.
Your historic elections in 1993 promised to open a new, peaceful chapter in your nation's history. The American people and supporters of democracy around the world watched with high hopes as Burundi embarked on a new course. Despite tragedy and suffering, the vast majority of your people have worked for lasting peace, security, and freedom.
I say to the people and the leaders of Burundi: Do not go back. You deserve to live in peace and without fear. Democracy will help you build a better future for yourselves and your children. Say no to violence and extremism. Say yes to peace and reconciliation.
