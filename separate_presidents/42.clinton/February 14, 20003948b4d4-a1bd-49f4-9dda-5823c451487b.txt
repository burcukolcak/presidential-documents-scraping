Radio Remarks on Funding To Make Communities More Livable
Across America, communities are struggling to protect precious lands so their children will have places to play, hike, and enjoy the great outdoors. Today I'm announcing nearly $60 million in new grants to help communities in all 50 States create parks, preserve forests, and save open space.
And the lands legacy initiative in my new budget will provide permanent funding so that communities can conserve additional lands year after year.
NOTE: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 5 p.m. on February 11 in the Oval Office at the White House for later broadcast, and the transcript was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on February 14. These remarks were also made available on the White House Press Office Actuality Line.
