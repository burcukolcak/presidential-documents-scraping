Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Democratic Congressional Leaders
Economic Program
Q. Mr. President, do you think you can get Ross Perot to at least not criticize this economic plan?
The President. I don't know—
Q. Have you been in touch with him or anybody on your staff been in touch with him to try to get him on board?
Q. Do they treat you like this all the time?
The President. Tomorrow night, all the time.[Laughter]All the time.
Q. What a job.[Laughter]

The President. No. Look, the bond market's a better indicator, because they—and that response has been very positive. And I think when the business community, those people who come in here from the business community who actually know pretty well what's in this program, have responded very positively to it. So I wouldn't say that.
