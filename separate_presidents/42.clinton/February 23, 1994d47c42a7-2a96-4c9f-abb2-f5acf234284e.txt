Statement on the Technology Reinvestment Project
This marks another major step in our effort to protect our national security and promote our economic security in the post-cold-war world. We are investing in projects that will create the jobs of the future by exploring ideas, developing technologies, creating products, and strengthening skills that will keep America strong, militarily and economically.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing the fourth group of awards in the technology reinvestment project.
