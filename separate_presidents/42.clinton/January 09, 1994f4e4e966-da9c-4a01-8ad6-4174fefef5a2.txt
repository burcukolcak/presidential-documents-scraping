Remarks to Citizens in Brussels
Thank you all for coming out tonight. Thank you for waving the flags. I'm sorry we didn't have more room inside, but I'm glad we could show the speech on the screen.
Let me say that I have been in this place many times. I've been here as a student. I've been here as the Governor of my State. I never imagined I would actually be here as President and you would be here to say hello. You have already heard my speech; I have really nothing else to say except I'm delighted to be here. We are here to build a new and stronger future for Europe and a better partnership between Europe and the United States, and I hope all of you will support that.
Happy New Year, and thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 6:47 p.m. in the Grand Place, upon his departure from the Hotel de Ville.
