Message to the Congress on Adjustment of the National Deficit
To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to section 254(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended ("Act") (2 U.S.C. 904(c)), notification is hereby provided of my decision that the adjustment of the maximum deficit amount, as allowed under section 253(g)(1)(B) of the Act (2 U.S.C. 903(g)(1)(B)), shall be made.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON

The White House,

January 21, 1993.
NOTE: The White House released the following statement by the Director of Communications George Stephanopoulos on adjustment of the national deficit:
As provided by the law, the President has today notified the congressional leadership of technical adjustments to be made in calculating the national deficit. This procedure, which occurred automatically under the previous administration for 3 fiscal years, prevents across-the-board budget reductions in accounts such as national defense that could equal 11 percent in the beginning of the next fiscal year. A failure to make this adjustment would also undermine the credibility of economic and budget estimates.
President Clinton will soon put before the Congress a real economic program aimed at reducing the deficit and providing long-term economic growth.
