Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Generalized System of Preferences
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I hereby transmit a Proclamation in which I have determined that it is appropriate to suspend preferential treatment for Belarus as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) because Belarus has not taken and is not taking steps to afford workers in Belarus internationally recognized worker rights. The Proclamation also determines that Malta, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Slovenia meet the definition of a "high income" country as defined by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and that therefore they will be graduated from the GSP, effective January 1, 2002.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The proclamation of July 6 amending the Generalized System of Preferences is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
