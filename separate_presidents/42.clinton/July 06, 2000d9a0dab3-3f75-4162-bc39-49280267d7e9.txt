Statement on the Release of School Accountability Funds
I am pleased that the Education Department announced today the release of the first $100 million from the Title I School Accountability Fund to help States and school districts turn around low-performing schools. Over the last 7 years we have followed a commonsense reform strategy: invest more in our schools and demand more in return. The funds announced today will support local communities in 31 States and the District of Columbia implement strategies that work to turn around their worst performing schools by implementing a tougher curriculum, helping teachers get the skills and training they need, and, if necessary, closing down a failing school and reopening it under new leadership or as a public charter school.
Today I call on Congress again to enact my budget proposal, which would double the accountability fund to $250 million; fulfill our commitment to hire 100,000 high-quality teachers to reduce class size in the early grades; build and modernize public schools; and ensure afterschool help for every child in a failing school. I also urge Congress to pass my education accountability act, which will enhance the efforts of States, districts, and schools to ensure all of America's children can achieve high standards by focusing on results.
NOTE: The statement referred to the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Title I) (Public Law 103-382), which amended the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (Public Law 89-10).
