Exchange With Reporters at the Demilitarized Zone in South Korea
Q. So what do you think?
The President. I think anyone who sees this would understand how important it is for us to stay strong on the issue of North Korea staying in the NPT and allowing those atomic energy inspectors back in there. And I think anyone who sees this would be proud of these young men in uniform for being here.
NOTE: The exchange began at 1:45 p.m. at a lookout post near Camp Bonifas.
