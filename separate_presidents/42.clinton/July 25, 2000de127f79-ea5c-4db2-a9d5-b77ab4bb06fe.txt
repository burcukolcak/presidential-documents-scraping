Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the Report on Peacekeeping Operations
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I am pleased to transmit herewith the 1999 Annual Report to the Congress on Peacekeeping required by section 4 of the United Nations Participation Act (Public Law 79-264), as amended.
United Nations and other peacekeeping operations helped us protect our interests before they were directly threatened, and ensured that other nations shared with us the risks and costs of maintaining international stability.
I look forward to working with you to ensure that peacekeeping remains a viable option for dealing with international conflicts.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
