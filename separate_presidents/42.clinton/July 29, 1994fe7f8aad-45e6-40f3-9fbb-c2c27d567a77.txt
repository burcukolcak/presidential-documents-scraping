Statement on the Death of John Britton and James Barrett
I strongly condemn the senseless shootings today which abruptly ended the lives of two men and seriously wounded a third in Pensacola, Florida.
The safety, freedom, and protection of all our citizens is paramount in guaranteeing the health and vitality of our Nation. I am strongly committed to ending this form of domestic terrorism that threatens the fabric of our country. I encourage a quick and thorough investigation into this tragic incident as the local officials work closely with the resources of the Federal law enforcement community.
Hillary and I extend our deepest sympathy to the friends and family of Dr. John Britton and Mr. James Barrett on their tragic loss today, and I speak for all Americans in expressing my hope for a full and complete recovery for Mrs. June Barrett.
NOTE: Dr. Britton and his escorts, Mr. and Mrs. Barrett, were attacked as they arrived at an abortion clinic where the doctor worked.
