Letter to Congressional Leaders on Trade With Bulgaria
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I hereby transmit a report concerning emigration laws and policies of the Republic of Bulgaria as required by subsections 402(b) and 409(b) of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("the Act") (19 U.S.C. 2432(b) and 2439(b)). I have determined that Bulgaria is in full compliance with the criteria in subsections 402(a) and 409(a) of the Act. As required by Title IV, I will provide the Congress with periodic reports regarding Bulgaria's compliance with these emigration standards.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
