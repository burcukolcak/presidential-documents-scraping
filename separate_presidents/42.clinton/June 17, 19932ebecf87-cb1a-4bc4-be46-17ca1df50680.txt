Exchange With Reporters on Somalia
Q. Mr. President, are you satisfied with the level of military activity in Somalia, or do we need to add the Marines that are heading that way?
The President. Well, let me just say that for now I think I should say that I've been fully briefed on what has happened to date. I'm encouraged, and I may have more to say about it this evening.
NOTE: The exchange began at 4:40 p.m. in the Oval Office at The White House, prior to a meeting with White House fellows. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
