Remarks at the Opening Day Ceremonies for World Cup Soccer in Chicago
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow Americans, citizens of the world, the United States is honored to play host to this magnificent celebration. The World Cup has captured the imagination of our country, as has the game itself in the last few years. The love of soccer is now a universal language that binds us all together. So I welcome all who have come from all countries and all continents and all who will watch these games in the United States for the next 30 days.
We will reward with our cheers the courage and skill of all the players. Let us, in the process, come to appreciate the unity of people throughout the world that this game represents. I say especially to President Sanchez and the people of Bolivia,buena suertetoday. To Chancellor Kohl and the people of Deutschland,Viel Gluck. Good luck to you all, and welcome to the United States.
