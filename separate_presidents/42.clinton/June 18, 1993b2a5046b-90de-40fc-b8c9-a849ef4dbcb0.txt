Exchange With Reporters Following Discussions With King Hussein of Jordan
Budget Proposal
Q. Do you like the budget?
The President. I think in the end, I like it a lot. It's not done yet. We're not even through the Senate yet. We've got a lot of work to do.
Q. Mr. President, what's your reaction to the reprimand accepted by General Campbell?
Q. What do you think aboutâ€”for Campbell?
[At this point, one group of reporters left the room, and another group entered.]
Discussions With King Hussein
Q. What did you accomplish today in the meeting, sir?
The President. Talked a lot about the peace process. I learned about the King's position; he learned about the United States position. We talked a little about Iraq and the imperative nature of continuing to enforce those sanctions and being very tough on them. We talked about his efforts to democratize the country and to modernize the economy and deal with all the things he's dealt with over the last 40 years and especially the last 3. It was a very, very good meeting.
NOTE: The exchange began at 1:50 p.m. at the Diplomatic Entrance at the White House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
