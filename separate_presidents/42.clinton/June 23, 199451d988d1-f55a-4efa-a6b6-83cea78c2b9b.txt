Statement on the White House Conference on Travel and Tourism
The travel and tourism industry is one of the unsung heroes of our economy. Your businesses employ more than 6 million Americans and, equally important, international tourism is one sector of our economy that consistently generates a trade surplus. The White House Conference on Travel and Tourism will provide you and your colleagues an opportunity to meet with leaders in the executive branch and in Congress and, I hope, to develop a shared vision, both of the industry's future and of the role of the industry in our Nation's future.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing the November 1995 conference.
