Remarks on the Terrorist Attack in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia
An explosion occurred this afternoon at the United States military housing complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
Our best information at this time is that there are many injured. There have been fatalities. We do not yet know how many. The explosion appears to be the work of terrorists, and if that is the case, like all Americans, I am outraged by it.
The cowards who committed this murderous act must not go unpunished. Within a few hours, an FBI team will be on its way to Saudi Arabia to assist in the investigation. Our condolences and our prayers go out to the victims' families and their friends. We're grateful for the professionalism shown by the Saudi authorities in their reaction to this emergency. We are ready to work with them to make sure those responsible are brought to justice.
Let me say again, we will pursue this. America takes care of our own. Those who did it must not go unpunished.
Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 6:22 p.m. in the Briefing Room at the White House. The related proclamation of June 26 honoring the victims of the bombing in Saudi Arabia is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
