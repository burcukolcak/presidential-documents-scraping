Message to the Senate Transmitting the Latvia-United States Tax Convention With Documentation
To the Senate of the United States:
I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the Convention Between the United States of America and the Republic of Latvia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at Washington on January 15, 1998. Also transmitted is the report of the Department of State concerning the Convention.
This Convention, which is similar to tax treaties between the United States and OECD nations, provides maximum rates of tax to be applied to various types of income and protection from double taxation of income. The Convention also provides for resolution of disputes and sets forth rules making its benefits unavailable to residents that are engaged in treaty shopping.
I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this Convention and that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House,
