Statement on the Supreme Court Decision To Uphold Miranda v. Arizona
In 1966 the Supreme Court decided inMirandav.Arizonathat law enforcement officials must give certain warnings, including a suspect's right to remain silent and to have counsel, before criminal suspects are questioned in custody. I am very pleased that today the Supreme Court by a large majority, has affirmed that ruling and upheld the important constitutional rights protected byMiranda.As Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion notes, the warnings have become part of our national culture; they have worked for law enforcement by providing clear standards for our officers; and they have worked to protect the rights of our citizens. I am pleased that today's opinion so resoundingly reinforces the important place of theMirandawarnings in our Nation's criminal justice system.
