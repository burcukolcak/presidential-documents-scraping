Statement on the Supreme Court Decision on Restriction of Protests Outside Health Care Facilities
I am pleased that the Supreme Court today, inHillv.Colorado,upheld a Colorado statute balancing a person's right to protest certain medical procedures against another person's right to obtain medical treatment free from harassment, fear, and intimidation. The Colorado law was enacted in response to a real need to ensure safe access to medical treatment in light of increasing obstruction, harassment, and violence in front of health care facilities. To preserve a woman's right to choose, we must protect access to reproductive health services. That is why I championed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE), a Federal statute that protects women and doctors from violence at reproductive health clinics.
NOTE: The statement referred to Public Law No. 103-259, approved May 26, 1994.
