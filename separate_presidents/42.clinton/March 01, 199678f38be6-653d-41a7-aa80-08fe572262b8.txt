Statement on Food and Drug Administration Approval of an HIV/AIDS Drug
Our national investment in AIDS research is paying off. Among scientists, as among many people living with HIV, despair is giving way to hope. We cannot stop now. We must recommit ourselves to finding a cure.
NOTE: The statement referred to the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the second protease inhibitor to treat HIV/AIDS.
