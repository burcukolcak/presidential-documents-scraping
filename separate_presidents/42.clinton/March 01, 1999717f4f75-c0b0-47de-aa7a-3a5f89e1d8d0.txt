Radio Remarks on "Read Across America" Day
The best and most enjoyable way for children to open their minds is by opening a book. This Tuesday America will celebrate "Read Across America" Day. More than one million people—from baseball star Cal Ripken, Jr., to the sailors of the U.S.S.Saipan—will share the joy of reading with children in every part of our country. I encourage all caring adults to get involved. Read to children on "Read Across America" Day, and read to them every day. Together, we can make our children the best readers in the world.
NOTE: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 2:55 p.m. in the Oval Office on February 22 for later broadcast as a public service announcement. These remarks were also made available on the White House Press Office Radio Actuality Line.
