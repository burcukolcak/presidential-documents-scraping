Statement on Presentation of the Presidential Citizens Medal to Representative William H. Natcher
Congressman Natcher has served the people of Kentucky and this Nation with distinction since 1941. He is revered by friends and opponents alike, and I can think of no person who deserves our recognition more. He represents the model of leadership to which we should all strive.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing that the President presented Representative Natcher with the medal at Bethesda Naval Hospital, Bethesda, MD.
