Statement on the Executive Order on Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation at Federal Facilities
For too long, we have paid too much to heat, cool, and light Federal buildings. That's why I'm directing all agencies across the Nation to make profitable investments in energy efficiency, investments that will benefit the environment and the taxpayer. This initiative makes Government work better and cost less.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing the signing of the Executive order, which is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
