Statement on Announcing the Forest Conference
Planning and good long-term management can help us protect jobs and the unique oldgrowth forests that are as much a part of our national heritage as the Grand Canyon or Yosemite. It is time to break the gridlock that has blocked action and bring all sides together to craft a balanced approach to the economic and environmental challenges we face.
NOTE: The President's statement was included in a White House statement announcing the Forest Conference scheduled for April 2 in Portland, OR.
