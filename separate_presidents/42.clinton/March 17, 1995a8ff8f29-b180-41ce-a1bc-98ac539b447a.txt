Message to the Congress on Trade With the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
To the Congress of the United States:
I am writing to inform you of my intent to designate the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a beneficiary of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program, which offers duty-free access to the U.S. market, was originally authorized by the Trade Act of 1974.
I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, March 17, 1995.
