Memorandum on the 1995 United States Savings Bonds Campaign
Memorandum for All Federal Government Employees
Subject:1995 U.S. Savings Bonds Campaign
The Federal Government will soon be conducting the 1995 Savings Bonds Campaign. This campaign is your chance to sign up for the Payroll Savings Plan for U.S. Savings Bonds or to increase your rate of saving if you are already participating.
Getting into the habit of saving money is not easy, no matter how hard you try. The Payroll Savings Plan for U.S. Savings Bonds is a convenient method of saving regularly that offers tax advantages and investment market-based interest rates for small sums of money. When you join the plan, you select an amount to be set aside from each paycheck to buy bonds. The rest is automatic; you save payday after payday without interruption.
In addition to their direct personal benefits, Savings Bonds also help reduce Federal spending. As members of the Government, we must set an example for all citizens to follow by establishing a high rate of participation in this excellent program.
Savings Bonds have helped millions of Americans purchase homes, finance college educations, guarantee secure retirements, and weather financial emergencies. When one of your fellow employees calls on you during the campaign, please consider how bonds can help you to achieve your own financial goalsâ€”then sign up for bonds.
