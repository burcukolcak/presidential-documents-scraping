Statement on Senate Action on the Line-Item Veto
The Senate tonight has taken another step toward passing strong line-item veto legislation. I hope the House and Senate will now get together quickly to resolve their differences and pass the strongest possible bill. The sooner such a bill reaches my desk, the sooner I can take further steps to cut the deficit.
