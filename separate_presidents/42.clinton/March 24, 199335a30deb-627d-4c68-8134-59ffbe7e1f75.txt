Exchange With Reporters on Russia
Q. Mr. President, did you and Mr. Kozyrev reach any kind of agreement on the type of aid package that might be most helpful for Russia?
The President. No, we discussed what I was thinking about and what our people are working on. And I told him it would be a good and specific package, and I was looking forward to having the opportunity to discuss it with President Yeltsin.
Q. Did he give you any encouragement, sir, that the current political crisis could be resolved?
The President. I think he's hopeful.
Q. Any specifics as to how it might be resolved, sir?
The President. No, he's been here with me.
