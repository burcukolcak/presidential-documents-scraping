Exchange With Reporters on Bosnia
Q. Mr. President, the Serbs are now saying that they're going to cut off all but humanitarian supplies to the Bosnians. Do you have any reaction to that?
The President. Well, that would be a good start. We'll see. We're working today on a lot of options. I want to see what happens over the next few days.
Q. Have you gotten back to the Europeans, sir?
The President. Oh, of course.
Q. Today I mean, with either Mitterrand or Major?
The President. I talked with President Mitterrand today.
Q. Mr. President, is military action inevitable at this point? Do you have to do something like that?
The President. I don't want to say anything else. You know what we're doing, and the Christopher mission is proceeding. And I don't have anything to add to what I said earlier except any welcome signs would be welcome. Let's see if anybody changes their conduct.
Q. It doesn't sound like you're getting a lot of welcoming from the Europeans on the Christopher mission.
The President. Oh, I have talked to Mitterrand today. We'll see what happens.
