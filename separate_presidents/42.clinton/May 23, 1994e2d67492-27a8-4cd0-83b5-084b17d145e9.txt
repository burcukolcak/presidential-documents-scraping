Remarks Prior to Discussions With President Abdou Diouf of Senegal and an Exchange With Reporters
The President.Let me say, it's a great honor for me to have the President of Senegal here and to thank him publicly for the leadership that his country has shown in promoting democracy and economic market reforms and many activities of the United Nations designed to save lives. I am very grateful for that, and I look forward to this meeting. We've never had an opportunity to talk before, but our two nations have had very close and good relationships, and I think we'll continue them.
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
