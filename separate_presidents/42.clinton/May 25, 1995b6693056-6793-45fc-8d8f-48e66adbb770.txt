Statement on the United Nations/NATO Decision To Launch Airstrikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina
I welcome the decision of the U.N. and NATO to launch airstrikes today against a Bosnian-Serb ammunition site following the violence of the past several days in and around Sarajevo. This action was taken in response to Bosnian-Serb defiance of yesterday's UNPROFOR demand for the return of heavy weapons to designated weapons collection points in accord with existing agreements.
This action should help NATO and the U.N. sustain their ability to ease suffering in the region. I hope that today's airstrikes will convince the Bosnian-Serb leadership to end their violations of the exclusion zone and comply with their other agreements with the U.N.
I appreciate the courage and dedication of the U.N. forces on the ground in the former Yugoslavia and trust that this evidence of U.N. and NATO determination will serve to enhance the ability of these forces to remain and perform their missions.
