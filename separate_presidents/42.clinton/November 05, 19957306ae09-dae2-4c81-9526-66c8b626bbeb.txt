Statement of Condolence on the Death of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel
Prime Minister Rabin gave his life to Israel, first as a soldier for its freedom, then finally as a martyr for its lasting peace.
For his example, his friendship to the United States, and his warm friendship to me, I am eternally grateful.
