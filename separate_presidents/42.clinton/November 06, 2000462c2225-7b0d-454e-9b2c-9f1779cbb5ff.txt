Statement on Signing the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act
Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 5178, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act. This legislation requires changes in the bloodborne pathogens standard in effect under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Supported by healthcare workers and their unions, as well as a bipartisan group of Members of Congress, this bill will help to ensure the safety of health care workers who may be exposed to disease while handling certain medical devices. The Needlestick Safety Act makes clearer the responsibility of employers to lessen the risk of injuries to workers from contaminated sharp devices. It also encourages manufacturers of medical sharps to increase the number of safer devices in the market. This legislation will help to make health care occupations safer.
NOTE: H.R. 5178, approved November 6, was assigned Public Law No. 106-430.
