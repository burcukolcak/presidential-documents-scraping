Statement on the Outcome of the Puerto Rican Referendum
I fully support the determination of the citizens of Puerto Rico to continue their commonwealth status.
I am especially gratified by the high level of participation in Sunday's referendum, and I look forward to maintaining the relationship of friendship and mutual respect that the United States enjoys with the people of Puerto Rico.
