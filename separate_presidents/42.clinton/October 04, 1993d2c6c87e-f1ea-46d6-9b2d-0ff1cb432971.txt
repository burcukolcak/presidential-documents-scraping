Statement on Rebuilding the Cypress Freeway in California
Most Americans will never forget the picture of the Cypress Freeway collapsed upon itself after the Loma Prieta earthquake. As repairs continue, I want the people of California to know that we will be there to get the job done. Communities around our Nation have always been able to count on the Federal Government to assume the cost of repairing Federal-aid highways hit by natural disasters. That is a commitment that we are helping to fulfill today.
NOTE: The President's statement was included in a White House statement announcing the President's request to Congress for funds to rebuild the freeway.
