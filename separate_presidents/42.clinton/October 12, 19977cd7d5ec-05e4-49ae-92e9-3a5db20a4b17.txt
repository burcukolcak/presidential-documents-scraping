Statement on the 20th Anniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act
On the 20th anniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), we should all be proud of what that law has meant for low- and moderate-income Americans of all races. Although we still have a long way to go in bringing all Americans into the economic mainstream, under CRA the private sector has pumped billions of dollars of credit to build housing, create jobs, and restore hope in communities left behind.
