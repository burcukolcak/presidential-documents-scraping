Statement on Disaster Assistance for Georgia
I am pleased that we can provide additional assistance to the people of Georgia in their efforts to rebuild their communities. I look forward to working in cooperation with them in the recovery.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing the President's decision to authorize an increase in the Federal Government's part of the cost-share program for repairing flood-damaged public property.
