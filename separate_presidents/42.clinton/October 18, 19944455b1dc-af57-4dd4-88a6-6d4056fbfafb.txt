Statement on Flooding in Texas
My thoughts are with the people of Texas during this crisis. With the help of our team down in Texas, I will continue to monitor the situation closely.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing that the President directed Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena, Small Business Administrator Phil Lader, and Federal Emergency Management Agency officials to travel to Texas to survey flood damage.
