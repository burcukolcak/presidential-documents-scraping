Statement on Flooding and Tornadoes in Georgia
My heart is with the people of Georgia. I admire their courageous work in repairing their communities from the floods this summer, and my thoughts are with them as they battle these latest forces of nature.
NOTE: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing disaster assistance for Georgia due to flooding and tornadoes that began October 1.
