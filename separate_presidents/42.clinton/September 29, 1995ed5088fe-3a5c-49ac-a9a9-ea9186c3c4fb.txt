Exchange With Reporters on the 1996 Election
Q.Mr. President, I don't know if you've heard that Governor Pete Wilson is going to drop out of the Presidential race this afternoon.
The President.No. Are you sure? [Laughter] Well, Iâ€”that's a very personal decision. It's a difficult road, and I respect the judgment that he would make, or anybody would make under these circumstances, since I've been through it. I hope we will continue to be able to work together on some of our common problems. I said in Los Angeles when I was there a couple of days ago that the Governor's office worked very closely with us when we were trying to solve the problems of the medical center for Los Angeles County, and there's a lot of important work to do and he still has a very important job.
Q.Does this help your prospects in California?
The President.I don't know.
NOTE: The exchange began at 11:45 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White House prior to discussions with King Hussein of Jordan. In his remarks, the President referred to Governor Pete Wilson of California. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
