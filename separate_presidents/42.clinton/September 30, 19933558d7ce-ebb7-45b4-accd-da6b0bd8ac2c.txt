Statement on Signing the Continuing Appropriations Resolution
Today I have signed into law House Joint Resolution 267, a Continuing Resolution that funds the operations of the Federal Government during October 1-21, 1993.
A Continuing Resolution is necessary at this time in order to keep the Government functioning while the Congress completes the appropriations process.
I commend the Congress for presenting me with a funding measure that provides for a simple, temporary extension of normal Government operations and is free of extraneous amendments. I urge the Congress to complete the regular appropriations process by October 21 so that a second Continuing Resolution can be avoided.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
The White House, September 30, 1993.
NOTE: H.J. Res. 267, approved September 30, was assigned Public Law No. 103-88.
