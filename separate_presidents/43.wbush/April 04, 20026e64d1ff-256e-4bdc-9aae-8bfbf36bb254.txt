Message on the Observance of the Anniversary of the Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Today, as we mark the 34th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I join my fellow Americans in remembering Dr. King and renewing his call for equality and justice for all our citizens.
Dr. King was a man of deep faith who dedicated his life to a crucial and just cause that changed this Nation. He graciously and peacefully called for our country to abide by the principles of unity, equality, and racial justice for every citizen regardless of race, creed, or background. For too brief a time, our Nation benefited from his work, yet his dream lives on in the hearts of a new generation. I join all citizens in recognizing this important American and his legacy of freedom, equality, and justice for all.
GEORGE W. BUSH
