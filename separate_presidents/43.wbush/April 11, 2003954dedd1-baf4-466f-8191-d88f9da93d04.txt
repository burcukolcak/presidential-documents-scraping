Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a Supplemental Budget Request for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
Dear Mr. Speaker:
I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed request for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). This request would provide an additional $18.3 million to the EEOC in FY 2003. It is needed for the EEOC to avoid furloughing its entire workforce for as many as 19 days in FY 2003, which would significantly disrupt its ability to conduct its enforcement responsibilities.
The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and observations.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
