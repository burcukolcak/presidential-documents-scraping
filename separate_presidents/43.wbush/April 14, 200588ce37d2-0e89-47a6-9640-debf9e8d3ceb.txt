Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Bankruptcy Reform Legislation
I commend the House for acting in bi-partisan fashion to curb abuses of the bankruptcy system. These commonsense reforms will make the system stronger and better so that more Americans—especially lower-income Americans—have greater access to credit. I look forward to signing the bill into law.
