Remarks on the Election of Pope Benedict XVI
Laura and I offer our congratulations to Pope Benedict XVI. He's a man of great wisdom and knowledge. He's a man who serves the Lord. We remember well his sermon at the Pope's funeral in Rome, how his words touched our hearts and the hearts of millions. We join with our fellow citizens and millions around the world who pray for continued strength and wisdom as His Holiness leads the Catholic Church.
Thank you all.
NOTE: The President spoke at 3:31 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White House upon arrival from Springfield, IL.
