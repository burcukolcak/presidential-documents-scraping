Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy
Subject:Presidential Determination on the Proposed Protocol Amending the Agreement for Cooperation Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy
