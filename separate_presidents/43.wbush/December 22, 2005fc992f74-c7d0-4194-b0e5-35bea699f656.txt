Statement on Congressional Passage of Legislation Funding the Armed Forces for the War on Terror in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Elsewhere
I applaud the Congress for passing legislation to fund our troops who are fighting the war on terror in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. This funding will help us continue to hunt down the terrorists, pursue our strategy for victory in Iraq, and make America more secure. I look forward to signing the bill into law.
