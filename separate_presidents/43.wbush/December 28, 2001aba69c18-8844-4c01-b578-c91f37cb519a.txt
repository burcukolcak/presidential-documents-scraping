Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Digital Computer Exports
Dear __________:
In accordance with the provisions of section 1211(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (Public Law 105-85), I hereby notify you of my decision to establish a new level for the notification procedure for digital computers set forth in section 1211(a) of Public Law 105-85. The new level will be 190,000 millions of theoretical operations per second (MTOPS). In accordance with the provisions of section 1211(e), I hereby notify you of my decision to remove Latvia from the list of countries covered under section 1211(b). The attached report provides the rationale supporting these decisions and fulfills the requirements of Public Law 105-85, sections 1211(d) and (e).
I have made these changes based on the recommendation of the Departments of State, Defense, Commerce, and Energy.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
