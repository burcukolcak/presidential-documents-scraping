Statement on Representative W.J. " Billy" Tauzin's Decision Not To Seek Reelection
Billy Tauzin has always been a friend to American consumers and seniors as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He is a strong leader and a good friend, and we will miss his experience and sense of humor. Laura and I wish Billy and Cecile the best.
