Remarks at a Lunch Hosted by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia in Monrovia
Madam President, I want to make sure I've got the following correctly: Here they call you the "Iron Lady," and here they call you "Ma." And I call you friend.
We are honored to be here. Laura and I are thrilled to be here with our delegation to end what has been a very productive trip to the continent of Africa. I can't think of a better place to finish than in—with our dear friend, Liberia.
It is easy to destroy a country; it is hard to rebuild a country. And I—Madam President, I want you to know that the United States of America supports you as you rebuild your country. We share a special history with Liberia. It's a history that is deep, and I want the people of your beautiful country to know that our help is just beginning.
And so, Madam President, I propose a toast to you and the strength of your leadership and the quality of your character. And to the good people of Liberia, may God bless.
NOTE: The President spoke at 12:54 p.m. in the Executive Mansion. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included the remarks of President Johnson Sirleaf.
