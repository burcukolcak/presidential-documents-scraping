Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Consistent with the authorities relating to official immunity in the interdiction of aircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking (Public Law 107-108, 22 U.S.C. 2291-4), and in order to keep the Congress fully informed, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration. This report addresses the matter of assistance for interdiction of aircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
