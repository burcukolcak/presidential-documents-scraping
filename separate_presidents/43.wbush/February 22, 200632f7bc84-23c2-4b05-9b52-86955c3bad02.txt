Letter to Congressional Leaders on Extending Generalized System of Preferences Benefits to Liberia
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Liberia to the list of beneficiary developing countries and to the list of least-developed beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. In light of these criteria, I have determined that it is appropriate to end the suspension of Liberia as a GSP beneficiary developing country and to extend least-developed beneficiary developing country benefits to Liberia.
This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(f) of the Trade Act of 1974.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate. The related proclamation of February 22 is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
