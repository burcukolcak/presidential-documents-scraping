Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom at Camp David, Maryland
Q.How is it going so far?
President Bush.Pretty darn good.
Q.How was lunch? Is it true that Churchill once came to this cabin?
President Bush.That's exactly right.
Q.How goes the get-acquainted session?
President Bush.Good, John [John Roberts, CBS News], thank you. "Ambassador" Johndroe was telling us where to go.
Q.Sir, can you tell us the historical significance of where you're standing?
President Bush.This is where Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the first visitor to Camp David, stayed. It's a huge honor for Laura and me to welcome the current Prime Minister and his wife. And we're about to have a press availability to answer all these difficult questions that you're throwing at us, John. I promised the Prime Minister that you in particular would behave well during the press conferenceâ€” and Fournier [Ron Fournier, Associated Press].
All right, we're actually now going to go for a walk of a couple miles.
Q.Mr. Prime Minister, where's your coat?
Prime Minister Blair.It's around somewhere, but actually it's a lot warmer than Canada.
President Bush.You shouldn't have noticed that.
NOTE: The exchange began at 3:23 p.m. on the porch of Holly Lodge. In his remarks, the President referred to Assistant Press Secretary Gordon Johndroe and Prime Minister Blair's wife, Cherie. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
