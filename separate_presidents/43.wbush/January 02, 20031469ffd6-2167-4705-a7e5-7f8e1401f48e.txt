Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Libya
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in theFederal Registerand transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice, stating that the Libya emergency is to continue in effect beyond January 7, 2003, to theFederal Registerfor publication. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was published in theFederal Registeron January 4, 2002 (67FR637).
The crisis between the United States and Libya that led to the declaration on January 7, 1986, of a national emergency has not been resolved. Despite the United Nations Security Council's suspension of U.N. sanctions against Libya upon the Libyan government's hand-over of the Pan Am 103 bombing suspects, Libya has not yet complied with its obligations under U.N. Security Council Resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992), and 883 (1993), which include Libya's obligation to accept responsibility for the actions of its officials and pay compensation.
For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to Libya and maintain in force the comprehensive sanctions against Libya to respond to this threat.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
