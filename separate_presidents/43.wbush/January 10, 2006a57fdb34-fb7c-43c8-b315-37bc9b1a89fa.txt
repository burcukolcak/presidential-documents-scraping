In accordance with this provision, I have sent to theFederal Registerfor publication the enclosed notice, which states that the emergency declared with respect to the Government of Cuba's destruction of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international airspace north of Cuba on February 24, 1996, as amended and expanded on February 26, 2004, is to continue in effect beyond March 1, 2006.
Sincerely,
