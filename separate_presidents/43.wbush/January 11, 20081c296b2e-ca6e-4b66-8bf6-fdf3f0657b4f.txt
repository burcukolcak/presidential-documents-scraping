Remarks During a Visit to Yad Vashem in Jerusalem
Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for your wonderful hospitality. I would hope as many people in the world would come to this place, it would be a sobering reminder that evil exists and a call that when we find evil, we must resist it. It also is aâ€”I guess I came away with this impression, that I was most impressed that people, in the face of horror and evil, would not forsake their God, that in the face of unspeakable crimes against humanity, brave souls, young and old, stood strong for what they believe.
It's an honor to be here. It is a moving experience, and it is a living memory that is important. Thank you, sir.
NOTE: The President spoke at 9:43 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel; and Avner Shalev, chairman, Yad Vashem Directorate.
