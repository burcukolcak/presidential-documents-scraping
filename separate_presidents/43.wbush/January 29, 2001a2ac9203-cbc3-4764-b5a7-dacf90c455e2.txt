Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Bipartisan Congressional Leaders and an Exchange With Reporters
Legislative Agenda
The President.I'm continuing a series of meetings I'm going to have with Members of the Congress. I'm very serious about sitting down as often as possible with people from both parties to have frank discussions about issues that concern the country. I believe there is a very good opportunity for us to exceed expectations. Expectations are that nothing will get done. I'm confident that the people here in Washington and Members of the Senate don't agree with that.
We're going to talk about education, and we're going to talk about taxes. We'll talk about the patients' bill of rights—a variety of issues that are of concern, and what we call front burner issues, issues that should be making it through the Congress soon.
I want to thank the Members for coming. I'm honored that they would come down from the Hill to visit the Vice President and me. Thanks for coming.
Q.I have one question about——
The President.I'll catch you tomorrow. You missed your chance at the third press availability. [Laughter]
Q.When are you going to do your first news conference, Mr. President?
The President.These mini news conferences count. [Laughter]
