Statement on Senate Confirmation of John Snow as Secretary of the Treasury
I am pleased that the Senate acted quickly to confirm John Snow as Secretary of the Treasury. John will work with me to strengthen economic growth and create jobs so that everyone who seeks work can find work. I thank Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus and commend them for their leadership.
