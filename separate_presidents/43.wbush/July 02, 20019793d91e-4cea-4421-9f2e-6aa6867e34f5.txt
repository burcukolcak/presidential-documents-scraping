Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on the Extension of Normal Trade Relations Status With Belarus
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
I hereby transmit the report referred to in subsection 402(c)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, with respect to a waiver of the application of subsections 402(a) and (b) of that Act to the Republic of Belarus.
I have determined that such a waiver will substantially promote the objectives of section 402, and I have instructed the Secretary of State to provide a copy of that determination to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President of the Senate. The report also indicates that I have received the assurances with respect to the emigration practices of the Republic of Belarus required by section 402(c)(2)(B) of the Act.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate. The related Executive order and memorandum of July 2 are listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
