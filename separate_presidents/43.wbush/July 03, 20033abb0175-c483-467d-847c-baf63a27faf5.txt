Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting Proposed Legislative Changes To Implement the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
On May 6, 2003, I signed the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(B) of the Trade Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-210), I am submitting a description of the changes to existing laws, prepared by my Administration, that would be required to bring the United States into compliance with that Agreement.
I look forward to working with the Congress in developing legislation to implement this important Free Trade Agreement.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate.
