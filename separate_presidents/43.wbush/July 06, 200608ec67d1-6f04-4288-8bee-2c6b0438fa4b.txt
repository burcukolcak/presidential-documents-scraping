Remarks Following a Dinner With Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago and Business Leaders in Chicago, Illinois
Laura said, "What do you want for your birthday?" I said, "I want to have dinner in Chicago with the mayor." [Laughter] Thank you all for joining us. We've had a wonderful discussion. Chicago is a fabulous town, Mayor. And you're awfully kind to host us here.
Somebody said, "Well, what's your birthday wish?" I've got a lot of birthday wishes. I hope our troops are safe. I hope Roger Ebert does well. That's a birthday wish. I know a lot of people here in Chicago are praying for him. It's been a heck of a birthday party tonight, and I appreciate you all joining me, and looking forward to having my cake.
Thanks for coming.
NOTE: The President spoke at 8:21 p.m. in the Chicago Firehouse Restaurant. In his remarks, he referred to Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert, who had emergency surgery on July 2. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
