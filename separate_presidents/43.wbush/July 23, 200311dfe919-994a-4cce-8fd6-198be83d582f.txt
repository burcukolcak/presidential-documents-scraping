Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Reallocation of Funds Previously Transferred From the Emergency Response Fund
Dear Mr. Speaker:
In order to continue the necessary and critical responses to the September 11 terrorist attacks, I am notifying the Congress of my intent to reallocate funds previously transferred from the Emergency Response Fund (ERF).
At this time, $5 million of ERF funds will be transferred to the Food and Drug Administration to support activities to improve the security of the food supply.
The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
