Statement on Senate Confirmation of Thomas B. Griffith as a United States Court of Appeals Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit
I commend the Senate for confirming Tom Griffith to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Tom is an accomplished and experienced lawyer who will bring a broad range of legal experience to the court. He has served in the important post of Senate Legal Counsel, as general counsel at a major university, and in private practice. I look forward to the Senate's prompt consideration and up-or-down votes for my other judicial nominees.
