Remarks Following a Meeting With the Iraq Study Group
I want to thank a distinguished group of Americans, led by Jim Baker and Lee Hamilton, for your willingness to look at the way forward in Iraq and to provide advice to the administration, to the Congress, and to the American people about the proper strategies and tactics to achieve success.
Iraq is a complex situation. It is vital that we succeed. And the fact that you all are willing to lend your expertise to help chart the way forward means a lot. And I can't thank you enough. We've got Republicans at the table; we've got Democrats at the table; we've got people who've served in the administration, administrations past, our court system, and the legislative branch. And you bring a lot of expertise and a lot of knowledge, and the fact that you're willing to lend your expertise and knowledge to help our country means a lot.
Once again, you've been called to serve, and once again, you are serving, and we thank you for that a lot. Appreciate you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 2:36 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to James A. Baker III and Lee H. Hamilton, cochairs, Iraq Study Group.
