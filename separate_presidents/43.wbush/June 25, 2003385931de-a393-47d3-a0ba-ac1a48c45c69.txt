Joint Statement by President George W. Bush and European Council President Konstandinos Simitis and European Commission President Romano Prodi on Transatlantic Aviation Negotiations
We are pleased to announce our agreement to begin comprehensive air service negotiations between the United States and the European Union in early autumn, following the early June decision of the Council of the European Union to approve a negotiating mandate for the Commission. This is an historic opportunity to build upon the framework of existing agreements with the goal of opening access to markets and maximizing benefits for consumers, airlines, and communities on both sides of the Atlantic. The United States and the European Union will work together in a spirit of cooperation to develop a mutually beneficial approach to this crucial economic sector in a globalized economy.
