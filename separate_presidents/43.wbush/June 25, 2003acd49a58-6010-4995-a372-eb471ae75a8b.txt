Joint Statement by President George W. Bush and European Council President Konstandinos Simitis and European Commission President Romano Prodi on the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction
Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their delivery systems constitutes a major threat to international peace and security. The threat is compounded by the interest of terrorists in acquiring WMD. This would undermine the foundations of international order. We pledge to use all means available to avert WMD proliferation and the calamities that would follow.
We welcome the statement on nonproliferation by European Union Heads of State and Government at Thessaloniki and the G8 Declaration of the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction. We reaffirm our joint commitment to relevant treaties and agreements, in particular the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. We will work together in all areas to stop and reverse proliferation.
In particular:
We will cooperate actively to address specific proliferation challenges. In particular:
Proliferation is a threat not only to our security, but also to the wider international system. We call for a halt to proliferation activities in a way that is demonstrable and verifiable. Nonproliferation is a global challenge which requires a multifaceted solution. We need to tackle it individually and collectivelyâ€”working together and with other partners, including through relevant international institutions, in particular those of the United Nations system.
