Statement Calling for Congressional Action on Foreign Sales Corporations/Extraterritorial Income Legislation
I urge Congress to take up and pass FSC/ETI legislation that reforms the Tax Code, removes the underlying reason for the tariffs that have been imposed today on American exports, and further advances the competitiveness of American manufacturers and job creators. Over the past 3 years, my administration has worked with Congress to further increase the ability of American companies to succeed in the worldwide economy, laying the foundation for increased growth and job creation. If we don't act to replace the current FSC/ ETI provisions in the Tax Code, the tariffs that have been imposed today will, over the next year, impose an increasing burden on American exporters, their workers, and the overall economy. To support the continued strengthening of our economy and to create more jobs, the Congress should act now to end the threat of these tariffs and promote the competitiveness of American manufacturers and other job-creating sectors of the U.S. economy.
