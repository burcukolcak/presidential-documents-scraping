Statement on Senator Fred Thompson's Decision Not To Seek Reelection
Senator Fred Thompson has served the people of Tennessee with honor, distinction, and class. He has worked tirelessly for Tennessee's interests, as well as for the
national interest. While I will miss Fred's service in the Senate, I wish him all the best and will always call him a friend.
