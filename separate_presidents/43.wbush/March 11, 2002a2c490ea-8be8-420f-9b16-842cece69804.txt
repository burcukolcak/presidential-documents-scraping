Remarks on the Unveiling of the September 11th United States Postage Stamp
The President.Welcome. We're about to unveil a stamp. It's an extraordinary piece of work. I want to thank the photographer here, and I want to thank Gary Ackerman for sponsoring it. This stamp will sell for 45 cents; 11 cents, obviously, more than the current price of a stamp. Eight cents will go to a victims fund to help those family members who are struggling in the aftermath of 9/11. It is a—it's a good gesture by the Postal Service. The Postmaster General is here, and I want to thank you for that very much.
Postmaster General John E. Potter.
Thank you, Mr. President.
The President.The three officers are here, and they're on the stamp. And I appreciate you all allowing your—allowing the Postal Service to use you as a way to help our Nation remember the terrible incident that took place 6 months ago and help people get their lives back in order.
And so it's with pleasure that we reveal the stamp.
[At this point, the stamp was unveiled.]
The President.Fabulous, good job, really good job.
