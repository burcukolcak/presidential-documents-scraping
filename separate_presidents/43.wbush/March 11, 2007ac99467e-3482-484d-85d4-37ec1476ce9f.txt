Remarks at a Luncheon Hosted By President Alvaro Uribe Velez of Colombia in Bogota, Colombia
Mr. President, thank you very much. I appreciate your hospitality. I am amazed by the beauty of your country. I've never been here to the beautiful capital city of your country, but Laura and I were struck by two things: the beauty of the landscape and the warmness of the people.
Weâ€”I bring greetings from the United States to the people of your country. We have been friends, and we shall remain friends. We value your democracy. I appreciate your strong leadership. We come during a period where your country has come through very difficult times, and now there's a brighter day ahead. And my message to the people of your country is, we want to help every individual realize their God-given potential.
I'd like to propose a toast to the people of this country and to the leadership of this country.Que Dios les bendiga.
