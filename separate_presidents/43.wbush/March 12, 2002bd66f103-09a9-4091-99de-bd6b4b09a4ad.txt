Statement on House of Representatives Action on Border Security Legislation
I applaud the House for working in a bipartisan fashion to pass legislation that strengthens border security while recognizing the importance of keeping families together and making America a more welcoming society. Many immigrants who are otherwise eligible to become legal residents will be forced to leave the United States and their families unless a temporary extension is granted. The Senate should act quickly to pass this legislation and send it to my desk for signature.
NOTE: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language version of this statement.
