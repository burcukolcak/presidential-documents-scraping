Remarks After Visiting Wounded Soldiers and Their Families at Walter Reed Army Medical Center
It is such an honor to come to a hospital like Walter Reed, for a couple of reasons. One is to meet the wounded who have made a decision to sacrifice for this Nation's security and for freedom in the world. It is an honor to meet their parents or their wives, their children—brave souls who support their loved one with all their heart.
It's an honor to be with the doctors and nurses of this fantastic facility who are doing unbelievable work in helping bring these people back on their feet, back into their communities.
One of the most important things for a Commander in Chief is to be able to say to a loved one, "If your son or daughter or husband or wife gets injured, you'll get the best possible care as quickly as possible." Every time I come to Walter Reed, it confirms that which I know, which is, we're providing the very best—the best care, the best compassion. We're moving these soldiers from the battlefield to hospitals as quickly as we can so they can begin their rehab.
And it's fantastic to go upstairs. The spirit is strong. The attitudes are terrific. Several soldiers told me today—badly injured soldiers—they want to get well quickly and get back on their duty stations in Iraq, want to serve our Nation.
It is so refreshing and great to be here. I want to thank you, General, for your hospitality.
NOTE: The President spoke at 3:05 p.m outside the main entrance. In his remarks, he referred to Maj. Gen. Kevin Kiley, USA, commanding general, North Atlantic Regional Medical Command and Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
