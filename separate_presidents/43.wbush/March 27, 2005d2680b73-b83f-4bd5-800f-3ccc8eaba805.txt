Remarks to Reporters at Fort Hood, Texas
I want to wish all the fellow citizens and their families a happy Easter. We prayed for peace. We prayed for our soldiers and their families. It's an honor to be here at Fort Hood to celebrate Easter with those who wear the Nation's uniform.
We wish you all a happy Easter too. Thank you.
