Statement on the Retirement of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis J. Freeh
Louis Freeh is a dedicated public servant who has served his country and the FBI with honor and distinction. I regret the Director is leaving Government. We are fortunate to have had a man of his caliber serve our country, and we will miss him.
