Remarks With Gubernatorial Candidate Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr., in South Bend, Indiana
I am proud to be standing by the side of my friend Mitch Daniels. Mitch is going to be the Governor of the State of Indiana, and I know for certain the people of this State will love this guy as their Governor. See, I've seen him firsthand. I know what it's like to work with Mitch. He's smart. He's capable. He's well organized. He's got a fabulous sense of humor.
I gave him a lot of tough jobs, and he did each of them with great professionalism and class. I know the people are going to the polls tomorrow in the primary. I'm not a voter in this State, Mitch, but if I were, I'd be voting for you, because I'll know you'll be a great Governor.
Do you want to say something?
