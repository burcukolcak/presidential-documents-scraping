Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National Emergency Blocking Property of Certain Persons and Prohibiting the Export of Certain Goods to Syria
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in theFederal Registerand transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice, stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13338 of May 11, 2004, blocking property of certain persons and prohibiting the exportation and reexportation of certain goods to Syria, is to continue in effect beyond May 11, 2005, to theFederal Registerfor publication.
The actions of the Government of Syria in supporting terrorism, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, undermining United States and international efforts with respect to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq, and with respect to Lebanon pose a continuing, unusual, and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue in effect the national emergency authorizing the blocking of property of certain persons and prohibiting the exportation and reexportation of certain goods to Syria, and to maintain in force the sanctions to respond to this threat.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
