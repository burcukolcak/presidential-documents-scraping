The report is comprised of two sections that provide the required information to the extent that such information is available. An unclassified section covering common NATO budgets, national defense budgets, costs incurred to date in connection with the membership of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and the status of discussions concerning NATO membership for Partnership for Peace countries. A separate, confidential section covers NATO members' capabilities to deploy and sustain combat forces and the adequacy of European defense budgets to meet the requirements of NATO force goals and capabilities initiatives.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
