Remarks Following Discussions With President Vaira Vike-Freiberga of Latvia in Riga
President Vike-Freiberga.We are, of course, very gratified at this sudden interest in Latvia that we're seeing among the journalists. [Laughter] And it's truly a great pleasure to see these wonderful journalists coming to my country and having a look around. And, Mr. President, I think that you have something to do with that. [Laughter]
President Bush.Well, thank you for having us, Madam President. It's been a trip I've really been anxious to fulfill. I admire your leadership; I admire your country's courage. I love the fact that you're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom. So, thanks for the hospitality.
President Vike-Freiberga.And we're pleased that the cameras are now turned on Latvia while you are here. [Laughter]
President Bush.That's right.
Q.Mr. President——
President Bush.Thank you all. We'll have ample opportunity in an open press conference. And I certainly wouldn't want you to fire your best question here. [Laughter]
