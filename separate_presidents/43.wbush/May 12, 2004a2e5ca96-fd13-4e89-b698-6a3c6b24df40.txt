Remarks on the Death of Nicholas Berg
I want to express my condolences to the family and friends of Nicholas Berg. Nicholas Berg was an innocent civilian who was in Iraq to help build a free Iraq. There is no justification for the brutal execution of Nicholas Bergâ€”no justification whatsoever.
The actions of the terrorists who executed this man remind us of the nature of the few people who want to stop the advance of freedom in Iraq. Their intention is to shake our will. Their intention is to shake our confidence. Yet, by their actions, they remind us of how desperately parts of the world need free societies and peaceful societies, and we will complete our mission. We will complete our task.
Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 1 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White House prior to his departure for Bethesda, MD. American hostage Nicholas Berg was killed in Iraq in early May by senior Al Qaida associate Abu Musab Al Zarqawi.
