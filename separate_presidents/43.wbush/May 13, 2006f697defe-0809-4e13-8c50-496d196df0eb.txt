Statement on the Death of Eusebio Penalver Mazorra
Eusebio Penalver Mazorra was a Cuban patriot who spent 28 years in Castro's prisons. His resistance to tyranny is a testament to the moral courage of all Cubans who desire to see freedom return to their beautiful island nation. Laura joins me in sending our thoughts and prayers to his family and friends.
