Radio Remarks to the People of Cuba on Cuban Independence Day
Today, Cubans around the world celebrate May 20th, Cuban Independence Day. On behalf of the people of the United States, I send greetings to the Cuban community. My hope is for the Cuban people to soon enjoy the same freedoms and rights that we do. Dictatorships have no place in the Americas. May God bless the Cuban people who are struggling for freedom. Thank you.
NOTE: The President's remarks were recorded in Spanish at 9:50 a.m. on May 16 in the Cabinet Room at the White House for later broadcast on Radio Marti. The Spanish language transcript and an English translation were released by the Office of the Press Secretary on May 20. This text follows the English translation.
