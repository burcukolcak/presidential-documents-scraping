Remarks on the Earthquake in China
Laura and I have come to the Chinese Embassy. Mr. Ambassador, thank you very much. Madam, thank you very much. We've come to express our country's condolences for those who mourn for the loved ones.
We stand ready to help in any way that the Chinese Government would like. We know there's great courage being displayed, Mr. Ambassador, as rescue workers search for those who may still be living.
This natural disaster is very hard on many of your people, and we understand that. And we extend our deepest sympathies and pray for recovery and pray for the strength of those who areâ€”whose lives have been torn apart during this terrible tragedy.
Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 10:13 a.m. at the Embassy of China. In his remarks, he referred to China's Ambassador to the U.S. Zhou Wenzhong and his wife Xie Shumin.
