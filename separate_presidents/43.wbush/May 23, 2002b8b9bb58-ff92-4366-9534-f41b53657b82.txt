Statement on Congressional Action on Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Legislation
I applaud members of both parties, including Congressmen Tauzin and Dingell and Senators Kennedy, Gregg, and Frist, for acting on my proposals to protect Americans against bioterrorism. This legislation strengthens food safety and security, improves the ability of Federal, State, and local authorities to coordinate their response to possible bioterrorist attacks, and enhances surveillance and security over dangerous biological agents.
I commend the House and Senate for their hard work and look forward to signing this important bipartisan legislation into law.
NOTE: The statement referred to H.R. 3448, the proposed "Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002."
