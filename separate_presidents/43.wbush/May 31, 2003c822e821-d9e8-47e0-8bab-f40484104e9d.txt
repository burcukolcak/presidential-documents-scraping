Remarks to Journalists in Auschwitz, Poland
Laura and I have just toured Auschwitz I, and what they call Auschwitz II, a place where millions were murdered. The sites are a sobering reminder thatâ€”of the power of evil and the need for people to resist evil. This site is a sobering reminder that when we find anti-Semitism, whether it be in Europe or anywhere else, mankind must come together to fight such dark impulses.
And this site is also a strong reminder that the civilized world must never forget what took place on this site.
May God bless the victims and the families of the victims, and may we always remember.
Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at approximately 9:30 a.m. following a tour of World War II Nazi concentration camp sites. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
