Statement on Agriculture Appropriations Legislation
The agriculture appropriations bill meets important priorities and holds spending below last year's level. This legislation is an important step forward in our efforts to rein in spending while maintaining our commitment to America's farmers and consumers. By pursuing progrowth economic policies and restraining spending, we can stay on track to meet my goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009.
NOTE: The statement referred to H.R. 2744, approved November 10, which was assigned Public Law No. 109-97.
