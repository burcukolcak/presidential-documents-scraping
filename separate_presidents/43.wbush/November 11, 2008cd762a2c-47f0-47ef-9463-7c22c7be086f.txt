Remarks on Arrival in New York City
Veterans Day
As you can see, I have the honor of traveling with men and women who have volunteered to serve our Nation in a time of war. Behind me are five outstanding Americans representing each branch of the military service. I am with them today because we are celebrating Veterans Day.
Veterans have inspired troops such as these; veterans have inspired me. I was raised by a veteran. I appreciate the commitment to our country that the veterans have made. I am committed to making sure that today's veterans get all the health care and support they need from the Federal Government for agreeing to serve in a time of danger.
Our Nation is blessed because our liberties have been defended by brave men and women in the past. And we are blessed to have brave men and women defend our liberties today.
God bless our veterans. Thank you.
