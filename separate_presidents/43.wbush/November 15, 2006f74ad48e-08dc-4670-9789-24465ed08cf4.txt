Letter to Congressional Leaders Certifying Exports to the People's Republic of China
Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261), I hereby certify that the export to the People's Republic of China of the following items are not detrimental to the U.S. space launch industry and that the material and equipment, including any indirect technical benefit that could be derived from such exports, will not measurably improve the missile or space launch capabilities of the People's Republic of China:
• 110,000 pounds of fine grain bulk graphite to be distributed to seven companies in the People's Republic of China for machining into industrial components; and
• A motorized mixer with a stainless steel vacuum mixing tank to Dow Corning (Shanghai) Company in the People's Republic of China.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH
