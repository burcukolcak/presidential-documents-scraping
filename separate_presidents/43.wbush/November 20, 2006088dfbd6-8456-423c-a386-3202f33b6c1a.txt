Remarks Following a Tour of the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City
Laura and I are honored to be here at the center of an effort to help Vietnam battle HIV/AIDS. And, doctor, thank you for this wonderful tour. We've got a comprehensive strategy involved through our PEPFAR program with the country. We've got a very strong mother-to-child transmission program to prevent the children from developing HIV/AIDS.
The doctor has been explaining to us their strategy on how to detect HIV/AIDS not only in the cities but in the Provinces. And part of our comprehensive strategy to help this country is to distribute antiretroviral drugs.
Laura and I have come by to thank the doctor and her staff for their compassionate work and to assure the Vietnamese people that we will still help them fight HIV/ AIDS.
NOTE: The President spoke at 10:29 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to Nguyen Thi Kim Tien, director, Pasteur Institute.
