Statement on House of Representatives Action on Medicare Reform Legislation
The House's historic passage of the bipartisan Medicare bill brings seniors one step closer to a modern Medicare system, one that includes prescription drugs and choices for seniors. I applaud the House for meeting our obligations to America's seniors. Now it is time for the Senate to act. I urge the Senate to pass this good piece of legislation so that I can sign it into law.
NOTE: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language version of this statement.
