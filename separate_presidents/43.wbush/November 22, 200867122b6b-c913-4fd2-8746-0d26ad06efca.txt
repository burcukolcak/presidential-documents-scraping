Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Dmitry A. Medvedev of Russia in Lima
President Bush.It's an interesting moment because I've had a lot of meetings with Dmitry and Vladimir Putin. This will be my last meeting as the sitting President with the leader of Russia. We've had our agreements; we've had our disagreements. I've tried to work hard to make it a cordial relationship though, so that when we need to work together we can and when we disagree we're able to do so in a way that is respectful to our two nations.
I thank you for coming by today and appreciate your time.
President Medvedev.Thank you very much, George. And in general, though we do have points of agreements and those points of real differences, positions, we are prepared for the continuous work. And I view that, in general, our work was successful.
President Bush.Thankâ€”[laughter].
