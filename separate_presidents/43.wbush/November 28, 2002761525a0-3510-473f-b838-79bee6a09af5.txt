Videotaped Remarks for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade
Good morning. As we gather to celebrate Thanksgiving, let us remember to share our blessings and make this holiday season a time for giving to those in need. By helping a neighbor, we serve our Nation, and we serve a cause greater than self-interest. Everyone can do something. And through the USA Freedom Corps, you can find ways to help at a school, a food pantry, or any other organization near you.
Macy's and NBC join me in wishing you a happy Thanksgiving, and we ask you to make this holiday the start of a season of service.
Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President's remarks were videotaped at 3:10 p.m. on November 12 in the Map Room at the White House for broadcast during the telecast of the November 28 parade. The transcript was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on November 26. The Thanksgiving Day proclamation of November 21 is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
