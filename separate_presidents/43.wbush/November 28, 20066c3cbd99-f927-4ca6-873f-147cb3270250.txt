Remarks Following a Meeting With Proponents of Democracy in Tallinn
It's an amazing country you have here. They've got an e-government system that should be the envy of a lot of nations. They've got a tax system that is transparent, open, and simple; people file their taxes over the Internet.
You're doing a fine job, Mr. Prime Minister. I'm proud of you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 10:31 a.m. at the Stenbock House. In his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister Andrus Ansip of Estonia.
