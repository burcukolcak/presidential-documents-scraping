Remarks Following a Visit to the Treasury Department
The President.I just had the honor of talking to Treasury Department employees. I thanked them for their hard work over the past 6 weeks in dealing with a serious financial crisis.
I do want to thank the Secretary too. Mr. Secretary, you and your team have worked incredibly hard. You've worked with the Congress; you've worked with the financial markets, both domestically and internationally. I know that your people are exhausted in there, and I'm—really appreciate the fact that I'm going to sign a piece of legislation that'll be a part of solving this crisis—an important part of solving the crisis.
And so I just went up to thank people. Sometimes people in Government never get thanked enough for all the hours they keep. And I've got a lot of confidence in you, Mr. Secretary, and your team. And I want to thank you for giving me a chance to come by, and looking forward to getting this plan in place. I just told the people in the Rose Garden that, you know, it's complicated, and we're going to make sure that whatever we do is done in a deliberate fashion and one that will be effective and be mindful of the taxpayers. Appreciate serving with you.
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr.Thank you very much.
The President.Appreciate serving with you. Thank you all.
