Remarks on the United Nations Security Council Resolution on North Korea
Today the United Nations Security Council passed a unanimous resolution, sending a clear message to the leader of North Korea regarding his weapons programs. This action by the United Nations, which was swift and tough, says that we are united in our determination to see to it that the Korean Peninsula is nuclearweapons free.
I have said all along there is a better way forward for North Korea. There's a better way forward for the people of North Korea. If the leader of North Korea were to verifiably end his weapons programs, the United States and other nations would be willing to help the nation recover economically.
The message today, however, says to the leader of North Korea that the world is united in our opposition to his nuclear weapons plans.
Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 3:30 p.m. on the South Grounds at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Chairman Kim Jong Il of North Korea. He also referred to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1718.
