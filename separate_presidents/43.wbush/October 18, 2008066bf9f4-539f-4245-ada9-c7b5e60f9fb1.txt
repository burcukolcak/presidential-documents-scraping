Joint Statement by the United States and the European Union on the Global Economy
The three leaders had a very positive discussion about the continued coordination of steps needed to solve the crisis in today's global economy. They agreed they would reach out to other world leaders next week with the idea of beginning a series of summits on addressing the challenges facing the global economy.
World leaders will be consulted about the idea of a first summit of heads of government to be held in the U.S. soon after the U.S. elections, in order to review progress being made to address the current crisis and to seek agreement on principles of reform needed to avoid a repetition and assure global prosperity in the future. Later summits would be designed to implement agreement on specific steps to be taken to meet those principles.
NOTE: The statement referred to President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, in his capacity as President of the European Council; and President Jose Manuel Durao Barroso of the European Commission. An original was not available for verification of the content of this joint statement.
