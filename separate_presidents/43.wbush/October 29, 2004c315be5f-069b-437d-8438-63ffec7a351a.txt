Remarks on Al Jazeera Videotape of Usama bin Laden
Earlier today I was informed of the tape that is now being analyzed by America's intelligence community. Let me make this very clear: Americans will not be intimidated or influenced by an enemy of our country. I'm sure Senator Kerry agrees with this.
I also want to say to the American people that we're at war with these terrorists, and I am confident that we will prevail.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 5:53 p.m. at the Toledo Express Airport in Toledo, OH. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
