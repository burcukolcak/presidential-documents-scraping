Message to the Congress Transmitting a Notification of Intent To Designate Iraq as a Beneficiary Developing Country for Purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences
To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to section 502(f) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "1974 Act"), I am writing to inform you of my intent to designate Iraq as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).
I have considered the criteria set forth in sections 501 and 502 of the 1974 Act. In light of these criteria, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Iraq.
GEORGE W. BUSH
The White House, September 7, 2004.
NOTE: The proclamation of September 7 to modify the Generalized System of Preferences is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
