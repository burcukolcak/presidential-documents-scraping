Statement on Congressional Action on Emergency Funding for Hurricane Katrina Recovery Efforts
I thank Congress for continuing to help those affected by Hurricane Katrina by moving swiftly and in strong bipartisan fashion to approve these additional emergency funds. The people affected by this storm have immediate needs that we must continue to meet without delay. More resources will be needed as we work to help people get back on their feet. We will continue to help people rebuild their lives and rebuild the region.
