Remarks on the National Football League's Opening Day Coin Toss
We're here in the Rose Garden to help kick off the NFL's 82d season. This is a great day for fans. And I want to salute the NFL for its long history, lasting influence, and the quality of its athletes.
I'm glad to be joined by members of Washington's Metropolitan Police Boys and Girls Clubâ€”all future NFL greats.
And now, to officially begin the NFL's 82d season, the coin toss. This is heads. This is tails. Here we go.
[At this point, the President tossed the coin.]
It's tails.
I wish the players of the NFL good health, and have a great season.
NOTE: The President spoke at 1:01 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
