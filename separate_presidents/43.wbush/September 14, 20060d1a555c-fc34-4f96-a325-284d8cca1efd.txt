Remarks to Reporters Following a Meeting With the House Republican Conference
Thank you very much. It's an honor to meet with the Capitol press corps, and a few White House—a few White House folks scattered in. Just had a great visit with House Members—House Republican Members. I talked about a lot of issues and answered questions. I thanked them for the House Armed Services Committee passing a very important piece of legislation in a bipartisan fashion that will give us the tools and wherewithal to protect this country. I reminded them that the most important job of Government is to protect the homeland, and yesterday they advanced an important piece of legislation to do just that. I'll continue to work with Members of the Congress to get good legislation so we can do our duty.
It's nice seeing you all. Thank you very much.
NOTE: The President spoke at 10:44 a.m. at the U.S. Capitol. In his remarks, he referred to H.R. 6054, the ''Military Commissions Act of 2006.'' A tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
