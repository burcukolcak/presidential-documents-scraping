Statement on the Recommendations of the National Commission on Election Reform
I greatly appreciate the excellent work of the bipartisan commission in identifying ways to strengthen the integrity of the voting process. It is critical to maintain America's trust in our election system, and I look forward to reviewing this report and working with Congress on the recommendations.
