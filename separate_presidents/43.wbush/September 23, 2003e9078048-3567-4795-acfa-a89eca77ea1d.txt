Remarks Prior to Discussions With President Jose Maria Aznar of Spain in New York City
President Bush.It's my honor to visit again with my very close friend, a great friend of our country, Jose Maria Aznar. Jose Maria is a very strong leader who's got a vision that's based upon the principles of human dignity and freedom.
And we'll spend time talking about Iraq. We're both convinced and strongly believe that our goals in Iraq are the right goals, and we'll accomplished the goals.
He's a steadfast friend, and I'm so proud to be with you again.
[At this point, President Aznar spoke in Spanish, and no translation was provided.]
President Bush.Thank you, sir.
