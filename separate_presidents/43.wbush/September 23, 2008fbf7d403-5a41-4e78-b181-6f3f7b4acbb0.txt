Remarks at a Dinner Hosted by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations in New York City
Mr. Secretary-General, this is my eighth chance to welcome you to New York, and I'm honored to do so. You did mention, I'm heading into retirement—[laughter]—but it has been a joy to work with you, the staff, and many of the leaders here in this hall.
It is my honor to propose a toast, Mr. Secretary-General, to you and to your hard work. May God bless all in the room, and, Mr. Secretary-General, may God continue to bless you, sir.
NOTE: The President spoke at 7:45 p.m. at United Nations Headquarters. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included the remarks of Secretary-General Ban.
