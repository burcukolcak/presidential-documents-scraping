Statement on Congressional Action on the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement
I commend the Congress for advancing trade and relations with Jordan, a valued friend and partner. The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement will promote peace and security in the region, while creating jobs and new investment opportunities in both countries. The agreement demonstrates Jordan's strong commitment to economic reform and sends a strong signal to Jordan, as well as other countries in the region, that support for peace and economic reform yields concrete benefits. I look forward to signing this important legislation.
NOTE: The related proclamation of December 7 to implement the agreement is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
