Joint Statement Between the United States of America and Russia Regarding Negotiations on Further Reductions in Strategic Offensive Arms

Medvedev, noted that the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (START Treaty), which expires in December 2009, has completely fulfilled its intended purpose and that the maximum levels for strategic offensive arms recorded in the Treaty were reached long ago. They have therefore decided to move further along the path of reducing and limiting strategic offensive arms in accordance with U.S. and Russian obligations under Article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

The United States and the Russian Federation intend to conclude this agreement before the Treaty expires in December.
