Exchange With Reporters in Prague
The President.Hello, everybody. I hope you're not tired of me by now.
Q.Sir, what's your message for North Korea, please?
Situation in North Korea
The President.We delivered it today. They, I think, have taken a provocative action. It creates instability in their region, around the world. If they want to take an appropriate path to rejoin the international community and break out of their isolation, that's available to them. That's not the path they're taking right now. And we intend to work with the international community to deliver a strong message.
Note: The President spoke at 11:39 a.m. at the Prague Congress Center. Audio was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
