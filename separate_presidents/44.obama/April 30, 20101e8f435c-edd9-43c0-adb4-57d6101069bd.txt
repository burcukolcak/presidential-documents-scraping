Statement on the Accident at the Dotiki Mine in Providence, Kentucky
I am deeply saddened by the loss of two miners in Kentucky, and my thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones they left behind. As I said after the tragedy in West Virginia, I refuse to accept any number of miner deaths as simply the cost of mining. It is the responsibility of all of us, from mine operators to the Federal Government, to prevent such tragedies from happening again. That is why my administration is taking steps to demand accountability for safety violations and strengthen mine safety so that all of our miners are protected.
Note: The statement referred to coal miners Justin Travis and Michael Carter, who were killed in the accident on April 29.
