Statement on the Detention of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma
The conviction and sentencing of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi today on charges related to an uninvited intrusion into her home violate universal principles of human rights, run counter to Burma's commitments under the ASEAN charter, and demonstrate continued disregard for U.N. Security Council statements. I join the international community in calling for Aung San Suu Kyi's immediate unconditional release.
Today's unjust decision reminds us of the thousands of other political prisoners in Burma who, like Aung San Suu Kyi, have been denied their liberty because of their pursuit of a government that respects the will, rights, and aspirations of all Burmese citizens. They too should be freed. Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. I call on the Burmese regime to heed the views of its own people and the international community and to work towards genuine national reconciliation.
I am also concerned by the sentencing of American citizen John Yettaw to 7 years in prison, a punishment out of proportion with his actions.
Note: The statement referred to John Yettaw, who was arrested on May 5 by Burmese authorities for entering the home of Aung San Suu Kyi in Rangoon, Burma.
