Statement on Representative James D. Matheson's Decision Not To Seek Reelection
Jim Matheson has proudly represented the people of Utah for more than 12 years in the United States Congress. He has been a forceful advocate of our Nation's veterans and worked to strengthen our economy through his support of key trade agreements. Michelle and I thank Congressman Matheson for his service and wish him, his wife Amy, and their two sons the very best in the future.
NOTE: The statement referred to Will and Harris Matheson, sons of Rep. Matheson.
