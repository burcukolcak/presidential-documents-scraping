Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on North Korea
Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to section 1255 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111-84), and in order to keep the Congress fully informed, I am providing a classified report prepared by my Administration. This report includes information on our examination of the conduct of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) from June 26, 2008, through November 16, 2009, and concludes that the DPRK does not meet the statutory criteria to again be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.
Sincerely,
BARACK OBAMA
Note: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the Senate.
