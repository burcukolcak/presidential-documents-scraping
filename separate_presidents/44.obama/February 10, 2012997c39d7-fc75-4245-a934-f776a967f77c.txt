Statement on Signing the Ultralight Aircraft Smuggling Prevention Act of 2012
This bill gives our Nation's law enforcement expanded authority to combat illicit drug trafficking on our northern and southern borders, and being able to sign it next to my friend Gabby Giffords gives me enormous pride. She has spent her career fighting for the safety of the people of Arizona and the fact that it passed unanimously shows just how much Gabby is respected by her colleagues in Congress in both parties. Her dedication to fairness and to this country has been an inspiration to so many, including myself. I wished Gabby well in her recovery and told her that I expect to see more of her in the months and years to come. I'm confident that while this legislation may have been her last act as a Congresswoman, it will not be her last act of public service.
Note: The statement referred to former Rep. Gabrielle D. Giffords. H.R. 3801, approved February 10, was assigned Public Law No. 112-93.
