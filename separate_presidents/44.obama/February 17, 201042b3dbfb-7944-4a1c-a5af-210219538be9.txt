Statement on the Observance of Ash Wednesday
Michelle and I join Christians here in America and around the world in observing Ash Wednesday. We mark this solemn day of repentance and promise knowing that Lent is a time for millions to renew faith and also deepen a commitment to loving and serving one another.
