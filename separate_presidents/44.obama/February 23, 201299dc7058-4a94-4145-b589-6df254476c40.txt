Remarks During a Tour of the Industrial Assessment Center at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida
This is for background because you guys just came in. What this facility does is teach these outstanding young engineers how to do energy assessments for manufacturers--industrial buildings across the board. And so far they have--how many?--200 assessments, saving these companies up to 25 percent in their energy usage. And that's going to end up saving them millions of dollars.
So it's a great example of how people are being trained right now to make our businesses more energy efficient all across the country.
All right.
Note: The President spoke at 1:55 p.m. in the McArthur Engineering Building. Audio was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
