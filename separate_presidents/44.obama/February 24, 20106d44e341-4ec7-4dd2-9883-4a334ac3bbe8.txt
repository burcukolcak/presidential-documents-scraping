Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Health Insurance Industry Fair Competition Legislation
I applaud the House of Representatives for passing the "Health Insurance Industry Fair Competition Act" on a strong bipartisan vote today. This bill will help ensure that insurers abide by commonsense rules that prevent bid rigging, price fixing, and other practices that drive up health care costs for the American people.
Repealing the antitrust exemption for health insurers is an important step toward achieving reform that gives families and business owners greater control over their health care. I look forward to meeting with congressional leaders tomorrow to continue this critical discussion.
Note: The statement referred to H.R. 4626.
