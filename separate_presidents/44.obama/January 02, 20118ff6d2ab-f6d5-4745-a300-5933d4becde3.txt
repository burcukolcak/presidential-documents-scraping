Statement on Signing the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010
I was honored to sign the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act to ensure that rescue and recovery workers, residents, students, and others suffering from health consequences related to the World Trade Center disaster have access to the medical monitoring and treatment they need. We will never forget the selfless courage demonstrated by the firefighters, police officers, and first-responders who risked their lives to save others. I believe this is a critical step for those who continue to bear the physical scars of those attacks.
Note: H.R. 847, approved January 2, was assigned Public Law No. 111-347.
