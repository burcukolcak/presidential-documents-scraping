Statement on a Meeting on the Situation in Iraq
This afternoon I met with our Ambassador to Iraq, the commander in Iraq, and the overall theater commander in the region in order to get a full update on the situation in Iraq. Key members of my Cabinet and senior national security officials also participated in this meeting.
The meeting was productive, and I very much appreciated receiving assessments from these experienced and dedicated individuals. During the discussion, I asked the military leadership to engage in additional planning necessary to execute a responsible military drawdown from Iraq.
In the coming days and weeks, I will also visit the Department of Defense to consult with the Joint Chiefs on these issues, and we will undertake a full review of the situation in Afghanistan in order to develop a comprehensive policy for the entire region.
Note: The statement referred to Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, USA, commanding general, Multi-National Forces--Iraq; and Gen. David H. Petraeus, USA, commander, U.S. Central Command.
