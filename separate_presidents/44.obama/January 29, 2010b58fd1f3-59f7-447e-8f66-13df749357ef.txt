Message on the Observance of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Day of Remembrance
For more than a half century, NASA has explored our final frontier and transformed humankind's understanding of our planet and its place in the universe. These extraordinary achievements have required great sacrifice.
On this day of remembrance, we pause to reflect on the Apollo 1,Challenger, andColumbiacrews, as well as others who lost their lives supporting NASA's mission of exploration and study of the Earth, the planets, and the stars. All of humanity has benefited from their courage and devotion.
We mourn their loss while celebrating their spirit of discovery. May their sacrifice be an inspiration as we continue our Nation's work to explore our universe.
