Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Financial Regulators
We got everybody? All right, well, we're looking forward to a constructive conversation with these outstanding regulators and supervisors who have helped us design how we're going to approach a critical problem in our economy. I'll have more to say about it this afternoon, but I want to publicly thank them for their service to the country.
All right, thanks, guys.
