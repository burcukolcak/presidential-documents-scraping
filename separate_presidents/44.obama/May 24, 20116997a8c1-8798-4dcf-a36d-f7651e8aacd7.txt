Statement on the Election of Kathleen C. Hochul to the United States House of Representatives
I want to extend my congratulations to Congresswoman-elect Kathy Hochul for her victory in New York's 26th Congressional District. Kathy and I both believe that we need to create jobs, grow our economy, and reduce the deficit in order to outcompete other nations and win the future. Kathy has shown through her victory and throughout her career that she will fight for the families and businesses in western New York, and I look forward to working with her when she gets to Washington.
