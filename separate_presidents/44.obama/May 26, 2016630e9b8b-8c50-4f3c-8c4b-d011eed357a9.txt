Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report and Classified Annex on an Integrated Policy To Deter Adversaries in Space

I transmit herewith, in accordance with section 1613 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114-92), the report and classified annex on an integrated policy to deter adversaries in space.
The report is the result of an interagency process with the objectives to reduce risks to the United States and our allies in space; and to protect and preserve the rights, access, capabilities, use, and freedom of action of the United States in space. Success will require a multi-year effort and commitment across all departments and agencies, and I look forward to your continued support.
Sincerely,
BARACK OBAMA
