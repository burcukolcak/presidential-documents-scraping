Remarks to an Overflow Crowd at a Campaign Rally for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in Jacksonville, Florida
The President.Thank you. So I'm so sorry that we can't fit everybody in, but I just wanted to come by and say thank you. Thank you.
I'm proud of all of you. I'm so grateful for everything you've done to support me. Except, we've got a couple guys with the Trump—you're at the wrong rally. [Laughter]
Audience members.Boo!
The President.No, no, no, it's good. But I just want you—I just want everybody out there to know that I couldn't have done what we've done without you. And Hillary Clinton won't be able to do what she needs to do without you, so I need everybody to go out there and vote. We've only got 5 days left, so don't hold anything back.
And I know if you're at this rally, you probably voted. But I want to—talk to your cousins, your neighbors, your friends, your uncles, folks at the barbershop, at the beauty shop. Make sure every single person out there makes their voice heard in this critical election.
I love you, guys. Let's get to work. Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 3:29 p.m. in the Field House of the University of North Florida Arena at the University of North Florida. In his remarks, he referred to Republican Presidential nominee Donald J. Trump.
