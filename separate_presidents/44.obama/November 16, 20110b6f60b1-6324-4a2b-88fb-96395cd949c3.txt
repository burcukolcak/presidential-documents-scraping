Statement on Congressional Passage of Legislation To Provide Tax Credits To Aid Businesses Hiring Veterans
I want to congratulate Republicans and Democrats in Congress for coming together to pass these tax credits that will encourage businesses to hire America's veterans. No veteran who fought for our country should have to fight for a job when they come home. That's why I proposed these tax credits back in August, and I look forward to signing them into law. This is a good first step, but it is only a step. Congress needs to pass the rest of my "American Jobs Act" so that we can create jobs and put money in the pockets of the middle class.
Note: The statement referred to H.R. 674.
