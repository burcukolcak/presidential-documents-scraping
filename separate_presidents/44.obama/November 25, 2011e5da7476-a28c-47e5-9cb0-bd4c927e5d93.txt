Statement on the Death of Margaret C. Daley
Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Maggie Daley. Maggie was an extraordinary woman who dedicated her life to public service. While she will be sorely missed, her initiatives on behalf of Chicago's youth live on as national models for how to create environments for children to learn and grow outside the classroom. Maggie's commitment to the children and people of Chicago was surpassed only by her devotion to her family. Tonight our thoughts and prayers are with Mayor Daley, Nora, Patrick, Lally, and the entire Daley family.
Note: The statement referred to former Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago, husband, and Nora Daley Conroy, Patrick Daley, and Elizabeth "Lally" Daley, children, of Mrs. Daley.
