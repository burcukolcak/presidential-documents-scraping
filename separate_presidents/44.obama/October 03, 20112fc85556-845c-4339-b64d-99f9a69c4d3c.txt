Message to the Congress Transmitting Legislation To Implement the United States-South Korea Free Trade Agreement
To the Congress of the United States:
By separate message, I have transmitted to the Congress a bill to approve and implement the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement. In that message, I highlighted new commitments that my Administration, in close coordination with the Congress, successfully negotiated to provide additional market access and a level playing field for American auto manufacturers and workers exporting to Korea.
Herewith I am transmitting the letters exchanged between the United States and Korea that contain those commitments, which further enhance the most commercially significant trade agreement the United States has concluded in more than 17 years. The documents I have transmitted in these two messages constitute the entire United States-Korea trade agreement package.
