Noticeâ€”Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Export Control Regulations
On August 17, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13222 pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701et seq.). In that order, the President declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States related to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4601et seq.). Because the Congress has not renewed the Export Administration Act, the national emergency declared on August 17, 2001, must continue in effect beyond August 17, 2018. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622 (d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13222, as amended by Executive Order 13637 of March 8, 2013.
This notice shall be published in theFederal Registerand transmitted to the Congress.
