Statement on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth District Ruling Regarding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
Today's decision inTexasv.Azaris a win for all Americans and confirms what I have said all along: that the individual mandate, by far the worst element of Obamacare, is unconstitutional.
This decision will not alter the current health care system. My administration continues to work to provide access to high-quality health care at a price you can afford, while strongly protecting those with preexisting conditions. The radical health care changes being proposed by the far left would strip Americans of their current coverage. I will not let this happen. Providing affordable, high-quality health care will always be my priority. They are trying to take away your health care, and I am trying to give the American people the best health care in the world.
