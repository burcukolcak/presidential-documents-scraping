Remarks With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan to Reporters in Palm Beach, Florida
Prime Minister Abe.North Korea's most recent missile launch is absolutely intolerable. North Korea must fully comply with the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.
During the summit meeting that I had with President Trump, he assured me that the United States will alwaysâ€”with Japan 100 percent. And to demonstrate his determination, as well as commitment, he is now here with me at this joint press conference.
President Trump and I myself completely share the view that we are going to promote further collaboration between the two nations, and also, we are going to further reinforce our alliance. That is all from myself.
President Trump.Thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister. I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 percent. Thank you.
NOTE: The President spoke at 10:38 p.m. at the Mar-a-Lago Club. Prime Minister Abe spoke in Japanese, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter.
