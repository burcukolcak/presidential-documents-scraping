The Department of Defense will take actions to develop and purchase equipment and materials needed for expanding the domestic production capability for energetic materials for munitions.
I have also included my determination required pursuant to section 303(a)(5) of the Act. These proposed initiatives are essential to the national defense.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
