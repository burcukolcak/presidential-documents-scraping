Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Legislation To Combat Human Trafficking
My administration is focused on ending the horrific practice of human trafficking, and the three bills the House of Representatives passed today are important steps forward. Since taking office, I have met with courageous survivors, nonprofit groups, and faith leaders who are devoting tremendous energy to raising awareness about human trafficking. I am hopeful that the Senate will take up and pass these three bills as soon as possible, and I look forward to my continued work with the Congress on this important issue.
NOTE: The statement referred to H.R. 2200, H.R. 2480, and H.R. 2664.
