Statement on Senate Action on Health Care Reform Legislation
I applaud the Senate for taking a giant step to end the Obamacare nightmare. As this vote shows, inaction is not an option, and now the legislative process can move forward, as intended, to produce a bill that lowers costs and increases options for all Americans. The Senate must now pass a bill and get it to my desk so we can finally end the Obamacare disaster once and for all.
NOTE: The statement referred to H.R. 1628.
