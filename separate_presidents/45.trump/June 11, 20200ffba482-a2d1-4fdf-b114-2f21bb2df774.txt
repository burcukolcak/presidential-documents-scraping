Letter to Congressional Leaders on Blocking Property of Certain Persons Associated With the International Criminal Court
Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) (50 U.S.C. 1701et seq.) and the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601et seq.), I hereby report I have issued an Executive Order (the "order") that declares a national emergency with respect to the attempts by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to assert authority over United States personnel without the consent of the United States, and over personnel of countries that are allies of the United States without these governments' consent.
The order blocks the property and interests in property of foreign persons determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General:
I have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the authority to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement the order.
Under section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), the order also suspends the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens, and their immediate family members, and persons designated by the Secretary of State to be employed by, or acting as an agent of, the ICC.
I am enclosing a copy of the order I have issued.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
