Remarks and an Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Chairman of the State Affairs Commission Kim Jong Un of North Korea on Sentosa Island, Singapore
Q.Mr. President, how do you feel at this time?
President Trump.I feel really great. We're going to have a great discussion and, I think, tremendous success. It will be tremendously successful. And it's my honor. And we will have a terrific relationshipâ€”I have no doubt.
Chairman Kim.Well, it was not easy to get here. The past worked as fetters on our limbs, and the old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles on our way forward. But we overcame all of them, and we are here today.
President Trump.That's true.
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Chairman Kim.Thank you.
