Statement on the Death of Otto F. Warmbier
Melania and I offer our deepest condolences to the family of Otto Warmbier on his untimely passing. There is nothing more tragic for a parent than to lose a child in the prime of life. Our thoughts and prayers are with Otto's family and friends and all who loved him.
Otto's fate deepens my administration's determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency. The United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim.
NOTE: The statement referred to Otto F. Warmbier, a University of Virginia student from Wyoming, OH, who was returned from 17 months of detention by North Korean authorities on June 13.
