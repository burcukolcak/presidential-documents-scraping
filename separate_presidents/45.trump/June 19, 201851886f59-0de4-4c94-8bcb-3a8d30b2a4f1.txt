Statement on the Resignation of White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Joseph W. Hagin
Joe Hagin has been a huge asset to my administration. He planned and executed the longest—and one of the most historic—foreign trips ever made by a President, and he did it all perfectly. We will miss him in the office and even more on the road. I am thankful for his remarkable service to our great country.
