Remarks Prior to an Expanded Bilateral Meeting With Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India
President Trump.Thank you very much. It's a great honor to have Prime Minister Modi with us, his representatives. We've had a lot of discussions already. I think we're making great progress. The relationship between the United States and India is very, very strong and very, very powerful. We agree on most things, and I would say by the end of the day, we'll agree on everything, I have a feeling. [Laughter]
But I just want to tell you, Mr. Prime Minister, it was a great honor to have you in the United States. Thank you. Thank you for being here.
[At this point, Prime Minister Modi made brief remarks in Hindi, and no transcript of the translation was provided. President Trump then spoke as follows.]
President Trump.Well, thank you very much. And thank you very much for the equipmentâ€”ordering equipment from the United States. Always makes us feel very good. And there's nobody makes military equipment like we make military equipment. Nobody even close. So we want to thank you very much. And we look forward to getting on with the meeting. Thank you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
