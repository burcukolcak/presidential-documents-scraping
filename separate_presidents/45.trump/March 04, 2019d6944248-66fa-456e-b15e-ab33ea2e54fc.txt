Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Generalized System of Preferences Program Benefits of India
Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
In accordance with section 502(f)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(2)), I am providing notice of my intent to terminate the designation of India as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program.
I am taking this step because, after intensive engagement between the United States and the Government of India, I have determined that India has not assured the United States that it will provide equitable and reasonable access to the markets of India as set forth in section 502(c)(4) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(4)).
I will continue to assess whether the Government of India is providing equitable and reasonable access to its markets, in accordance with the GSP eligibility criteria.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
NOTE: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Michael R. Pence, President of the Senate.
