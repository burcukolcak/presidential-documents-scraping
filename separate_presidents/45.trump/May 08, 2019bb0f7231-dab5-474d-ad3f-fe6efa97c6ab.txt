Message to the Congress on Imposing Sanctions With Respect to the Iron, Steel, Aluminum, and Copper Sectors of Iran
To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order (the "order") with respect to Iran that takes additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995, and to supplement the authorities provided in the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 (subtitle D of title XII of Public Law 112-239).
The order takes steps to deny Iran revenue, including revenue derived from the export of products from Iran's iron, steel, aluminum, and copper sectors, that may be used to provide funding and support for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorist groups and networks, campaigns of regional aggression, and military expansion.
The order blocks the property and interests in property of persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:

The order also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to impose correspondent and payable-through account-related sanctions on a foreign financial institution upon determining the foreign financial institution has, on or after the date of the order, knowingly conducted or facilitated a significant financial transaction:

I have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the authority to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement the order.
I am enclosing a copy of the order I have issued.
DONALD J. TRUMP
The White House,

NOTE: The message referred to Executive Order 13871.
