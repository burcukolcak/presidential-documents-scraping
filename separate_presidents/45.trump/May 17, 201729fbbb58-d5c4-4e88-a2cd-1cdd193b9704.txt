Statement on the Appointment of Former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert S. Mueller III as Special Counsel To Oversee the Investigation of Russian Government Efforts To Influence the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters
As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know: There was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity. I look forward to this matter concluding quickly. In the meantime, I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our country.
