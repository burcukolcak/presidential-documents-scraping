Letter to Congressional Leaders on Suspending Generalized System of Preferences Program Benefits to Thailand
Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
Pursuant to section 502(d)(3) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2462(d)(3)), I am hereby advising you of my intent to suspend the duty-free treatment accorded under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program to certain eligible articles that are the product of Thailand, effective 6 months from the date of my proclamation.
After considering the criteria set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c)), in particular section 502(c)(7) (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(7)), I have determined that Thailand is not taking steps to afford workers in Thailand internationally recognized worker rights. Accordingly, I have determined that it is appropriate to suspend the duty-free treatment accorded under the GSP to certain eligible articles that are the product of Thailand.
The United States remains committed to fair and reciprocal trade with Thailand.
Sincerely,
DONALD J. TRUMP
