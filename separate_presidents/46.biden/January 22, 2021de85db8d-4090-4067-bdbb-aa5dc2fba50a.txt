Statement on the 48th Anniversary of the Supreme Court Decision in Roe v. Wade
Today marks the 48th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark ruling inRoev.Wade.
In the past 4 years, reproductive health, including the right to choose, has been under relentless and extreme attack. We are deeply committed to making sure everyone has access to care—including reproductive health care—regardless of income, race, ZIP Code, health insurance status, or immigration status.
The Biden-Harris administration is committed to codifyingRoev.Wadeand appointing judges that respect foundational precedents likeRoe. We are also committed to ensuring that we work to eliminate maternal and infant health disparities, increase access to contraception, and support families economically so that all parents can raise their families with dignity. This commitment extends to our critical work on health outcomes around the world.
As the Biden-Harris administration begins in this critical moment, now is the time to rededicate ourselves to ensuring that all individuals have access to the health care they need.
