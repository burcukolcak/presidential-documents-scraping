Remarks in an Exchange With Reporters During a Tour of McHenry County College in Crystal Lake, Illinois
Senate Minority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell
Q. Mr. President, Mitch McConnell says you're in for a heck of a fight on this one.
The President.Mitch McConnell loves our programs. Did you see what Mitch McConnel said? He told me he wasn't going to get a single vote in order to allow me to get, with the help of everybody here, that $1.9 trillion tax cut—I mean, excuse me, program to—for economic growth.
Look it up, man. He's bragging about in Kentucky: "It's a great thing for Kentucky. It's getting $4 billion to help poor." It's amazing. Check out Mitch McConnell. You can even see it on TV.
Anyway, thanks. Thank you.
Q.Mr. President, is Vladimir Putin ignoring your warning?
NOTE: The President spoke at 1:22 p.m. in the Children's Learning Center. A reporter referred to President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia.
