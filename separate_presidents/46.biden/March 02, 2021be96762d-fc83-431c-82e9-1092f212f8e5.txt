Letter from Neera Tanden to President Biden Withdrawing Her Nomination
Dear President Biden,
I am writing to you to withdraw my nomination for Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It has been an honor of a lifetime to be considered for this role and for the faith placed in me.
I appreciate how hard you and your team at the White House has worked to win my confirmation. Unfortunately, it now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation, and I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities.
I am incredibly grateful for your leadership on behalf of the American people and for your agenda that will make such a transformative difference in people's lives.
Sincerely,
Neera Tanden
