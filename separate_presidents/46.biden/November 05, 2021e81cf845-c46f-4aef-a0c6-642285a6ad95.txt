Statement on Infrastructure, Jobs, Education, and Family Assistance Legislation
I am urging all Members to vote for both the rule for consideration of the Build Back Better Act and final passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill tonight. I am confident that during the week of November 15, the House will pass the Build Back Better Act.
NOTE: The statement referred to H. Res. 774; and H.R. 3684.
