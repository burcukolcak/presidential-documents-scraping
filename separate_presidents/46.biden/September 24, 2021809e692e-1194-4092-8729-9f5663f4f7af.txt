Joint Statement by President Biden, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japanâ€”Quad Principles on Technology Design, Development, Governance, and Use
The Quad countries (Australia, India, Japan, and the United States of America) affirm that the ways in which technology is designed, developed, governed, and used should be shaped by our shared democratic values and respect for universal human rights. Technology should make the lives of our citizens more secure, prosperous, and rewarding, addressing some of the world's greatest shared challenges, like equitable growth, climate change, energy security, and pandemic diseases. We are committed to fostering an open, accessible, and secure technology ecosystem, based on mutual trust and confidence, and we welcome all nations to support the following principles:
Support universal values.


Build trust, integrity, and resilience.











We welcome all nations to join us in pursuit of this shared vision for technologies, guided by these principles.
