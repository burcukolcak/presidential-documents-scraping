James Monroe
February 06, 1819

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
I transmit to Congress a copy of a letter from Governor Bibb to Major-General Jackson, connected with the late military operations in Florida. This letter has been mislaid, or it would have been communicated with the other documents at the commencement of the session.
JAMES MONROE.
