In compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the19th of December last, requesting the President of the United States to communicate to the House the progress which has been made in the execution of the act of the last session entitled"Anact to abolish the Indian trading establishments," with a report from the factories, respectively, as the same were made to him, I transmit a report from the Secretary of the Treasury, with the documents referred to by that resolution. In further execution of the act of the last session treaties have since been made with the Osage and Sac Indians by which those tribes have severally relinquished to the United States their right under preceding treaties to the maintenance of a factory within each, respectively.
