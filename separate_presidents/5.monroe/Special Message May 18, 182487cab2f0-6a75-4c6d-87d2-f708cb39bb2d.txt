James Monroe
May 18, 1824

Special Message
To the House of Representatives of the United States:
I communicate to the House a report, with accompanying documents, received from Alexander Hamilton, one of the commissioners of land titles in East Florida, deeming the statements therein contained to be worthy of the particular attention of the House, and of a nature which may, perhaps, require their interposition or that of both branches of the Legislature.
JAMES MONROE.
