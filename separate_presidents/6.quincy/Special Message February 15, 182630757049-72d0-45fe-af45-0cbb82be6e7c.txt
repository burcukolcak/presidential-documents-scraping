February 15, 1826

Special Message
To the House of Representatives of the United States:
I transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the late Secretary of War to the late President of the United States, with documents, containing information requested by a resolution of the House of April 10, 1824, relating to the purchases of real estate in behalf of the United States within the territorial limits of any State since the 4th July, 1776.
These papers were prepared during the last session of Congress, but by some accident were not then communicated to the House.
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.
