John Quincy Adams
May 16, 1828

Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:
By a communication received from the charge' d'affaires of Prussia, a translation of which is herewith transmitted, it appears that in the ports of that Kingdom all discriminating duties so far as they affected the vessels of the United States and their cargoes have been abolished since the 15th of April, 1826. I recommend to the consideration of Congress a legislative provision whereby the reciprocal application of the same principle may be extended to Prussian vessels and their cargoes which may have arrived in the ports of the United States from and after that day.
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.
