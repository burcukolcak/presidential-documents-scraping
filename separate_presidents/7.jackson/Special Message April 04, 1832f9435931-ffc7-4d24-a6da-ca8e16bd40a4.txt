Special Message
To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith to Congress a report from the Secretary of State, showing the circumstances under which refuge was given on board the United States ship St. Louis, Captain Sloat, to the vice-president of the Republic of Peru and to General Miller, and the expense thereby incurred by Captain Sloat, for the payment of which there is no fund applicable to the case.
I recommend to Congress that provision be made for this and similar cases that may occur in future.
ANDREW JACKSON
