Special Message
To the Senate of the United States.
I submit to the consideration of the Senate two treaties--one of peace, the other of cession--concluded at Prairie du Chien on the 10th and 15th July, 1830, by commissioners duly authorized on the part of the United States and by deputations of the confederated tribes of Indians residing on the Upper Mississippi.
ANDREW JACKSON
