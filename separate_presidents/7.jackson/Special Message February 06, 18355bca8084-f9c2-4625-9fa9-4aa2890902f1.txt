February 06, 1835

Special Message
To the House of Representatives:
I submit to Congress a report from the Secretary of War, containing the evidence of certain claims to reservations under the fourteenth article of the treaty of 1830 with the Choctaws, which the locating agent has reserved from sale in conformity with instructions from the President, who did not consider himself authorized to direct their location.
Should Congress consider the claims just, it will be proper to pass a law authorizing their location, or satisfying them in some other way.
ANDREW JACKSON
