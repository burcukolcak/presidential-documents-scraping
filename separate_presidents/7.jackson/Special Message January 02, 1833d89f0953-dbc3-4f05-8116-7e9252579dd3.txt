Special Message
The SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:
I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State on the subject of the French shipPactole, upon the cargo of which a discriminating duty seems to have been levied in 1827 by the collector at Pensacola, in contravention, as is alleged, with the convention of 1822 with France.
ANDREW JACKSON
