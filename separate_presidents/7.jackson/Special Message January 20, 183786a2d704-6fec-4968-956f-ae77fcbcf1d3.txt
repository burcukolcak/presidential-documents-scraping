Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives.
In compliance with the act of Congress of the 3rd of March, 1829, I herewith transmit to Congress the report of the board of inspectors of the penitentiary of Washington, and beg leave to draw their attention to the fact presented with the report, "that the inspectors have received no compensation for their services for two years, viz, 1829 and 1830." and request that an appropriation be made for the same.
ANDREW JACKSON
