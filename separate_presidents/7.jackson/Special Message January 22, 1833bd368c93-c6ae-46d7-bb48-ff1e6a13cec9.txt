Andrew Jackson
January 22, 1833

Special Message
To the Senate.
Having received on yesterday certified copies of the acts passed by the State of South Carolina to carry into effect her ordinance of nullification, which were referred to in my message of the 16th instant to Congress, I now transmit them.
As but one copy of these acts was sent to me, I am prevented from communicating them by a joint message to the two Houses of Congress.
ANDREW JACKSON
