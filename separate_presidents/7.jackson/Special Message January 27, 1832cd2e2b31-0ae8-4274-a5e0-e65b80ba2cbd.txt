Andrew Jackson
January 27, 1832

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
Since the dismission of Lieutenant Hampton Westcott for participating as second in a duel in March, A. D. 1830, a more particular investigation of the circumstances has resulted in exonerating him from having instigated the fatal meeting, and the said Westcott, on a trial by a jury, has been acquitted of all legal guilt in the transaction.
I therefore nominate the said Hampton Westcott to be a lieutenant in the Navy of the United States from the 17th of May, 1828, his former date, and to take rank next after Richard R. McMullin.
ANDREW JACKSON
