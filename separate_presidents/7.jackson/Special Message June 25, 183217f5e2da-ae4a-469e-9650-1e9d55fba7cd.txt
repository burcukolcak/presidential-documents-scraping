Andrew Jackson
June 25, 1832

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States:
I herewith transmit to the Senate a report from the Secretary of State, on the subject of the abolition of discriminating duties on the tonnage of Spanish vessels. As it requires legislative enactment, I recommend it to the early attention of Congress.
ANDREW JACKSON
(The same message was sent to the House of Representatives.)
