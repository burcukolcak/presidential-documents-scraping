Special Message
The SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:
I submit for the sanction of Congress certain proposals for amending the present laws in relation to the naval service, prepared and reported by the board constituted under the act of May 19, 1832.
The papers on this subject are Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive.
These proposals are approved by me, and if adopted in the form of laws appear well suited "to the present and future exigencies of that important arm of national defense."
ANDREW JACKSON
