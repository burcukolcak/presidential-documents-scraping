Special Message
To the Senate of the United States.
GENTLEMEN: It having been represented to me that some of the members of the Senate voted against the confirmation of the appointment of Major M. M. Noah as surveyor of the port of New York through misapprehension, and having received the accompanying letter and memorial from a number of the most respectable merchants and citizens of that city, setting forth his fitness for the office, I therefore renominate him to the Senate as surveyor of the customs for the port of New York.
ANDREW JACKSON
