Martin van Buren
February 21, 1839

Special Message
To the Senate of the United States.
I transmit for the constitutional action of the Senate articles supplementary to the treaty with the Chippewas, for the purchase of 40 acres of land at the mouth of the Saginaw River, which are esteemed necessary in the erection and use of a light-house at that point.
M. VAN BUREN.
