To the Senate of the United States.
I transmit herewith, in compliance with a resolution of the 30th ultimo, the proceedings of the court of inquiry in the case of Lieutenant-Colonel Brunt,* held at St. Louis in November last, and the papers connected therewith, together with a copy of that officer's resignation.
The report of the Secretary of War which accompanies these papers contains the reasons for withholding the proceedings of the court-martial.
