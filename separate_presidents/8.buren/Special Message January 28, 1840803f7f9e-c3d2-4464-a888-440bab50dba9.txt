Special Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States.
I present for your information a communication from the Secretary of War, accompanied by a report and documents from the Chief Engineer, in relation to certain works* under the superintendence of that officer during the past year. These documents were intended as a supplement to the annual report of the Chief Engineer, which was laid before Congress at the commencement of the session.
M. VAN BUREN.
