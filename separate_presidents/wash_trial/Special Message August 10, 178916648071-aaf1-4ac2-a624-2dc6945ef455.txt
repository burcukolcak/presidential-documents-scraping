George Washington
August 10, 1789

Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate:
I have directed a statement of the troops in the service of the United States to be laid before you for your information.
These troops were raised by virtue of the resolves of Congress of the 20th October, 1786, and the 3d of October, 1787, in order to protect the frontiers from the depredations of the hostile Indians, to prevent all intrusions on the public lands, and to facilitate the surveying and selling of the same for the purpose of reducing the public debt.
As these important objects continue to require the aid of the troops, it is necessary that the establishment thereof should in all respects be conformed by law to the Constitution of the United States.
GO. WASHINGTON.
