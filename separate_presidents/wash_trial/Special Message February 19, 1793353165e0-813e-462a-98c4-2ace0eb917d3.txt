George Washington
February 19, 1793

Special Message
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:
It has been agreed on the part of the United States that a treaty or conference shall be held at the ensuing season with the hostile Indians northwest of the Ohio, in order to remove, if possible, all causes of difference and to establish a solid peace with them.
As the estimates heretofore presented to the House for the current year did not contemplate this object, it will be proper that an express provision be made by law as well for the general expenses of the treaty as to establish the compensation to be allowed the commissioners who shall be appointed for the purpose.
I shall therefore direct the Secretary of War to lay before you an estimate of the expenses which may probably attend this measure.
GO. WASHINGTON
