Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate:
Mr. Jefferson, the present minister of the United States at the Court of France, having applied for permission to return home for a few months, and it appearing to me proper to comply with his request, it becomes necessary that some person be appointedto take chargeof our affairs at that Court during his absence.
For this purpose I nominate William Short, esq., and request your advice on the propriety of appointing him.
There are in the Office for Foreign Affairs papers which will acquaint you with his character, and which Mr. Jay has my directions to lay before you at such time as you may think proper to assign.
GO. WASHINGTON.
