George Washington
May 28, 1796

Special Message
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
The extraordinary expenses to be incurred in the present year in supporting our foreign intercourse I find will require a provision beyond the ordinary appropriation and the additional $20,000 already granted.
I have directed an estimate to be made, which is sent herewith, and will exhibit the deficiency for which an appropriation appears to be necessary.
GO. WASHINGTON.
